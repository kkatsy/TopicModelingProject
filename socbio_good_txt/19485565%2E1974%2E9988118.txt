Gender Preferences, Sex Predetermination,
and Family Size in the United States

 

Phillips Cutright, Stephen Belt, and John Scanzoni

Depariment of Sociology

Bloomington, Indiana

Studies of preferences for children of a
given sex (Heer and Smith, 1968; Markle
and Nam, 1971; Coombs, 1973) suggest
that completed fertility might be lowered
if couples were able to predetermine the
gender of their children. This paper is concerned with past and current research on
gender preference and the likely impact of
sex predetermination on family size among
white couples in the United States. What
may be said of the methodological adequacy
of the research on U.S. samples from which
estimates of an effect of sex predetermination are drawn? Are estimates based on studies in the past likely to apply to American
wives in the future? If estimates of sex
predetermination effects differ among studies, can such variability be explained?

There are two distinct lines of work that
bear on the likely effects on fertility of sex
predetermination. One research style asks
people about their preferences for children
of each gender. Depending on the responses, the researcher then ponders the
likely impact of sex predetermination on
fertility (Markle and Nam, 1971). Quantitative estimates of predetermination effects based solely on gender preference responses have been offered. For example,
Keyfitz (1971, p. 119) reports the prefer
ences for boys and girls from a recent study
of young couples in Hull, England. Given
the normal sex ratio at birth, these couples
would have to average 3.7 children (rather
than their mean desired number of 2.55)
to achieve the number of children of each
sex they want. Such calculations may provide only a maximum and quite unrealistic
estimate of the possible effect of sex predetermination in lowering fertility because
a mathematical exercise does not prove that
completed family size among these couples
will be 3.7, rather than 2.55, without sex
predetermination.

There is substantial recent evidence from
Great Britain (Coombs, 1973, Table 4)
that parity progression ratios (the probability for an added birth to women at a
given parity) are not related to the gender
of the first two or three children, a fact
suggesting that couples who do not achieve
the number of children of the desired gender have no more children than couples
lucky enough to have these preferences
fulfilled.

The vulnerability of gender preferences
to change is illustrated by Clare and Kiser’s
(1951) analysis of gender preference responses of husbands and wives in the 1941
Indianapolis study, the first large interview

study of factors relating to fertility in an
American population that represented a significant segment of white adults. Couples
reported their preferences for children of
each gender, and these responses were crosstabulated with the actual sex of their children. Since the questions on preferences
were asked more than a decade after marriage, they provide an opportunity to study
the likely impact of the actual sex of children born on responses to gender preference questions.

In the case of couples with one child,
Clare and Kiser (1951, Table 3) note that
the gender preference expressed by wives
was heavily related to the actual sex of
their child. Among mothers with one male
child, only 8 per cent said they would have
preferred a girl in a single-child family;
among mothers of one female child, 69 per
cent said they would prefer a girl in a
single-child family. When asked to state a
gender preference for a two-child family,
50 per cent of mothers with two boys said
they preferred two boys; less than 2 per
cent of mothers who had borne two girls
stated they would rather have had two
boys. Additional tabulations by Clare and
Kiser (1951) reinforce the conclusion that
child gender preferences are conditioned by
the actual experiences of husbands and
wives. Given the results of the Indianapolis
work, it is not surprising that researchers
designing later American fertility studies
turned to more direct methods to estimate
the impact of gender of children on fertility.

The second approach classifies respondents (usually wives) according to their
parity at interview and the sex of children
already born. For example, at second parity,
there are four types of couples, although
these are usually grouped into just two
types—couples with same-sex children and
those with children of different genders.
The dependent variables differ according
to study design. When a longitudinal or

Sex Predetermination and Family Size

 

243

retrospective design is employed, the parity
progression ratios for some period after the
birth of the second child are recorded. Diiferences in parity progression ratios between couples whose children are of the
same or of different sex are assumed to
measure the effect on fertility of same-sex
offspring compared to different-sex offspring.

An alternative dependent variable employed in cross-sectional designs computes
intended family size and compares the
mean number of children intended, or the
percentage of wives who say they intend
to have more children, across the sex-ofchild codes. The three following large-scale
surveys have reported sex-of-child effects.

Freedman et al., (1960, Table 1) examined responses of a national probability sample of fecund white wives aged 18—
39, living with their husbands, who were
respondents in the 1955 Growth of American Families Study (GAF). Within each
current parity group with two, three, or
four children, they classified wives by
whether they had children of the same
sex or of different sexes. Among wives
with two children of the same sex, 63 per
cent of the respondents said they expected
to have more children, while only 59 per
cent of wives with a boy and a girl said
they expected to have more children, a
difference of 4 per cent. This 4 per cent
difference was interpreted to mean that
because most couples prefer a child of each
sex, those couples not having this combination at second parity will be more
likely to go on to have another child. No
data on the actual child-gender preferences prior to the first or second birth
are available; therefore, the allocation of
the 4 per cent difference to a gender
preference is speculative.

The 1957 Princeton Fertility Study
(Bumpass and Westoff, 1970) was a probability sample of mothers who delivered a

second child in September, 1956. The
sample was drawn from birth records of
whites in seven of the eight largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The
third wave of interviewing was completed
in 1967, at which time most mothers had
completed childbearing. After classifying
second-parity mothers by the sex of their
first two children, subsequent births were
used to calculate parity progression ratios.
Among second-parity wives with a boy and
a girl, 62 per cent had a third child, compared to 73 per cent of wives with two
children of the same sex (Bumpass and
Westoff, 1970, p. 94). This 11 percentage
point difference is attributed to the difference in the sex of the first two children,
with the unmeasured intervening variable,
again, being child-gender preferences.
Bumpass and Westoff also report that
parity progression ratios at higher parities
favor the idea that wives in their sample
were more likely to have another child if
they had children of the same rather than
different genders, even at the fourth parity.

Coombs (1973, Table 2) has reanalyzed
1965 National Fertility Study (NFS) data.
Among couples with two children, she reports that 70 per cent of those with a
boy and a girl said they wanted mo more
children, while 64 per cent of those with
two girls and 61 per cent of those with
two boys said they wanted no more children. The latter two figures may suggest a
stronger preference for at least one girl
than for one boy. Second-parity couples
in 1965 with a boy and a girl were about
7 per cent more likely than couples with
same-sex children to say they wanted no
more children.

Unlike the 1955 GAF and 1957 Princeton Study, 1965 NFS data show no difference in the per cent saying they wanted
no more children (80 per cent) among
third parity couples, by sex of the first
three children. This contrasts sharply with

Cutright, Belt,

and Scanzoni Social Biology
both earlier reports. It is impossible to test
adequately the likely causes of this difference because none of the three studies
we have discussed are comparable in sample characteristics or the dependent variable used to measure the sex-of-child effect
on actual or intended fertility.

We can say that the evidence from these
three studies, in spite of a lack of comparability, points to a small effect of the
gender of child among second-parity mothers. This effect is presumed to be caused
by gender preferences.

Whether a sex-of-child effect can continue under lower family-size norms than
those held by women in 1965 and earlier
years is questionable, and we offer some data
from a 1971 sample of second-parity wives
whose intended family size (2.39) is far
below the 3.3 level reported (and later
achieved) by second-parity wives in the
1957 Princeton Survey. At issue is the
question of whether sex predetermination
could make a difference in fertility when
family-size norms are lower than they were
in the past.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A probability sample of urban white
wives aged 18-44 living with their first
husband in five North Central states was drawn and interviewed by National Analysts in the summer of 1971. There were
273 wives with just two children in a
sample of 1,123 white wives (see Scanzoni, 1974, for additional details).

To assess the probable impact of having
two children of the same sex or of different sexes on completed fertility of these
mothers, we use two measures. The first
is similar to that used by Freedman et al.
(1960), that is, the percentage of wives
who say they intend to have additional
children. The second measure is the mean
number of children intended.

Analysis, a form of multiple regression
analysis using dummy variables, the characteristics of the sample that are known
to be related to intended family size are
displayed and put under statistical control
(Andrews et al., 1967). Adjusted deviations of categories for each independent
variable from the grand mean provides a
measure of net impact of each variable.

RESULTS

Table 1, column 1, shows the number
of wives with given characteristics. Only
26.4 per cent of these 273 second-parity
mothers intended to have more than two
children, a figure much lower than the 61
per cent of similar wives expecting more
children in the 1955 GAF Study (Freedman et al., 1961, Table 1), the 67 per cent

of mothers in the 1957 Princeton Study
who went on to have a third birth (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970, Table 37), or the
34 per cent of second-parity mothers in
the 1965 NFS study who said they wanted
more than two children (Coombs, 1973,
Table 2).

Five characteristics that might affect
birth intentions are considered: husband’s
1970 income; wife’s education, religion,
and age at interview; and the sex of the
first two children. The relationship of
these independent variables to the dependent variable is expressed in terms of
deviations around the mean of 26.4 per
cent intending to have more children.

Column 2 of Table 1 shows the deviations from the mean for the categories of
each independent variable before the rela

tionships among the independent variables
and their relationships to the dependent
variable are considered. The patterns
shown by these gross deviations are familiar. Couples more likely than the average to intend to have more children have
fewer years of school, are Catholic, and
are young. Couples with children of the
same sex tend to be only slightly more
likely than couples with a boy and a girl
to intend to have a third child. When the
categories of children of the same sex or
of different sexes are combined, the percentage difference is 3.1 per cent.

Column 3 shows the net effects of categories on intended births, controlling all
independent variables except wife’s age.
In general, the pattern of net effects is
quite similar to the pattern shown without these statistical controls. However,
when wife’s age is included (Column 4),
the association of husband’s 1970 income
and wife’s education to birth intentions
changes, because these characteristics are
related to age of the wife. Comparison of
the deviations from the mean percentage
intending more children among wife’s age
categories, with and without statistical
controls, shows little impact from the introduction of control variables. Also, the
bottom row shows that explained variance
is more than doubled when wife’s age is
included. We conclude that wife’s age is an
important variable, even within the same
parity, for controlling variation in birth
intentions that might otherwise be incorrectly attributed to education or income.

The use of wife’s age as an added control variable does not produce marked
changes in the relationship of the sex-ofchild variable to birth intentions. When
categories of children of the same sex or
of different sexes are combined, the percentage point difference is only 2.7 per
cent. This difference is not statistically
significant, nor is the zero-order relation
 

Cutright, Belt,

and Scanzoni Social Biology
ship of the sex-of-child measure to birth
intentions significant. Still, the direction of
this relationship is similar to that reported
by previous investigators, and it may be
worthwhile to provide a check on the assumption that such percentage differences,
using this type of measure, allow the conclusion that completed family size will be
larger among couples with children of the
same sex rather than different sexes.

The possible impact of sex of children
may be better measured by comparing the
mean number of children intended than
by percentage point differences in the proportion intending to have at least one
more child.

Mean intended family size for white
wives at the second parity in our 1971
sample was 2.39. Among the 153 wives
with a boy and a girl, the mean number
intended in 1971 was 2.41; the mean for
the 120 wives with children of the same
sex was 2.37. Thus, although the measure
of the per cent intending additional births
suggested a small difference favoring the
hypothesis of a sex-of-child effect, this
alternative measure finds that wives with
a boy and a girl intend on the average to
have larger families than do wives with
children of the same sex.

Analysis of mean intended family size
among wives at the third or higher parities
in the 1971 sample yields a similar finding.
Among the 222 high-parity wives whose
first two children included a boy and a
girl, mean intended family size was 4.24;
among the 200 high-parity wives whose
first two births were both boys or both
girls, mean intended family size was 4.19.

These unexpected findings from both
second-parity and_ third-or-higher-parity
wives may suggest that less direct indicators of sex-of-child effects on fertility
(e.g., the percentage wanting no more, the
percentage intending to have more children, or the percentage going on to the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

next parity) may yield results that are
dissimilar to those obtained from measures
of intended or actual completed family
size. Presumably, the sex-of-child effect
in which demographers are most interested
is measured by completed family size.

DISCUSSION

In our 1971 sample, neither secondparity nor third-or-higher—parity white
wives displayed the expected effect of sex
of children on mean intended family size.
The 1971 data did not reveal a significant
impact of sex of children on birth intentions, with or without statistical controls
for sample characteristics that might lead
to spurious conclusions.

Differences in the strength of effects of
gender of children on intentions for additional births among _ second-or-higher—
parity mothers between this and earlier
studies may be related to family-size
norms, even though gender preferences do
not change. Of course, if preferences are
not strong, then a sex-of-child effect should
not emerge, regardless of family-size norms.
However, if preferences do exist, their impact on birth plans of second-parity mothers will be more likely to appear if the
norms favor three rather. than two children.

Since existing studies on sex-of-child
effects among white American couples do
not use comparable measures, the conclusion that effects existed in the 1955, 1957,
and 1965 studies, but not in the 1971
survey, is more of a qualified judgment
than a verifiable statement. Still, we believe that this may be the case, and we
suggest that this difference in sex-of-child
effects among the studies is probably a
function of changes in the level of intended
numbers of children. Between 1955 and
1965, expected family size remained fairly
stable and above 3.0 (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1972, Table A). The decline in
expected family size occurred after 1965.
As family-size norms move from around

Sex Predetermination and Family Size

 

 

247

three to about two children, effects related
to actual sex of the first two children
may be suppressed. If so, the decline in
family-size norms after 1965 may account
for the difference between our 1971 results
and those from earlier studies.

Had we found a sex-of-child effect of
significant size in 1971, it would have
implied that future fertility might be reduced if sex predetermination were available, even under current small family
norms. Since we did not find an effect in
1971, we conclude that sex predetermination, were it now available, would probably
have little impact on the fertility of white
wives in the United States.

The demographic effect of sex predetermination technology is not likely to
equal the size of a sex-of-child effect, if it
exists. Had we an adequate measure
(which we do not) of this effect on the
completed fertility of birth cohorts, the
ability of predetermination techniques to
lower fertility by that amount would require that 100 per cent of the population
have access to, and make 100 per cent
effective use of, the predetermination
method. Such levels of access and use effectiveness are unlikely, suggesting that
the impact of a new innovation in medical
technology to allow sex predetermination
would affect only some fraction of those
births stemming from a sex-of-child effect.
Under small family-size norms, the future
impact of sex predetermination on the
completed fertility of white wives in the
United States appears negligible, barring
an unforeseen large shift in the strength
of preferences for children of one or the
other gender.
