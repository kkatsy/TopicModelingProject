ABSTRACT: Using data collected from a Native Canadian community by Embree (1993), we examine the influence of personal and family background characteristics on satisfaction with
spousal relationships, both legal marriages and cohabitations. Of special interest are the quality
of relationships with parents while growing up, alcohol abuse by the parent(s), and the experience of sexual abuse during childhood. Personal traits such as age, sex, and gender role attitudes
and the respondent’s own drinking behavior are also considered. Path analytic techniques model
both the direct effects of independent variables on relationship satisfaction as well as the role of
personal consumption of alcohol as an intervening variable in level of satisfaction with a relationship. The results of the analysis indicate that personal consumption of alcohol and the experience of sexual abuse during childhood are the best direct predictors of level of satisfaction with
the current relationship, with higher alcohol consumption and experience of sexual abuse related to lower satisfaction. Age also has a significant direct, though smaller, positive influence on
relationship satisfaction. Sexual abuse and the respondent’s sex are also linked to level of satisfaction through personal alcohol consumption. With, personal alcohol use, both the respondent’s
sex and the experience of sexual abuse during childhood have a significant effect, with males
and those sexually abused as children reporting higher levels of alcohol consumption. The socialization explanation of the intergenerational consequences of parental behavior argues that
parental role models are primary to the future family formation behavior of children. Consistent
with this hypothesis, the findings concerning sexual abuse, in particular, as a predictor of both
personal alcohol use and relationship satisfaction seem to underscore the importance of antecedent family characteristics in influencing later adjustment to adult roles and responsibilities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MODEL TO BE TESTED

Specific personal and background characteristics examined in this analysis for
their effects on relationship satisfaction

Relationship Satisfaction 43

are: the age, sex, and gender role attitudes
of the respondent; personal consumption of
alcohol; the quality of relationships with
parents while growing up; the experience
of sexual abuse as a child; and parental alcohol abuse during childhood. Concerning
the respondent’s personal characteristics,
on the basis of past literature age is predicted to be positively and directly related
to relationship satisfaction due to presumed
greater levels of personal maturity and relationship skills at older ages; age may also
be a proxy for relationship duration, a fac~
tor which would be selective of stable,
more satisfying unions at older ages. Respondent’s age may also be related indirectly to relationship satisfaction through
the personal consumption of alcohol. At
older ages, alcohol consumption is typically lower which would, in tum, predict
greater relationship satisfaction. Alcohol
overuse or abuse, thus, is expected to be
negatively related to relationship happiness. Given males’ higher consumption of
alcohol, sex is expected to predict indirectly relationship happiness through level
of alcohol consumption. Although it may
also be argued that relationship dissatisfaction may lead to excessive drinking in
some cases, evidence from the present sample on the timing of alcohol use onset indicates that heavier drinkers begin significantly earlier than non-drinkers or light
drinkers (at the survey date) and are, therefore, likely to have established drinking patterns prior to forming a long-term union. In
the context of this study, then, problem
drinking can be viewed more as personal
behavior as opposed to a situational response. Gender role attitudes are hypothesized to impact directly on partner satisfaction, with those holding the most
egalitarian attitudes enjoying the most satisfying relationships.

As for the family background characteristics, previous research suggests that
the experience of sexual abuse relates
negatively and directly to relationship satisfaction due to poor emotional and sexual
adjustment; and given clinical evidence
for a greater risk of substance abuse
among children from abusive _ backgrounds (Singer et al., 1989), sexual abuse
may also be indirectly connected to relationship quality through a positive relationship with level of personal alcohol
consumption. Parental drinking, furthermore, is expected to relate positively and
directly to personal alcohol use due to
children’s modelling of parental behavior;
parental alcohol consumption is also expected to relate negatively and indirectly
to relationship satisfaction through alcohol consumption. Finally, the variables
measuring quality of relationships with
mother and father while growing up are
hypothesized to relate positively and directly to relationship satisfaction, and indirectly through their negative association
with personal alcohol consumption. Along
with parental alcohol abuse, the quality of
childhood relationships with mother and
father are thought to be positively correlated, and with similar consequences for
the quality of the home environment as
would be implied by a positive association between drinking problems by the
parents.

DATA

The data for this analysis are based on
a randomly selected sample gathered by
one of the authors (Embree, 1993) of 876
adults from a Canadian Native community. For the purpose of this study, the
sample consists of 523 individuals, ages
19 and over, who reported living with a
partner at the time of the interview. Some

Social Biology

basic characteristics of this group are as
follows: about 28 per cent are male; almost 26 per cent are between ages 19 and
29; 50 per cent are between ages 30 and
49; and 24 per cent are 50 or older. Fortytwo per cent of respondents reported the
highest possible level of relationship satisfaction on the given scale measure.
Whereas thirty-seven per cent of respondents failed to answer the question on alcohol consumption, a further twenty-one
per cent reported having consumed no alcoholic beverages in the 30 days preceding the survey. Almost 42 per cent had a
father (or father substitute) with a drinking problem whereas 16 per cent reported
a drinking problem by the mother (or
mother substitute). Twenty-seven per cent
of this subsample also reported being a
victim of sexual abuse during childhood,
83 per cent of whom were female.

Some caution is due regarding the accuracy of this sample in view of the large
proportion of missing cases, for males in
particular, and on the alcohol use question
(i.e., likely underestimating actual use). It
is well known that use of a random sampling strategy alone cannot guarantee that
final response rates will be proportional to
representation in the population. The generalizability of this sample to other Native
communities may also be limited by the
diverse geographical and cultural experiences of reserve residents. (For further information about the survey and sampling
procedures, see Embree 1993.

Given the number of missing responses on the alcohol consumption item, it is
useful to examine further possible effects
of non-response on variables related to
consumption. Table 1 presents mean values for all variables in the analysis, for the
sample as a whole, as well as according to
whether the respondent answered the

consumption in average values on all of
the other variables in the model demonStrates that sample bias due to non-response on the alcohol consumption question is not an issue.

Multiple linear regression is used to
assess first the impact of a variety of personal and family background characteristics on satisfaction with the current
partner relationship. A further regression

model identifies significant predictors of
personal consumption of alcohol, the intervening variable hypothesized by the
model. Path analytic techniques are then
used to map out the direct effects of the
specified independent variables on relationship satisfaction as well as the role of
personal consumption of alcohol as an intervening variable in level of satisfaction
with a partner relationship.

The regression models, based as they
are on single equations, show the effect of
a given independent variable on the dependent variable, with all other variables in
the model held constant. They cannot,
therefore, reveal or distinguish direct and
indirect effects of independent variables
on a dependent variable. Path analysis is
useful in suggesting causal or dynamic
structures which permit examination of a
system of relationships between and
among variables; it does so by indicating
whether the measured statistical associations are consistent with the assumptions
made about interrelationships among the
variables of interest.

The dependent variable consists of a
summated scale based on six items concerning the respondent’s subjective evaluation of his or her partner, each with five
response categories. This scaled variable
is measured at the (quasi)interval level,
with high values indicating high satisfaction with the spousal relationship. The alpha reliability coefficient for this variable
is 0.92. Since only those individuals currently in unions are included in the analysis, there may be some selectivity in favor
of surviving (and presumably more successful) relationships. The dependent variable measures not only the respondent’s
subjective appraisal of his or her partner,
but also reflects the relevant criteria for
choosing and staying with a partner with
given qualities. Accordingly, to some extent the independent variables in the
analysis may be thought of as determinants of the respondent’s selection of a
partner with given characteristics in addition to one’s satisfaction with that partner.

The independent variables in the analysis of relationship satisfaction include
the respondent’s sex, age and gender role
attitudes, personal drinking habits, quality of relationship with the mother and father while growing up, and the experience of sexual abuse as a child. Sex is
measured at the nominal level, with females as the reference category. Age is
measured in single years at the interval/
ratio level. Gender role attitudes is an interval-type scale variable based on summation of seven items about men’s and
women’s roles, each with five response
categories. This variable reflects level of
egalitarianism in gender relations, with
higher values on this variable meaning
more egalitarian attitudes. The alpha coefficient for this variable is 0.70. Personal
drinking refers to the number of alcoholic

Social Biology

beverages (beer, wine, or liquor) consumed by the respondent over the 30
days prior to the survey. Quality of relationships with the mother and father (or
parental substitute) while growing up are
also scale measures based on summation
of six items about the quality of relationship with the parent, each with five response levels. The alpha reliability coefficients for quality of relations with mother
and father, respectively, are 0.87 and
0.89. Sexual abuse is measured at the
nominal level according to whether the
respondent was ever abused sexually as a
child. Those not experiencing abuse of
this nature serve as the reference category. Since the measure of sexual abuse
used here does not differentiate between
abuse from a family or non-family individual, it must be assumed that the occurrence of sexual abuse generally reflects
certain conditions and characteristics of
the child’s home environment (such as
parental competence or involvement with
the child) in which the abuse took place.

Bivariate correlation coefficients for
all variables used in the multivariate
analyses are shown in Table 2. Figure 1
illustrates the path model tested in this
study, including the multivariate parameter estimates for all hypothesized relationships between the independent variables and relationship satisfaction and
personal alcohol use.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The zero-order correlations of all variables in the path analysis are based on
206 cases obtained through listwise deletion of missing values. Overall, the bivariate correlations are consistent with
many of the hypotheses presented earlier
about the determinants of satisfaction

with a partner relationship. Age, as expected, is positively and significantly associated with relationship satisfaction (r
= 0.180, a = 0.01), as is egalitarian attitude toward gender roles (r = 0.162, a =
0.05). Personal alcohol use also stands out
as a significant predictor of relationship
happiness (r = —0.254, a = 0.001). Considering the family background characteristics, sexual abuse is significantly and

f& that consumption does not decrease with

Aurning to the family background characteristics, we see that none of the other hypothesized associations with personal
drinking are statistically significant. As
predicted by the path model which follows, however, parental drinking problems covary quite strongly and are positively associated (r = 0.415, a = 0.001);
quality of relations with the mother and
father during childhood are also mutually
and significantly related in the expected
direction (r = 0.339, a = 0.001).

Relationship Satisfaction 49

In addition to these predicted effects,
there are certain other notable correlations
among the independent variables that relate to family dynamics. The results concerning sexual abuse in particular seem to
stand out. For example, females are significantly more likely to be sexually
abused as children compared to males (r=
0.135, a S 0.05). The occurrence of sexual abuse is also positively and significantly associated with drinking problems
by the mother (r = 0.238, a = 0.001) and
the father (r = 0.289, a = 0.001). Sexual
abuse also correlates negatively and significantly with quality of relations with
the parents (r = 0.227, a = 0.001 for
mother relationship and r = —0.135, a =
0.05 for father relationship) which indicates that the more satisfying the relationship with the parent, the lower the likelihood of sexual abuse. The directions of
these associations, however, are not perfectly clear. The correlations between
parental alcoho! abuse and quality of relations with parents are also significant.
Mother’s drinking problem is negatively
correlated with both the quality of
mother relationship (r = —0.289, a =
0.001) and father relationship (r =
—0.150, a = 0.05); father’s drinking
problem is similarly associated with the
quality of relationship with mother (r =
—0.287, a = 0.001) and father (r =
—0.441, a = 0.001).

Cross-tabular analyses of sexual abuse
during childhood with parental drinking
problems confirm some important features of the associations just described. In
particular, father’s alcohol abuse is significantly and clearly associated with the occurrence of sexual abuse. Among the 27
per cent of the sample reporting sexual
abuse during childhood, two-thirds had
a father with a drinking problem (x? =

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

50 Embree and De Wit

27.64, df = 1, p = 0.001). The figures associated with mother’s drinking problem
are similar, although less dramatic: Of
those who weren’t abused as children,
about 10 per cent had a mother who
abused alcohol. This figure compares
with 32 per cent of sexually abused respondents whose mother had a drinking
problem (x? = 28.30, df = 1, p = 0.001).
Although not conclusive, these preliminary analyses are revealing about the
complex of factors which may characterize family life and, according to the socialization model, also be transmitted
across generations via parental modelling.

The path analysis in Figure 1 shows
standardized beta coefficients (8) for all
paths linking the independent variables
with alcohol use and relationship satisfaction. The figure shows that age is significantly and positively related to relationship satisfaction (B = 0.158, a = 0.01).
As noted earlier, greater levels of satisfaction at older ages may be due, in part,
to an overrepresentation of respondents
with more durable (and thus presumably
more satisfying) relationships. However,
since a measure of union duration was
not available from the data, this possible
explanation cannot be confirmed.

The only other significant direct effects
on relationship satisfaction are for personal alcohol use (B = —0.222, a =
0.001) and sexual abuse (B = —0.227, a
= 0.001). Further analysis of the relationship between consumption and relationship satisfaction reveals a clear linear
trend. Dividing the sample on the relationship satisfaction variable into approximate thirds, the mean consumption levels according to satisfaction are 31 drinks
monthly for those expressing the most
satisfying relations; 37 drinks for those
with moderate levels of satisfaction, and

Social Biology

63 drinks on average for those with the
lowest level of relationship satisfaction.
The effect of respondent’s sex is indirect
through a positive association with personal drinking (B = 0.223, a = 0.01).
Sexual abuse is also linked to relationship
satisfaction through its significant association with personal alcohol consumption
(B = 0.176, a <= 0.05). Here, the emergence of a significant effect in the multivariate context indicates the presence of a
suppressor variable. Additional analysis
on this question reveals a significant interaction between sex and sexual victimization in childhood, and shows that the
original bivariate relationship between
sexual abuse and drinking behavior had
been suppressed by the absence of a control for respondent’s sex. Specifically, the
effect of sexual abuse on consumption
patterns, while non-significant for females, is quite strongly positive and significant for males B = 0.325, a = 0.01).
This result, while requiring further investigation, appears to point to notable sex
differences in strategies for coping with
the stress and trauma of sexual abuse (see
Windle et al., 1995 for clinical evidence
to this effect).

It is also important to note in the context of this discussion that the sexual
abuse item used in this study appears to
measure the real extent of the problem
in this Native community. Given evidence from the data that the drinking patterns of non-abused respondents and nonrespondents are similar (1.e., later onset of
drinking for both of these groups compared to the known abused group), it may
be inferred that non-respondents on the
sexual abuse question were unlikely to
have been victimized. None of the other
variables measuring family background
quality are significantly related to rela
 

 
 

Vol. 44, No. 1-2

tionship satisfaction, either directly or
through alcohol consumption. In discussing the bivariate results, however, it
was noted that mother’s and father’s
drinking problems correlate significantly,
as is the case with the quality of relations
with mother and father while growing up.
Many of the hypotheses tested in this
study involving family background, personal drinking behavior, and relationship
Satisfaction are based on theory and findings about non-Native populations. Evint differences, then, in patterns of regilts obtained for this Native population
seem to confirm the social and cultural
ehiqueness of this group, quite apart from
well-documented demographic  differences in fertility and mortality. For examwe, while alcohol consumption generally
@éclines over the life course (Addiction
Research Foundation, 1983), this pattern
es not appear to hold true for the Native
pulation studied here where the multiYariate results show no significant associaion between age and consumption.
9 Such differences aside, one very use1 finding which does emerge after controlling for the effects of all of the other
family background characteristics inSlves the significant role of sexual
abuse. Due to the extremely sensitive naGre of the topic and especially when it
volves incest, sexual abuse is a problem
which is seriously understudied. In many
cases, sexual abuse in childhood can be
seen to reflect the failure of the family
system to regulate sexual activity in the
interest of the child. Consistent with recent research on the relationship between
childhood physical and sexual victimization and adult mental disorders (see Windle et al., 1995), the bivariate analysis in
this study found a significant and fairly
strong association between the occurrence

 

 

Relationship Satisfaction 51

of sexual abuse and parental abuse of alcohol. Such a finding helps to underscore
the interrelatedness of various conditions
and features of family life, some of which
may be more prevalent in, but certainly
not specific to, Native populations.

The consequences of childhood sexual
abuse may be devastating in both the short
term and the long run. Recent work on the
subject of long-term effects of sexual
abuse demonstrates a positive correlation
between childhood sexual abuse involving
penetration and marital disruption as well
as dissatisfaction with one’s sexual relationship (see Finkelhor, 1989). Related
research also reveals a close association
between victims’ families of origin characteristics and characteristics of their
families of procreation (Carson et al.,
1991). Romans et al. (1995) report that
sexual abuse in childhood is associated
with later incidents of deliberate selfharm and with becoming involved in further abusive relationships as an adult. The
occurrence of sexual abuse, therefore,
may be regarded not only as a serious
problem from the perspective of the victim but can also be interpreted as the failure of the family system to meet its members’ primary needs. This failure in
family functioning ultimately undermines
victims’ ability to adjust successfully to
adult roles and responsibilities later in
life. In view of these possible linkages,
the present study has attempted to demonstrate an association between the occurrence of sexual abuse and satisfaction
with one’s partner relationship, both directly and though its impact on personal
alcohol use. These associations were supported by data which show a significant

results involving sexual abuse thus support the socialization model regarding the
intergenerational transmission of family
quality.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

A number of important issues have
been raised by this investigation. One
concerns the sample size used for the
analysis. Thirty-seven per cent of the
original 523 cases (193 respondents)
failed to answer the question on personal
alcohol use. The non-response rate on
this variable, thus, is fairly high, most
likely due to the sensitive nature of this
question, especially for Natives. Given
the number of missing cases on the alcohol consumption variable, the use of listwise deletion resulted in a relatively
small final sample size. Nevertheless,
given the theoretical and empirical importance attached to alcohol consumption
for both non-Native and Native populations in explaining patterns of family life,
it was essential to retain this variable in
the analysis. Moreover, given the likely
reason for non-response (i.e., stigma associated with alcohol use and abuse
among Natives), the sample used in the
present study is most likely selective of
non-drinkers or moderate drinkers, which
may actually afford a conservative test of
the relationship between personal alcohol
use and relationship satisfaction. As determined above, further analysis of the
non-responding subset of cases on the
drinking behavior question revealed that
differences in the characteristics of respondents and non-respondents were
negligible.

A further issue is that of the importance of proper temporal sequencing of

Social Biology

the hypothesized causal processes. Given
the retrospective nature of much of the
data, a major strength of this study lies in
specifying many of the relationships
based on proper time sequencing of the
variables of interest. This factor is especially important in attempting to attribute
alcohol use and relationship quality during adulthood to earlier characteristics
and events of the home environment during childhood. Additionally, the use of
path analysis which is based on assumptions about proper causal ordering among
the variables proved to be particularly appropriate for examining the role of alcohol consumption in the association between background characteristics and
relationship satisfaction. Notwithstanding
the strengths of this approach, it must be
remembered that effects are only inferred
and all causal conclusions, therefore,
must be treated tentatively.

Future research on the determinants of
relationship quality may benefit from distinguishing between married and cohabiting partners in order to see whether there
are differences for these two groups in
the predictors of satisfaction. A comparison of those currently in a union with
those who are not might also reveal the
extent to which the various independent
variables predict the tendency to divorce
of persons in less than satisfactory marriages. Since unsatisfactory relationships
are more likely to dissolve than satisfactory ones, the determinants of marital satisfaction may be different for the two
groups. This approach would reduce the
selectivity of the sample and allow the researcher to say something about the more
general determinants of relationship satisfaction. The possibility of a spurious association between features of the family
of orientation and satisfaction with the

family of procreation should also be examined. For instance, some unmeasured
factor such as a family subculture may be
uncovered which explains both the quality of the childhood home environment
and the current partner relationship. Accordingly, a variable such as sexual abuse
during childhood may not directly cause
dissatisfaction in a subsequent relationship. Further investigation of the question
BY significant sex differences in alcohol
consumption among the sexually abused
siso seems warranted by the findings.

® To sum up the major findings from the
path analysis, among the effects tested,
personal consumption of alcohol and the
Experience of sexual abuse during childtrood are the best direct predictors of sattsfaction with the partner relationship,
with higher consumption and experience
ap sexual abuse related to lower satisfacfron. Age also has a significant direct
though smaller positive influence on relatronship satisfaction. Sexual abuse and
thie respondent’s sex are also linked to retionship satisfaction through personal
cohol consumption. These indirect effects, therefore, can be seen to comprise a
sequence of events in which the occurrence of childhood sexual abuse leads to
greater alcohol use which, in tum, is imflicated in less satisfying marriage and
family relations. As for the determinants
of personal alcohol use, both the respondent’s sex and the experience of sexual
abuse during childhood have a significant

 

Relationship Satisfaction 53

effect: males and those sexually abused
as children report higher levels of alcohol
consumption. None of the other family
background characteristics were found to
impact significantly on either alcohol use
or relationship quality, a result which
seems to attest to the distinctiveness of
Native populations vis-a-vis non-Natives.
Despite the apparent uniqueness of the
Native population, the findings concerning sexual abuse as a predictor of both
personal alcohol use and relationship satisfaction nevertheless reflect the importance of certain antecedent family characteristics in influencing later adjustment to
adult roles and responsibilities. This conclusion is supported further by the related
finding from the bivariate analysis of a
significant positive association between
sexual abuse during childhood and parental drinking problems. The socialization
explanation of the intergenerational consequences of parental behavior argues
that parental role models are primary to
the future family formation behavior of
children. Consistent with the hypothesis,
an important conclusion from this study
regarding the experience of sexual abuse
in particular is that marriage and family
quality can be transmitted across generations. This model of family relationship
dynamics may, therefore, apply appropriately to Native as well as non-Native communities and may be used effectively to
guide future social interventions aimed at
enhancing successful family functioning.
