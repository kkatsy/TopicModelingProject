Color Blindness, Culture, and Selection

Ajit Kisor Ray

Department of Human Genetics

Leiden, Holland

Post (1962) has suggested that selection
against sex-linked color blindness has relaxed under certain ecological conditions resulting from cultural growth. This hypothesis is based on the high frequencies of
color blindness in Europe, the Middle East,
and Far East contrasted with low frequencies among a number of primitive populations. While the published data on color
vision among populations in different stages
of cultural growth generally support this
hypothesis, there are, nevertheless, exceptions among primitive (Rivers, 1905; Sarkar,
1958; Fernandes et al., 1957) and rural
(Dronamraju and Meera Khan, 1961) populations. The published results should be regarded with certain reservations, since the
use of different techniques by different
workers may introduce bias in the comparisons of various populations.

The purpose of the present study has
been to determine the frequencies of color
blindness among populations in different
cultural stages from three eastern states of
India and to evaluate their significance in
relation to the relaxation hypothesis as
postulated by Post (1962).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

During 1963-64, 2,917 male students
from 13 high schools in the states of West

 

Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa were screened by
the author, using Ishihara plates Nos. 1-25
(1960 edition).

Urban population. In Calcutta, West
Bengal, 843 students were screened from 3
missionary schools. The city of Calcutta was
founded by traders of the British East India
Company in 1694, or approximately ten generations ago, and is now considered India’s
largest urban center with a cosmopolitan
population from different parts of the country. The majority of the students tested
belong to Anglo-Indian, upper-caste Bengali, Chinese, Punjabi, and Muslim populations. The Chinese have been residents of
Calcutta for some four or five generations.

Rural population. In rural Orissa, 1,703
students were screened from 8 public schools
in the coastal district of Puri. The students
belong to various castes and subcastes.

Tribal population. To obtain a sample
from tribal populations, 371 students were
screened from 2 missionary schools in
Ranchi, Bihar, and from a boarding school
in Bhubaneswar, Orissa. The students from
Orissa belong to different tribes, and their
birthplaces cover almost the entire state of
Orissa.

The overall prevalence of color blindness
in the present study is 0.037 (109/2917). Of
the 109 color-blind males, 32 are protan and

77 deuteran. It is convenient to treat the
present material in three broad categories
classified according to the degree of urbanization: (a) Urban, (6) Rural, and (c) Tribal.
Table 1 summarizes the data and shows a
slightly higher incidence of color blindness
among Urban males. However, as shown in
Table 2, this difference is not statistically
significant (x? = 1.81, p < 0.50), nor is the
prevalence rate in the Urban populations
(0.042, based on 843 students) strikingly
higher than the incidence among pooled
samples of rural and tribal populations
(0.035, based on total of 2,074 students).
There is an uneven distribution of color
blindness among rural groups (x?=
22.69, p< 0.001), with the highest incidence in the lowest castes (see Table 3).
The deuteran-protan ratios for Urban,
Rural, and Tribal groups are 4:1, 2:0, and
1:5, respectively.

INFLUENCE OF CASTE

The concept of caste came from four
varnas (colors): Brahmin (Priest and
Teacher), Khatriya (Warrior), Vaishya
(Trader), and Sudra (Cultivator). Each
caste belongs to one of these varnas, and
traditionally most castes and subcastes engaged in a particular occupation. It is not
castes, but subcastes, that are genetically
isolated groups. The hierarchical structure
of the caste system restricts not only intermarriage but also social and ritual intercourse between them. For purposes of the
present study, the castes from rural Orissa
have been classified as Upper, Middle, and
Lower according to their social distance.
Gene diffusion from Upper to Middle or
Middle to Lower and vice-versa is very
rare, although the chance of gene diffusion
from Middle to Upper is greater than from
Lower to Middle. Thus, the classification
of caste suggested here has a biological basis
and would seem useful for the analysis of
the rural population of India.

Social Biology

The most outstanding feature emerging
from Table 1 is the high rate (0.15) of color
blindness within the Low-caste group in
rural Orissa. This prevalence among the
Low-caste group might be due to random
genetic drift in these castes because of their
small population sizes. As these castes are
homogeneously “high,” it would seem more
likely that the four populations (Bhoi, Hadi,
Dhoba, and Kandara) of the Low-caste
group have shared a common gene pool in
the past and that the original gene frequencies have persisted after their separation. These populations have racial and
cultural affinities.

The Middle-caste group is not far from
the Upper caste, with a prevalence rate of
0.030 and 0.033 respectively. The Middle
caste is unique in showing significant heterogeneity, although the variances do not
differ significantly between the five population groups (p = 0.2 according to Bartlett’s
test). The high incidence of color blindness
among four Middle-caste populations
(Malia, Buallisi, Gudia, and Bhandari) of
small size may have been established by
chance and then perpetuated. Genetic drift
is also possible. It may be mentioned that
the Malia and Buallisi with their small
population size (around 1,500 and 2,000,
respectively) carefully avoid cousin marriages and are confined to one or two settlements of Puri district, Orissa. Very little
can be said about the frequencies among
tribal populations, as the samples are very
small,

SELECTION INTENSITIES

Analyzing the variance in color blindness
frequency into various components we obtain Table 4. The two degrees of freedom
among the three populations yield a nonsignificant regression on “Urbanism” (taken
to be 1, 0, and —1 arbitrarily for the three
populations) and a nonsignificant residual.

A similar analysis for the three caste groups
in the rural populations yields a significant
residual only, pointing to a “random”
heterogeneity rather than to a consistent
influence of “civilization.” A similar heterogeneity is present among the “castes” (this
term taken to denote all the lowest subdivisions mentioned in Table 1) within the
caste groups.

In view of the finding of different prevalences of color blindness in different popula

tions, it is of some interest to try to calculate the intensities of selection that would
be needed to produce such differences in
gene frequencies. Dr. W. S. Volkers has
calculated the intensities of selection that
would be needed to produce these differences. We will derive some general formulas
(implicitly used by Post [1962]) and apply
them to the urban-tribal difference.

In this formula, p is the frequency of a
gene g and q that of its allele G(p + ¢ = 1);
x is the time measured in generations;
pw and y are the frequencies of mutation
g—G and G-— g, respectively; # and d are
the proportions of the genes in the haploid
and diploid state (h +d = 1); s and # are
the selection coefficients against the two
hemizygotes; S and T are the selection coefficients against the homozygotes, reckoning from the heterozygote; and M is twice
the excess over Mendelian expectation of
the G gene in gametes from the heterozygote.

Taking g to be a rare recessive sex-linked
gene, with normal mutational and segregational properties, we get approximately:

dp _ sp

Suppose now that we have two nonallelic genes g; and ge. Then,

for which we may again write

keeping in mind that now p and V are aggregate frequencies, and s is a weighted
mean selection coefficient.

In order to apply our formulae to an
actual case, where we have but one degree
of freedom, we have to simplify still more.
Let us assume there is a base (tribal) population to be indicated by the subscript ‘0”
which may be considered to be in equilibrium. Then,

Hence, taking p = 0.0427, po = 0.0269, and
x= 10, we get V=0,0015, and 5) =
0.1762.

These numbers may seem a bit high, but
not very much can be done about it. In fact,
assuming V = V, = 0 instead of s = 0, we

Thus, starting from the estimated gene frequencies, the selection coefficients involved

are at least on the order of 10%; but we have
to keep in mind that the gene frequency
differences in fact are not significant, so
neither are such quantities derived from
them as V and So or So ~ S.

To explain the low incidence of the colorblindness gene or genes in lower stages of
culture and to understand its relationship
to biological fitness, we must consider the
rate of inbreeding (for female gene frequency), population size, family size, migration rate, rate of incidence in different age
and occupational groups, and sample size,
which might give us evidence of selection.
The need for large samples is clear and
presents obvious difficulties. It is unlikely
that the role of selection can be understood
unless studies are planned and evaluated
properly. Post (1962) suggests that color
blindness is a greater handicap in primitive

populations than in higher levels of culture.
However, Penrose (1959) suggests that
“uncovering” of cryptic coloration by redgreen color blindness might have been advantageous to primitive hunting men and
that in modern warfare the color-blind may
sometimes be of use in picking out camouflaged targets. Commenting on Post’s
analysis, Ford (1965) remarks that redgreen color blindness could not have reached
the status of polymorphism unless the gene
responsible for the condition had been associated with advantages as well as disadvantages. On the other hand, Clarke (1965)
comments that red-green color blindness
now seems to be a neutral trait.

While the present material falls in line

Social Biology

with Post’s hypothesis, the difference in the
frequency of color blindness in long civilized,
as contrasted to recently civilized, populations is not statistically significant. Moreover, the finding of significant heterogenetties, explicable as drift and founder effects,
calls for caution in the interpretation of
data on the distribution of color blindness
among small tribal and non-tribal isolates.
