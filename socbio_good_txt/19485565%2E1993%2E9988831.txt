ABSTRACT: We extended the biosocial model of problem behavior tested by Udry (1990) to a
panel design, following a sample of over one hundred boys in adolescence for three years. We
found the expected results for sociological variables, but weaker effects for testosterone than
dry found on cross-sectional data. Using panel models with lagged hormone effects, we
Cidentified relationships between Time-1 testosterone and problem behavior one year or more
edater. The relationship between testosterone and problem behavior was not present for subsequent
wmeasures of testosterone, either in cross-section or with time-lagged models. Therefore we cannot
_-interpret the results as showing testosterone effects on problem behavior. Rather it appears that
“testosterone level in early adolescence is a marker for a more general growth trajectory of early

‘development.

In a recent paper, Udry (1990) pre‘Ssented a biosocial model of male ado=lescent problem behaviors in which he
‘showed that an empirical model based
Sn integrating biological and sociologsical theories of problem behavior gave
‘<both a better prediction of behavior
Pand a quite different picture of the
eauses of problem behavior than a
model based on either theory alone.
sThat paper was based on cross"ssectional data. The present paper exotends the first study to a panel analyis of a different sample. While the
present study partially replicates the
results of the first study, it comes to entirely different conclusions.

For the convenience of the reader,
we summarize the theoretical model
from the first paper. For the sociological model we rely on soctal control
theory as exemplified by Hirschi’s
(1969) theory. Hirschi maintains that
everyone is motivated to commit devi
1

ant acts, and that what needs to be explained is why, in the face of motivation, some do not. Hirschi maintains
that deviant acts are committed when
an individual loosens his/her bonds to
conventional society. Such bonds include (1) emotional attachment to conventional institutions (school, church,
etc.); (2) commitment to conventional
behavior; (3) involvement with conventional institutions; and (4) conventional beliefs.

Jessor and Jessor (1977) include
very similar constructs in their problem
behavior model of adolescence. They
have documented such changes as increased value of independence, decreased religiosity, decline in church
attendance, lower academic achievement values, and increased tolerance
for violation of adult standards. Jessor
and Jessor also guide the definition of
the dependent variable in our study:
the age-graded norm violations of

adolescence, including smoking cigarettes, having sex, drinking alcohol,
and similar behaviors.

While the sociological model takes
motivation for granted and focuses on
the constraints, the biological model
focuses on the differences in motivation for problem behaviors. In this
sense the two theories are complementary rather than contradictory. The
biological model hypothesizes that
“male” hormones increase the predisposition of adolescents to problem behavior. The specific androgenic hormone of focus is testosterone, the most
behaviorally potent male hormone. It
has been proposed that the dramatic
increases in testosterone in adolescent
males may provide an explanation of
the corresponding sharp rise in deviance for which sociological models fail
to account (Hirschi and Gottfriedson,
1985; Gove, 1985). The link between
testosterone and a variety of normviolating behaviors (aggression, sexual
behavior, anti-social acts, and domi
-‘nance) has been the subject of two de
cades of research (Udry, 1988; Kruetz
and Rose, 1972; Olweus et al., 1980;
among others).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS

One hundred twenty-six boys age 12
and 13 were randomly selected from a
list of pupils in a public-school system
of a medium-sized southern city. The
school district was selected based upon
the availability of a list of pupils.
About 50 per cent of those eligible
agreed to participate and completed
the study. Informed consent was first
obtained from a parent, then from the
respondent. Subjects were paid a cash

 

Social Biology

incentive of $400 (maximum) for their
participation.

PROCEDURE

The respondents were followed for
a period of three years. Subjects were
administered a questionnaire at first
contact and every six months thereafter for two years. A final follow-up
was conducted at the end of the third
year. Nurse/interviewers administered
the questionnaire, collected blood
samples, and performed physical examinations for measures of pubertal
development.

Collection, storage, and assay of
blood samples. —Blood samples were
collected at six-month intervals, for a
total of six sampling periods for each
subject. The samples were collected in
the subjects’ homes between 3 and 7
P.M. by a nurse. Because there are
short-term pulsatile releases of certain
hormones into the blood, collection
was made uSing a butterfly needle inserted in a suitable arm vein and obtaining three 6-ml samples at 15minute intervals. The three samples
were immediately pooled and the serum separated. The serum was then
stored at —70 C until assay.

Testosterone assays were performed using the Diagnostics Products
Corporation 1125 Coat-a-Count kit.
Testosterone binding globulin (SHBG)
assays were performed using the Farmos Diagnostica 1125 kit. All samples
were assayed in duplicate and, for a
subset of the specimens, were crossvalidated against values generated
from two other labs. (See Halpern and
Udry, forthcoming, for a description of
the validation process.)

Social variables.—Data regarding
the social variables were collected

through the questionnaire administered every six months. The measures
were designed to incorporate elements
of both the Hirschi and Jessor and
Jessor models. Those social variables
measured include church attendance,
religiosity, age, age of friends, grades,
sports participation, homework, housework, and autonomy (who makes your
decisions). Also included were measures of socioeconomic status and family composition because both Hirschi
and Jessor and Jessor include such
variables in their analyses.

Problem behaviors.—The dependent variable, problem behaviors, was
~ first constructed by factor analysis of
=. 26 mild to serious deviant behaviors
~ which respondents had enacted in the
— preceding six months. Responses were
§, subjected to principal components fac‘tor analysis. Varimax rotation proS duced three factors with eigen-values
> greater than one. However, 24 of the
= 26 behaviors loaded most heavily on
the first factor, and all behaviors
‘= loaded at least 0.40 on that factor.
~ Therefore, the first factor was selected
= as the problem behavior scale. A simg ple additive index of the items pro3 duces empirical results which are vir‘= tually identical to those using the
2 loading scores resulting from the factor
© analysis. Therefore in the interest of

parsimony, the results are presented

using the additive index.

RESULTS

Results included in the present analyses are based upon the first three time
periods in which the boys participated.
The analyses were constructed using
ordinary least squares regression and
path analysis. The analyses were con
Problem Behavior 3

ducted in a series of steps. First, regression analyses were completed separately for the social, the biological, and
the biosocial models predicting problem behavior across all three time periods to identify the appropriate variables to be included in each model.
Next, regression analyses were conducted for the three models at each of
the three time periods. Finally, lagged
regression analyses were conducted to
determine the possible effects of both
biological and social variables on later
problem behavior. The results are presented in terms of each model type.

A sociological model.—The sociological model was constructed by completing a backward elimination multiple regression of all sociological
variables predicting problem behavior
across all three time periods and subsequently at each time period, deleting
variables until all remaining were significant at the 0.10 level. Each deleted
variable was then re-entered singly
with the remaining variables to see if it
met the entry criterion. Each resultant
model is illustrated in Table 1.

The pattern of results is similar for
each time-period model. Autonomy
and religiosity consistently significantly
contribute to the overall model, with
autonomy positively related to problem behavior and religiosity negatively
related to problem behavior. Age of
male friends contributes to the overall
model, suggesting an age-graded effect, but does not contribute at either
Time 1 or Time 2. None of the other
social variables, including the SES or
family structure variables, consistently
contributes, if at all. Therefore, the sociological model chosen for subsequent
analyses includes autonomy and religiosity.

A_ simple biological model.—The
biological model was constructed by
completing a backward elimination
multiple regression of all biological
variables predicting problem behavior
across all three time periods and subsequently at each time period, deleting
variables until all remaining were significant at the 0.10 level. Each deleted
variable was then re-entered singly
with the remaining variables to see if it
met the entry criterion. Each resultant
model is illustrated in Table 2.

Testosterone is the only biological
variable that significantly predicted
problem behavior across the three time
periods. While testosterone itself does
not significantly predict at all three
time periods, it is the best biological
predictor and is thus the lone variable
included in the biological model.

completing a backward elimination
multiple regression of the biological
and social model variables predicting
problem behavior across all three time
periods and subsequently at each time
period, deleting variables until all remaining were significant at the 0.10
level. Each deleted variable was then
re-entered singly with the remaining
variables to see if it met the entry criterion. Each resultant model is illustrated in Table 3.

As indicated in the table, all three
model variables significantly contribute to an overall model spanning the
three time periods. The results of each
individual time period are less supportive of the inclusion of testosterone in
the model. Testosterone appears predictive only at Time 1 for the adolescents, and not at any subsequent time
periods. Such findings suggest the completion of a lagged path analysis.

A time-lagged integrated model. —
Separate analyses were conducted to
determine if a lagged biosocial model
would better predict problem behavior. It was speculated that the effects of
testosterone would be most evident on
later problem behaviors, and that these
effects could be mediated through the

mediated through religiosity and autonomy and are instead directly predictive of later problem behavior. Religiosity and autonomy remain in the
model as well. Thus, it appears that the
best model predicting adolescent male
problem behavior is a time-lagged biosocial model.

However, other time-lagged models
were also completed using a one-year
lag for testosterone effects on problem
behavior. None of the lagged analyses
beyond Time 1 were found to be significant. In fact, further exploration indicated that only Time-1 testosterone
had any effect on later problem behavior and that its relationship to problem behavior remained marginally significant at even Time 5 (r= 0.171,
p <0.110). Thus, high testosterone at
an early age is predictive of problem
behavior for up to three years later, but
later testosterone levels are not predictive.

DISCUSSION

A comparison of the results of the
present study with those of Udry
(1990) show two quite different pic
tures. In the first paper, the separate
biological and sociological models each
have an R? of 0.24, while the biosocial
model has an R? of 0.30, a significant
increase over the separate models. In
the present study, the sociological
model has an R? of 0.29 for the first
round, but the biological model, while
significant, shows only a minor hormone effect, with an R?2 of 0.06. The
biosocial model explains no more variance than the sociological model alone.
Cross-sectional results for subsequent
rounds show no biological effects at all.

The panel model for a one year lag
in hormone effects beginning with
Time 1 (Figure 1) shows a more substantial testosterone effect, along with
about equal effects for each of the two
sociological variables. But one-year lag
models beginning with testosterone for
any other round show no hormone effects at all. At the same time, Round-1
testosterone predicts problem behavior at all subsequent rounds, even up to
three years later. It is therefore impossible to identify the relationship between testosterone and subsequent behavior as a hormone effect.

Future research must explain why
boys with early high testosterone show
more problem behavior over the following years than boys with low testosterone. We lean toward the hypothesis that the early high testosterone is
an index of a more general trajectory
of early development. This trajectory
should be observable before puberty.
We already know from other studies
that boys who are bigger and more
muscular as prepubertal children have
earlier puberty. To test this hypothesis,
we need a sample of adolescent boys

Problem Behavior 7

for whom we have data on prepubertal
growth and behavior, and whose testosterone levels and problem behavior
we can follow in adolescence.
