Symposium on “Differences in Nutritional

Requirements Among and Within Human

Populations: Their Significance”
Sponsored by the Society for the

Study of Social Biology and AAAS Section G

The symposium will address the broad
topic of the interactions that exist between
the kinds and quantity of food and the
health and fertility of selected populations.
The need to individualize diets as a function of the differences that exist among
and within relatively endogamous groups
will be examined.

Held in conjunction with the meetings
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the symposium will
meet from 3 to 6 P.M. in the Century
Room of the Denver Hilton Hotel on
Tuesday, February 22, 1977, with Irving
I. Gottesman presiding.

The following papers will be presented:
“Food Intake, Fatness, and Fertility,”
Rose E. Frisch; “Genetic Aspects of Geographical Medicine,” Baruch S. Blumberg; “Diet by Disease Interactions: Vitamin E and Malaria,” John W. Eaton;
“Quality of Diet in the Pima Indians and
Diabetes,” Peter H. Bennett; and “Sucrose
Intolerance in Eskimos,” H. H. Draper.

For further information, write Dr. Irving I. Gottesman, Vice-President, Society
for the Study of Social Biology, Department of Psychology, Elliott Hall, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.
