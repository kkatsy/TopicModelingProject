Some Observations on the Decline in the
United States Dizygotic Twinning Rate

The observed decline in the United
States twinning rate over the period 1922~
58 (jJeanneret and MacMahon, 1962)
and through the early 1960’s (James,
1972) has not so far been adequately explained by examination of vital statistics
data. In the course of our work on the
inheritance of human twinning based on
data from the Genealogical Society of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (also called the Mormon Church)
at Salt Lake City, Utah, we have collected
data which may provide some insight into
factors that may account for the decline
in twinning rates among contemporary
American women.

The Genealogical Society is one of the
most active genealogical organizations in
the world. Latter-day Saints’ interest in
genealogy stems from the theological belief that family relationships and family
associations were intended to be eternal.
Latter-day Saint families gather genealogical data concerning their ancestors for
religious purposes, in order to perform
“sealing” ordinances in temples erected for
this purpose. Thus, although the organization of the church took place in 1830,
the collection of genealogical records in
 

cludes not only information on Mormons
themselves but ancestors of Mormons
who may have lived long before the church
existed. We have extracted data from the
entire collection of the Genealogical Society’s records.1

The data analyzed here are based on
7,421 completed sibships, each of which
contained at Jeast one set of twins. They
consist of families where the father was
born in 1800 or later. In nearly 90 per
cent of sibships, the father was born in
the United States; among the remainder,
the place of birth was Denmark, Sweden,
Norway, or Holland. The families are recorded in the Genealogical Society of the
Mormon Church but were not necessarily
Mormons,

In a previous paper (Wyshak and
White, 1965), we showed that unlike-sex
twins tend to be born at later birth orders
and to older mothers than do like-sex
twins, In families containing only one set
of twins, the number of sibs preceding likesex twins was smaller than the number
preceding unlike-sex twins, the mean numbers being 3.36 and 3.51, respectively.

the method of data collection.

nities preceding the birth of twins and the
mean number of maternities following the
birth of twins by maternal age and twin
type for sibships with one or more sets of
twins. The mean number is 3.48 preceding
like-sex twins and 3.55 preceding unlikesex twins, In age groups “under 20” and
*25~29 years,” the mean number of maternities preceding the birth of twins was
smaller for like-sex twins than for unlikesex twins; in age groups 20-24, 30-34,
35~39, 40-44, and 45 and over, the mean
number preceding wnlike-sex twins was
smaller.

Selvin (1972), reporting on 15,023 twin
pairs born to upstate New York women,
1960-67, found that mothers of like-sex
twins have a lower mean number of previous pregnancies than do mothers of unlike-sex twins. This finding held for all
maternal age groups (see Table 1). Differences between Selvin’s data and the
Mormon data are that the latter are based
on genealogical records, pertain to women

temporary cross-sectional data and represent incomplete fertility.?

The observed differences with respect to
mean number of maternities preceding the
birth of twins may reflect differences in
childbearing patterns during the two time
periods. These differences are also evident
in the distributions of the number of twins
born classified by maternal age. In our
data twins tend to be born to older
mothers than they do in Selvin’s. In our
series about 30 per cent of the twins born
were to women 35 and older; in Selvin’s,
about 16 per cent were to women these
ages.

The proportion of the twins that were
unlike-sex also differs. In the genealogical
data of the nineteenth century, 36.4 per
cent of the twins were unlike-sex; in contemporary data (Selvin, 1972) 31.8 per

2The effects of completed fertility versus incomplete fertility will not bias the differences in
the number of maternities preceding the birth of
twins.

cent of the twins were unlike-sex. This
difference may be due to the higher maternal ages at which twins were born in
earlier time periods,

The comparisons made above between
nineteenth-century data and contemporary
data provide a hypothesis that may account for the observed decline in dizygotic
twinning rates. That is, between the late
1920’s and early 1960’s the frequency of
twins among white births in the United
States declined. Jeanneret and MacMahon
(1962) concluded from their analysis of
trends by maternal age and by sex of twins
that the decline affected dizygotic twins
only. They were unable to account for this
decline.

A striking difference between the childbearing patterns of nineteenth-century
and twentieth-century women seems to be
the earlier cessation of childbearing among
the latter group of women, that is, a decrease in the fertility of women 35 and
over. This decrease is reflected in a comparison of our data with Selvin’s as well
as more directly and over a shorter period
of time in natality statistics for the United
States. From Table 2 we note that up to

Decline in Dizygotic Twinning Rate 169

difference in mean numbers of maternities
increases markedly by maternal age, and
at ages 40 and over the difference exceeds
two, the means being over 6 in our data
and about 4 in Selvin’s data at ages 40
and over. It is obvious then that contemporary women who had twins at age 40 or
over had fewer children preceding the
twins than did a comparable group of
women bearing children in the nineteenth
century.

The decreasing fertility of older women
over the period 1940-58 has been reported
in national natality statistics (see Table
3). During this period, the fertility rates
nearly doubled for women 20-24 years and
showed substantial increases in women up
to age 40. The per cent change in fertility
rates between 1940 and 1958 by maternal
age group showed a downward trend, from
-+90.1 per cent for age group 20-24 to
—52.6 per cent for age group 45-49 (Table 4). The per cent change in twin birth
rates by maternal age 1940-58 (Jeanneret
and MacMahon, 1962) showed a parallel
trend—--1.2 per cent for age group 20-24
and —~26.1 per cent for age group 45-49.

It appears that the decline in the over

change in rates for the comparison 1940
and 1968 show the same trends (Table 4).
For the years 1958 and 1968, the decline
in birth rates shows little variation among
the maternal age groups, a decline of
about 35 per cent (ranging from —25.9
per cent to —39.2 per cent). The per cent
changes in twin rates from 1958 to 1968
range from —9 per cent to -++-6 per cent.
The hypothesis that the decline in the
twin birth rate is related to the decrease in
the fertility of women 30 and over is supported by our findings in a previous paper
(Wyshak and White, 1969) which showed

that twinning is related to fertility. Women
who bore twins were more fertile—had
more children—than women who had singleton children only. The number of children born to twin bearers exceeded the
“extra” child that would be contributed
by a twin maternity. These findings were
based on data from completed families.
Czeizel and Acsadi (1971), reporting on
the decline in the frequency of multiple
births in Hungary, also related the decline
to decreasing fertility. They state (p. 311):
“As DZ frequency is interrelated to maternal age, the decrease of twinning in our

Vol. 22, No. 2

country can be ascribed to the reduced
fertility of mothers over 30-35.”

An additional consideration related to
the decline in the dizygotic twinning rate
may be that women who cease childbearing early are less likely to reach the optimal maternal age-birth order period for
twin bearing. The frequency of DZ twinning, as is well known, is related to both
maternal age and birth order. In 1964, for
US. white women, the highest DZ twinning rate occurred in age group 35-39, previous live births 7 and over; for U.S. Negro
women, the highest rate occurred in age
group 30-34, previous live births 7 and
over (National Center for Health Statistics, 1967).

Examination of the percentage distributions of live births by live-birth order
for selected maternal age groups—30-34,
35-39, 40-44, and 45-49—which have
been extracted from the U\S. vital statistics of 1940, 1958, and 1968 confirm this
point. In 1940, 41.5 per cent of live births
born to women 35~39 were of live-birth
order 6 or over; for 1958, the comparable
proportion was 30.0 per cent, and for
1968, 35.7 per cent. Similar decreases in
the proportions of live births at later birth
orders are found in maternal age groups
40-44 and 45-49 (see Table 5).

Natality statistics reinforce this obser
Decline in Dizygotic Twinning Rate 171

vation. The per cent of women with 3
births at exactly age 30 increased from
about 9 per cent in 1940 to 19 per cent in
1958. The result is that “younger childbearing increases the proportion of women
who have all the children they want by a
given age and thereby reduces the proportion of women who want additional children at later ages” (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1967, p. 7). Natality
Statistics Analysis, 1965-1967 reports:
“Since 1957, women who were having such
high (birth) rates earlier in the 1950’s ...
have been reaching the older ages of the
childbearing period. Since most of them
had all the children they wanted to have
while they were younger, they have been
having relatively low rates at the older
childbearing ages” (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1970, p. 3).

The evidence, though indirect, suggests
that the decline in dizygotic twinning rates
in the United States, even among older
women (35 and over), may be due to the
earlier age at which childbearing ceases
and other factors related to the lower fertility of older women.
