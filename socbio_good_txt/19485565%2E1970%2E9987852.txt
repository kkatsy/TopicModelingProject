This study is concerned with trends and
variations in childspacing in relation to age
at marriage, order of birth, education of
woman, and occupation of husband.?

Relatively few studies have been made on
childspacing and those are mostly based on
small samples. Among the important ones
are the Princeton Study (Westoff et al.,
1961) in which childspacing is a significant
variable for prediction of the third child for
couples with two children. A more recent
study on fertility and family planning in the
United States (Whelpton, Campbell, and
Patterson, 1966) based on data from a survey of 3,322 wives in 1960 deals mainly with
the analysis of data related to expectations
of births. Only one chapter is devoted to
socioeconomic differences in age at marriage
and spacing of births by order for several
birth cohorts of women. In contrast, the
data used in this paper are based on official
sources, the 1960 decennial census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968) and the 1965 Current Population Survey (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1969), and are somewhat limited in
scope as compared with the two studies
mentioned above. Their advantage, how

of the Census.

ever, over the other data is that they come
from larger samples and thus lend themselves to more conclusive results.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The ideal data for studies of childspacing
of course would be complete rosters of birth
dates of all children born alive to a couple,
including deceased offspring and those away
from home, However, truncated birth rosters are often used to save space on the
schedule, or money, or both. The 1965 Current Population Survey included a truncated birth roster to the extent that the collected data included birth dates of the first
four children, the next-to-last, and the last
child of fifth or higher order. The birth dates
for children intermediate between the fourth
and next-to-last were obtained through
linear interpolation (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1969).

Notwithstanding their limitations, the
data enable us to examine the impact of age
at marriage, education, and occupation of
husband on the cumulated childbearing
rates and intervals between first marriage
and first birth and between successive
births. We shall begin with a consideration
of cumulated births by age at marriage and
by order of birth for marriage cohorts between 1940 and 1964.

AGE AT MARRIAGE

Age at marriage is inversely related to the
number of children ever born. Some demographers claim that changes in marriage patterns do not have much effect on the ultimate number of children because most women marry early enough to have as many children as they desire. However, in this study,
tabulations of fertility by age at marriage
show that there exists an inverse relationship between age at marriage and fertility
(see Table 1). Age at marriage may be in

surge in marriages and births. As a consequence, women in each marriage cohort considered after 1944 had borne more first children and in shorter intervals since marriage.
Specifically, the cumulated first birth rate
per thousand women two years after marriage among white women was 491 for those
first married in 1940-44; 593 for those married in 1945-49; 620 for those married in
1950-54; and 677 for the marriage cohort of
1955-59, The rate for the marriage cohort of
1960-642 was practically the same, 673.

versely related to the number of children
women want. It is also possible that women
who marry early or have their children earlier at marriage are exposed to a longer
period of risk of having unwanted children.

ORDER OF BIRTH

First births -—The first-birth rates per
thousand women for the 1940-44 marriage
cohort were the lowest among all of the
1940-64 marriage cohorts considered (see
Table 2). This was a cohort of women who
married during the war years and thus many
husbands were absent from home. After the
end of the World War IT there was an up
 

Within 36 months after first marriage women in the 1955-59 marriage cohort had borne
783 first children compared with 766 for
women in the 1960-64 cohort (see Table 2),
This decrease in first births among the most
recent marriage cohorts after 36 months possibly was due to an increase in age at marriage and postponement of first births, a
view that has been expressed by other
demographers.

Second births —Women who married during 1945-59 not only had more first births

are fragmentary; this cohort was not married suffciently long to provide enough information.

but also more second births at shorter intervals than did women in the earlier marriage
cohort. The number of second births per
thousand women for the 1955-59 marriage
cohort was 733 after seven years of marriage, and the number of first births per
thousand women for the same period of time
was 894 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969,
Table 17), i.e., the cumulated birth rate for
children of second order was 82% as large as
that for first birth order. However, for the
1960-64 marriage cohort there was a slight
decline in number of second births per
thousand women as compared with the
1955-59 cohort. After 36 months of marriage, the cumulated second birth rate per
thousand women for the 1960-64 cohort was
319 compared with 334 for the 1955-59 cohort. For both marriage cohorts, however,
the cumulated second birth rates were about
42%, as high as the cumulated first birth
rates after 36 months of marriage (see Table 2).

Births of third and higher order-—The
1945-49 cohort also experienced an increase
in cumulative birth rates for children of
third order (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1969, Table 17). There is no satisfactory information available for children of fourth or
higher order since the cohorts have not been
married long enough to produce enough
births of fourth and higher order. Neither is
satisfactory information available for the
1960-64 marriage cohort with regard to
third or higher order births.

SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

Education—For most of the marriage
cohorts considered, the cumulative first and
second birth rates for women with four years
of high school were similar to those who reported some college. Women with less than
four years of high school tended to exhibit
somewhat higher childbearing rates. The
major difference between those with less
than four years of high school and the two
other groups was in the spacing of the first

Social Biology

and second births; women who reported less
than four years of high school tended to have
shorter intervals between first and second
births than those with four years of high
school or with one or more years of college
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table 19).

The most pronounced difference in cumulative childbearing by education can be observed for the third and higher order births.
The number of third and fourth or higher
order births per thousand women was larger
for women with Jess than four years of high
school than for those with four years of high
school, and that in turn was somewhat
larger than for women reporting one or more
years of college. Concomitant with large
cumulative birth rates for women with less
than four years of high school were short
intervals between marriage and third and
fourth order births (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table 19).

For women married between 1940-59
there tends to be an appreciable inverse relationship between the number of first births
per thousand women and educational attainment. For the 1950-59 and 1945-49 cohorts, however, women with one to three
years of high school had larger cumulative
first birth rates in the first and later years of
marriage than any other educational group
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 36).
This is in variance with the 1960 census data
on the relation between level of education
and number of children ever born. The relatively high rates of first births among women
reporting one to three years of high school
may be due partly to selection, i.e., some
women with one to three years of high
school may have dropped out of high school
in order to be married.

Birth intervals —The length of intervals
between births is to some extent a rough indication of future family size or patterns of
family formation. In general, the average
length of interval between marriage and
first birth and also between successive births
is inversely related to the number of children
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

Vol. 17, No. 2

a woman had borne. However, a short interval between marriage and first birth emphasizes a pattern of an early family formation.

The average length of interval between
marriage and first birth for white women
ever married, who were 35-39 years old in
1960 and who had an only child, was 43.2
months compared with an interval of 31.4
months for those with two children only.
Similarly, the average length of interval between marriage and first birth for women
with 3 children was 23.7 months compared
with 19.8 months for those women who had
borne 4 children (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 25).

The length of interval between marriage
and first birth increases consistently with
the educational level of women. This held
true not only for all women having one child
or more, but also for those having an only
child. However, this was not the case for intervals between successive births among
women of a specific parity. For example, the
average length of interval between first and
second births for women 35-39 years old
who had only two children was $1.8 months
for high school graduates and 54.3 months
for those with less than eight years of school.
The average interval between births of second and third children for women with three
children was 50.9 months for women who
completed high school and 52.1 for women
with less than eight years of school. Also
there was a rather consistent tendency for
intervals to be longer among women reporting one to three years of high school than for
women of higher educational status (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 25.)

Like the findings described above, the
length of intervals between births of a given
order was inversely related to the number of
children the woman had borne (see Table
3). However, there was less of a tendency for
the 1965 survey data than for the 1960 census data to yield a direct positive relation
between education and length of interval.

Variations in Childspacing

Ill

Among women with three or more children
the median length of interval between the
first and second children and second and
third children was larger for women with
four years of high school than for those with
less or more education (see Table 3). Among
those having two children there was an inverse relation of median length of interval to
education of women. There was no noticeable relationship between education of woman and length of interval between third and
fourth or higher order birth (Table 3).

Sampling variations might help account
for the lack of a direct relation. It is possible
that women with college education wanted
to have their children without a long delay,
since they married at an older age than those
who did not attend college. As for the relatively long intervals observed for the women
with one to three years of high school, the
excess was generally small. Whatever the
reason, the important point is that when
both age and parity are controlled there is
little relationship between education and
length of interval for first and higher order
births,

Occupation.—In general, there exists an
inverse relationship between cumulative
birth rates and occupational rank of husband for each marriage cohort between 1940
and 1959. The lowest cumulative fertility
rates per thousand women were for the
wives of professionals and clerical and sales
workers and the highest for the urban unskilled workers and for the farmers and farm
laborers. Comparison of the data by cohorts
suggests that between 1945 and 1959 there
was a narrowing of fertility rate differentials
between unskilled laborers and operatives
and kindred workers. ,

' It is also apparent (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1960, Table 37) that service workers
tended to have as low or even lower fertility
than professional workers. The explanation
sometimes given for the relatively low fertility of clerical workers possibly is applicable here also. Thus, clerical and service
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

workers may have aspirations of the professional workers and relatively low income. In
order to achieve the goals set by the professional class they try to control fertility (see
Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell, 1968). It
should be also mentioned that there exist
only small differentials between farmers,
farm managers, and farm laborers.

The 1965 Current Population Survey
data on cumulated births by order were
tabulated by four classes with reference to
the occupation group of husband: white collar, blue collar, service workers, and farm
laborers. The last two groups were too small
for a cross-classification by order of birth
and had to be omitted. The cumulated birth
rates for white collar and blue collar workers

-yielded differentials like those by education

(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table

Social Biology

23). For each cohort and each order of birth
considered, the cumulated fertility rate by
duration of marriage was consistently lower
for the white collar than blue collar classes.

SUMMARY

This paper discusses the impact of age at
marriage and education of wife on cumulative birth rates of first and higher order for
white women married between 1940 and
1964,

Education of wife was in general inversely
related to the cumulated birth rates for first
and higher orders. However, women who
completed one to three years of high school
exhibited somewhat higher birth rates than
did wives of less education, Perhaps women
with one to three years of high school were

selective of women who either wanted or had
to get married early.

The average interval between successive
births for white women 35 to 39 years old in
1960 was inversely related to the number of
children that the women had borne. In relation to educational attainment of woman,
the average length of interval between first
marriage and first birth showed the expected direct relation. For intervals between
successive births of second and higher order
this relationship did not hold consistently.
For example, in some instances the average
interval for women with less than eight
years of school was longer than for those

with college education. Women with one to
three years of high school consistently manifested somewhat longer intervals than women of the same parity in other educational
groups. No satisfactory explanation is available.

Occupational rank of husband was inversely related to the cumulative first and
higher order births for each marriage cohort
under consideration. Professional workers,
clerical and sales workers, and service workers tended to have relatively low cumulative
fertility rates and farmers, farm laborers,
and urban laborers tended to have rather
high cumulative birth rates.
