ABSTRACT: In an earlier study of 46 pairs of male twins, genetic determination of certain social
characteristics, speech, and vocabulary IQ was assessed at age 2.5 years. In a follow-up of 35 of
these pairs at age 9, genetic and environmental factors were examined again in the same
characteristics, as well as in antisocial and neurotic behavior, nonverbal ability, school
achievements, height, and weight. At 9, significant genetic variance, replicated via two
methods of calculation, was found in height, weight, nonverbal IQ, and antisocial behavior
(teacher’s rating). Shared family environmental influences were important for compliance,
conscience, and antisocial behavior (parents’ ratings). Social traits were thus less under genetic
influence than were physical and cognitive characteristics, and for antisocial behavior, genetic
and environmental factors were both important. Stable genetic determination across both ages

was found only for speech, measured by speech rate at age 2 and speech maturity at age 9.

The genotype is by definition a lifelong property of the organism. If a genetic contribution to the phenotypic expression of a given trait can be shown
only at one age, special mechanisms
(e.g., the switching on and off of genes
during development) may possibly explain the phenomenon (see below for a
discussion). However, if a trait can be
shown to have significant genetic variance repeatedly at different ages, the
demonstration of at least partial genetic
control becomes that much more convincing.

What is the evidence from existing
longitudinal twin studies about the extent and the areas in which genetic determination has been found repeatedly
at different ages? The major North
American study that has followed the
development of twins over age is the
Louisville Twin Study that comprises
about 300 twins whose mental test performance has been studied from 3

62

months to 15 years of age (Wilson, 1978,
1983). Genetic variance in IQ scores increased, and between-family environmental influences decreased, in this
sample between ages 1.5 and 8 years.
Summarizing these findings from an epigenetic perspective, Wilson (1978) concludes that “the course of mental development is guided by the intrinsic
scheduling of the genetic program acting
in concert with maturational status and
environmental influence” (p. 939).
Fiscubein (1981) traced the physical
and mental development of twins from 9
to 15 years of age in a sample initially of
323 pairs of twins. She found that in
logical-inductive ability, differences between the zygosity groups stayed the
same, implying a similar genetic component over age, whereas in verbal ability
dizygotic twin partners became less similar. The author interprets these results
as indicating that verbal ability is more
under environmental than genetic in

fluence. LaBuda et al. (1986) and DeFries et al. (1987) studied the genetic
stability of cognitive ability from one
year of age onward. They were able to
identify substantial genetic stability
from infancy to early childhood, and
from early childhood to adulthood, as
shown by significant genetic paths in
path-analyses.

The development of temperament or
wnpersonality characteristics in twins has
also been studied longitudinally by afew
researchers and a full review of such in‘Evestigations has been provided by GoldSsmith (1983). We will review these studies briefly. Goldsmith and Gottesman
S(1981) carried out a genetic analysis on
about 300 twin pairs from the Collabora“tive Perinatal Project. The twins were
Egiven ratings for temperamental qualiSties at 8 months, 4 years, and 7 years of
Eage. The evidence for a genetic contri=bution for these qualities was uneven.
4< Some aspects of temperament, €.g., acpiivity level, showed genetic variance at
gone age, but not at another, many did
2 not show it at all. In a reanalysis of a sub5 5 sample of these subjects, Goldsmith and
=McArdle (cited in Goldsmith, 1983)
gfound that the observed longitudinal
stability of a factor descriptive of emotional reactivity was accounted for
5 mainly by stable genetic factors.

A Matheny (1980) has demonstrated
some of the most consistent genetic variance over age in the Louisville twin sample. Behavioral variables were assessed
repeatedly between 3 and 24 months
and were reduced to factors by factor
analysis. The factor “task orientation”
showed the most stable genetic determination across age and the “‘profile of factors,” 1.e., the pattern of mean levels of
scores across all factors, also had a consistent genetic component across all
measurement occasions. Torgersen

 

Stability of Genetic Determination 63

(1981) in tracing the development of
temperamental characteristics in twins
from infancy to age 6 confirmed that
some of these twins display consistent
genetic determination across this age
span, but that environmental factors
may be more important for aspects of
temperament involved in the “difficult
child” syndrome.

Dworkin et al. (1976, 1977) carried
out an investigation of the genetic determination of personality traits, assessed
by the MMPI and the California Personality Inventory (CPI), at adolescence
and at adulthood, as well as of the
changes between those ages. The traits
of anxiety, depression, and dominance
showed significant genetic variance at
both adolescence and childhood, while
other traits exhibited it only at one age.
Genetic variance was also significant for
the profile contour of the CPI at adolescence and adulthood, and for the
changes between these ages.

Clearly, consistent genetic determination over age has been demonstrated
for cognitive ability and also for a few
personality traits. In the latter case, firm
conclusions are difficult, but it appears
that heritability of personality traits is
more consistent at adolescence and beyond than at younger ages (cf. Goldsmith, 1983).

A longitudinal investigation of the
social and cognitive development of
male twins, seen first at age 2.5 years
and again when they were 8-10 years
old, presented us with a welcome opportunity to reexamine the heritability of
the traits studied at the earlier age and
thus to address the question of stability
of genetic determination. The aim of the
investigation at age 2.5 years had been
first to relate the social characteristics of
attachment, independence, compliance, and internalized standards, plus

speech facility and vocabulary, to parents’ child-rearing practices, and second, to assess possible genetic determination of these characteristics (Lytton,
1980). At the time of follow-up, we were
able to estimate again the genetic variance of those characteristics that had already been submitted to a genetic analysis when the twins were 2.5 years old.
The genetic analysis was also extended
to characteristics measured for the first
time at age 9.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample of the original study consisted of 46 sets of male twins, 17 monozygotic (MZ) and 29 dizygotic (DZ).
Mean age was 32.2 months, with a range
of 25-35 months.

Twins were located through the birth
registers of the local hospitals, and they
represented almost the total male twin
population born during 1969 and 1970 in
Calgary, Canada. The sample contained
one-third middle class and two-thirds
working class families (all white), as assessed by father’s occupation (Blishen,
1967).

At follow-up at 8-10 years of age, we
were able to locate 43 of the 46 original
twin families. We received consent to
obtain information from school records
on 37 pairs, and 35 pairs (13 MZ and 22
DZ) participated fully in the investigation. The mean age of the twins was 9
years 6 months, and the range was 8
years 5 months to 10 years 8 months.

The methods of the investigation
when the twins were 2.5 years old are
described in detail in Lytton (1980). Observations of unstructured interactions
between parents and children in the
home, coded in detail, yielded summary
behavior counts. Mothers were asked to
write a “diary” account of all events in
 

Social Biology

volving the child within a 24-hour period, and they were given a standard interview. The interview followed a
structured interview format with possibilities for extra probes. It was concerned with parents’ perceptions of their
children’s personality characteristics
and with parents’ attitudes and practices
in relation to child-rearing. Based on
the combined evidence of the observations, the “diary,” and specified interview questions, we rated the children on
the target characteristics and the mothers on their child-rearing practices and
attitudes.

The Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test (Dunn, 1965) was administered to
the children by a trained psychologist in
an experimental playroom.

At age 9 the children were assessed at
home and at school. The purpose of the
home-based assessments was to obtain
measures on the same social characteristics of the children that had been assessed at age 2 (see above), plus measures of twin and peer relations, and the
children’s social adjustment. In addition, present family roles and relationships were to be assessed. However, a
structured family interaction session
(FI) was substituted for the observation
of unstructured parent-child interaction, because of the greater selfconsciousness of 9-year-old children in
the presence of an observer.

An interview was given to mothers
and fathers separately. This interview
paralleled in content and form the interview which had been given to mothers at
the time of the earlier study. The interviews were taped and later transcribed.
The rater-interviewer rated a given trait
on a5-point scale, on the basis of the responses to all questions related to this
trait. For a few traits the observations
from the FI were also taken into ac

count. Inter-rater reliabilities, established by having a second rater rate six
protocols, had a median of 0.88, with
only two falling below 0.70.
Child traits that were studied at age 2
(see above) were repeated and defined
in an identical way, but interview questions were modified in accordance with
changed age expectations. A question
on quality of peer relations was added to
wthe original set of questions.
S Each parent also completed Rutter’s
sChildren’s Behavior Questionnaire
"=(CBQ), which is a screening test for psySchological maladjustment, with parallel
Sforms for parents and teachers. Its reliaSbility and validity (Rutter et al., 1970)
Yare satisfactory. Individual items are
“added up to form a total Maladjustment
score, as well as a Neurotic subscore and
gan Antisocial subscore.
The second home visit was devoted
Sto the observation of family interaction
4(FI) revolving round three structured
ptasks, which were designed to elicit famBily roles, relationships, and interactions.
zThe tasks were: (1) a common construcStion with Lego, (2) “Pull for Pennies,” a
peame adapted from the Madsen Cooperation Board (Madsen, 1967), and (3) a
zy 3 family discussion on topics set by the in-<vestigator, concerning the disposition of
S .
=money earned in Pull for Pennies and
Atypical disciplinary problems in the
home. The session was videotaped and
transcribed. Counts of certain interactive behaviors and ratings for cooperation in the Pull for Pennies task were
converted to 7-scores and combined to
form the summary variables: Dominance, Organization of Task Activity,
Cooperation, and Conflict. Thirty-four
families participated in the FI. Reliabilities for the FI counts were calculated by
having two researchers code two segments from the videotapes of each of six

Michiga

families. The reliabilities ranged from
0.72 to 0.99, with a median of 0.85.

At school, classroom teachers were
asked to complete a Child Rating Scale
of 28 items. The scale was devised to
measure the same child behaviors that
were rated from the parent interview,
but viewed from the perspective of the
school. In addition, the scale included
questions on the child’s intellectual ability and school achievements. No interrater reliabilities could be obtained for
this rating scale, since, in the majority of
cases, the child had only one classroom
teacher who was familiar enough with
him to rate him on the characteristics of
interest. Teachers were, however, given
detailed instructions how to complete
the scale to avoid a halo effect. Teachers
also filled in the Child Behavior Questionnaire (Rutter, 1967), in the form designed for teachers, which differs only
slightly from that for parents.

The children were tested individually
by a trained tester. They were given the
Chrichton Vocabulary Scale and the
Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices
to test their verbal and nonverbal abilities, respectively. Both tests are wellestablished and have good reliability
and validity (Raven et al., 1977). In addition, the children were given the wellestablished Peabody Individual
Achievement Test (PIAT) (Dunn and
Markwardt, 1970).

Children’s height and weight were
measured by schoo! nurses.

RESULTS

The 2-year variables were submitted
to a biometric-genetic analysis (Lytton
et al., 1977) and to the simpler, classical
genetic analysis (cf. Haseman and Elston, 1970). Since the results turned out
almost identical (cf. Lytton, 1980), we

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

66 Lytton et al.

decided to analyze the 9-year variables
by the classical methods of the comparison of MZ and DZ within-pair variances, and the comparison of intra-class
correlations.

In the 2-year study, only the rating
for independence and the rate of child
speech (number of utterances per minute) showed significant genetic components. The largest portion of the variance of the other characteristics was
explained by between-families environmental effects. We attributed the meagerness of the genetic harvest to the relatively small sample, but it was perhaps
also due to the fact that the measures
were based on behavior which, at age 2,
is notoriously fluctuating and volatile,
though reliabilities between two scorers
for ratings and experimental scores were
quite satisfactory.

The results of the 9-year genetic analysis are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Our
first criterion for the presence of a significant genetic contribution to the variance of a given trait is the rough test pro
Social Biology

vided by the F ratio of MSyutnapz/
MS tunmz (Vandenberg, 1968). As a
second criterion, we present the difference between the MZ and DZ intraclass correlations (Goldsmith, 1983).
Where this is found to be significant
also, we can more confidently accept the
genetic component as “real.” To meet
the assumptions of the method, variables whose total variances for MZ and
DZ twins differed significantly were excluded from consideration. This occurred only in the case of some social
characteristics.

PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE
CHARACTERISTICS

As shown in Table 1, height and
weight have important genetic components. These results confirm expectations and confirm the validity of the
analysis. For Verbal IQ the MSytnamz
exceeds the MS,,nnapz (hence no F ratio
was calculated), and the DZ intra-class
correlation is larger than the MZ correlation. These relationships, in fact, du

they cannot be attributed to unreliability of testing at age 2, or the peculiarities
of the verbal test at age 9. The vocabulary that children have acquired therefore appears, in our sample, to be heavily dependent on environmental, and
not on genetic factors. Nonverbal IQ,
however, has a genetic component that
4s just significant (F ratio), and the prescence of genetic variance is confirmed by
‘the significant difference between the

Would yield a heritability greater than

pf the genetic analysis (cf. Goldsmith,
=1983) forms the upper boundary of the
Seritability (h? = 2 (rz — rpz). Howzever, the significant F' ratio confirms the
resence of a genetic component and
the lower DZ r could be explained by
other factors, e.g., nonadditive genetic
pvariance (cf. Loehlin, 1986).
7 The speech maturity rating shows
Si gnificant genetic variance, but by the F
test criterion alone. At age 2 it was the
2rate of speech that displayed a significant
Agenetic component; the maturity rating
did not. The genetic determination of
speech thus appears to remain stable
from age 2 to 9, if we are willing to
equate the two different measures of the
ability.

The objection may be raised that the
greater MZ similarity on teacher ratings
may be due to teachers entertaining a
stereotype about MZ twins’ likeness.
Fortunately we were able to test this hypothesis, since 10 MZ and 16 DZ pairs
were in different classrooms, and 5 MZ

Stability of Genetic Determination 67

and 6 DZ pairs in the same classrooms,
We therefore compared the differences
in the ratings of twin partners in the
same classroom with those in different
classrooms, for MZ and DZ twins, by
ANOVA. If teachers’ ratings were influenced by a stereotype of MZ likeness,
the ratings for the MZ twins in the same
classrooms should be closer to each
other than those in different classrooms.
While the ratings by the same teacher
tended to be more similar than those by
different teachers, for both MZ and DZ
twins, no significant difference between
the two classroom conditions (same/
different) emerged, nor was any interaction between classroom condition and
zygosity (MZ/DZ) significant. Indeed,
teachers’ ratings for math and written
composition showed greater differences
for MZ twin partners in the same, than
for those in different classrooms, though
the differences did not reach significance. It is clear, therefore, that the
greater similarity of teachers’ judgments
of MZ twins is not attributable to any
preconceived stereotype. As we have
demonstrated previously (Lytton,
1980), parents do not deliberately create
a more similar environment for their
own MZ twins, but rather react to their
genetic likeness.

In general, a high intra-class correlation indicates a high degree of similarity
between twin partners within the family
and, conversely, significant differences
between families. Where the correlations for both MZ and DZ groups are
significant but equal, there is no evidence for any genetic effect, and in its
absence the similarity must be due to
very similar environmental forces influencing the twin partners. This configuration occurred for three achievement tests: reading recognition, reading
comprehension, and general informa

tion. It is interesting to note that reading
and general information seem to be influenced by environmental similarities
within, and by environmental differences between families, whereas spelling shows some evidence of genetic control. This links up with the finding that
particularly in older “dyslexic” children
(where severe reading and writing difficulties are accompanied by neurological defects), defective spelling is often
more marked than reading disability (cf.
Keeney and Keeney, 1968; Vernon,
1971). Thus, our finding of a possible genetic component in spelling would lend

 

Social Biology

credibility to an organic explanation for
severe spelling disability.

SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS

We now turn to the social characteristics (Table 2), most of which were also
assessed at age 2, though at age 9 modifications were introduced. Seven variables have been omitted from the table.
Four variables were not considered because total variances differed between
MZ and DZ twins: Independence
(mother interview), Attachment (father
interview), Dominance (FI), and Cooperation (FI). Three variables have been

We will select for mention the characteristics that showed significant heritability either via two methods (see above)
or via at least two raters (mother, father
or teacher), since such repeated demonstration of a genetic component is an in
.dication of a relatively reliable finding.

Sout the home-based ratings do not. The
aladjustment scores, assigned by
Smother, father, and teacher, display

‘rdters, and in the case of the teacher
‘fating this is true via both methods.
‘sHowever, the evidence from the differences between MZ and DZ correlations

Sboth mother and teacher ratings show a

ease this finding ts confirmed by both criteria without qualification. The NeuGrotic subscore, on the other hand, shows
no genetic variance. Other indications
of heritability in the table are confined
to one method of calculating it and to
one rater and should therefore be
treated with some caution.

Which characteristics show significant and equal correlations between
twin partners for both MZ and DZ
groups, suggesting between-family environmental influences? Compliance,
rated from mother’s interview, and
Conscience, rated from both mother’s

 

Stability of Genetic Determination 69

and father’s interviews, do so. Maladjustment total and the Antisocial subscore, as rated by both mother and father, also manifest strong
within-families environmental similarities. In the case of mothers’ ratings there
is also evidence of a significant genetic
component for these characteristics, as
assessed by the F ratio. The co-action of
genetic and environmental forces in
these characteristics provides confirmatory evidence for the assumption that
both heredity and environment shape
the phenotypic expression of these dispositions. That evidence for significant
similarity of DZ twins and, therefore, of
familial environmental forces, comes
from mother and father (except for neurotic tendencies) must be seen in the
light of the fact that parents are in the
best position to see such similarity
among their twins and are themselves
chiefly responsible for creating environments for them.

GENETIC FACTORS IN CHANGES FROM
AGE 2 To 9

For parallel variables, measured at
both age 2 and age 9, we calculated
“change scores” by subtracting the 2year z-scores from the 9-year z-scores
and carried out a genetic analysis of
these change scores. This was done for
vocabulary-verbal IQ, for mother
interview-based ratings of Attachment,
Compliance, Conscience, and Independence, and for the teacher rating of
Speech. The only variables whose
growth demonstrated significant genetic
variance (by one method only) were the
Independence and Speech ratings (Table 3). Note that the Independence rating itself had a significant genetic component at age 2, and the Speech rating at
age 9. Changes over age therefore were

DISCUSSION

Fifty per cent of the physical and cognitive variables tested showed significant heritability by one or the other
method ana 22 per cent by both methods, but for the social characteristics the
corresponding figures are only 36 per
cent and 11 per cent respectively. The
analysis thus demonstrates less genetic
determination in social than in physical
and cognitive aspects of the personality.
This result is in line with findings from
many previous investigations, which
found only patchy evidence for genetic
components in personality or temperament characteristics overall (e.g., Goldsmith and Gottesman, 1981; Jensen,
1967; Matheny, 1980; Portenier, 1939;
Plomin and Rowe, 1979; Vandenberg,
1967). On the other hand, there has
been repeated evidence for a genetic
component in certain specific social
traits, such as ‘“‘sociability’’ and
“extroversion-introversion”’ (cf. Buss
and Plomin, 1975; Eaves and Eysenck,
1975; Loehlin, 1986; for a further discussion see Lytton, 1980, Chapter 9).

We have demonstrated significant
genetic variance at age 9 in replicated
form in the physical characteristics of
height and weight, in nonverbal IQ (a
cognitive variable), and in social maladjustment, particularly antisocial behavior. Mittler (1971) has reported that verbal ability may be more under
environmental control and nonverbal
ability more genetically determined.
However, in view of the consistent genetic component that our investigation
uncovered in speech competence, both
at age 2 and at age 9 (though by one
method only), it is surprising that the
ability to acquire vocabulary and define
words, assessed by both our verbal IQ
tests, should not be influenced by genetic factors. The small sample size—
unavoidable, since this was a follow-up
of an observational study—may be responsible for some instability in the
results.

How much stable genetic variance
could we detect in parallel measures at
age 2 and age 9? The measures, we
should emphasize, were parallel, not
identical. Speech was the one characteristic that showed consistent heritability,
but only if we are willing to equate the
amount of speech at age 2 with the
speech maturity rating at age 9. Inde

pendence had significant heritability at
age 2, but at age 9 the evidence for a genetic component, arising from the difference in correlations for father’s rating, is fragile. For Compliance and for
Attachment to mother significant genetic variance emerged only at age 9,
but in each case the evidence must be
treated with caution. Conscience and
Vocabulary IQ consistently failed to

S The inconsistent findings of genetic

A Dworkin et al., 1976), or the switching
A on and off of genes during development
(cf. Ho et al., 1980). However, such
claims are difficult to substantiate empirically for ordinary human characters.
The correlations between twin partners for these social characteristics were
generally higher at age 2 than at age 9,
1.e., twin similarity was greater at the
earlier age. At age 2 the components of
variance analysis showed that for most
of the social characteristics the largest
part cf the variance was explained by
differences between families of environ

mental and cultural origin. This declined somewhat by age 9, i.e., the intraclass correlations tended to be lower
(with some exceptions), particularly for
MZ twins. This finding suggests that differences between MZ twin partners
widened over the years, pethaps because their experiences in their enlarged
social environment diverged. However,
low correlations are not only due to systematic within-families differences. Indeed, Loehlin and Nichols (1976)
showed that when differences in parental treatments of the twins were quantified, such differences were not related
to personality differences among twin
partners. Low correlations will also be
due to error and noise of measurement,
and this source of variance will be inextricably confounded with systematic
treatment differences within the family.

Heritability can be assessed by different methods, and results across methods, samples, and ages are often only
patchily significant. Before accepting a
genetic component as “real,’’ one
should therefore require a replicated
demonstration of significant heritability, be it via several methods or for several ages or, best of all, across several
samples.

We have shown significant genetic
variance in replicated form at age 9 fora
few characteristics. The robust evidence
of genetic variance in children’s behavior disorders 1s perhaps the most important finding of this study. It confirms evidence from other research which has
shown genetic factors playing a role in
adult antisocial behavior (cf. Rutter and
Giller, 1983) and familial factors, which
could be both environmental and genetic, in children’s conduct disturbances
(Stewart et al., 1980). In general, attempts to replicate genetic analyses over
several samples have shown that the re

liable demonstration of genetic determination for the normal range of most social characteristics remains more
difficult than for cognitive ones.

In keeping with this limitation we
were able to detect stable genetic determination from age 2 to age 9 only in the
cognitive characteristic of speech facility, and even here genetic variance appeared in different operationalizations
of this construct at the two ages. Overall, the evidence in the literature for stability of genetic determination of social
personality characteristics is not strong.
Only certain defined personality variables in some investigations (Dworkin et
al., 1976, 1977) seem to show consistent
genetic determination over age, and this
can be more clearly demonstrated from

adolescence on than from early childhood. This may be the essential reason
why we discovered consistent heritability in only one cognitive characteristic.
