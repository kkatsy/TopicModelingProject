ABSTRACT: Data presented indicate that the sex ratio of the Navajo Tribe has shifted since
the 1940’s and now shows a preponderance of women rather than men. The reasons for this
shift, which roughly parallel a similar shift in the general population of the United States, are:
(1) a decline in maternal mortality rates; (2) an increase in male mortality rates, particularly
from accidents; and (3) greater out-migration of men than women. Some of the consequences
of the changing ratio include: increasing proportion of young widows with dependent children;
a growing desire for labor force participation on the part of women; out-marriage of Navajo
women; and, in the future, the probable isolation of elderly widows who may become the

responsibility of social welfare agencies.

The sex ratios of populations are significant for a variety of reasons; among
them are that they affect the patterns of
marriage formation and stability and the
tasks allocated to males and females. For
instance, the high male-to-female ratio in
frontier towns obviously affected the pattern of life. High rates of out-marriage of
Karluk Eskimo women have elevated the
sex ratio in that population to 155 men
per 100 women, clearly influencing the pattern of marriage and social relations for
those who remain (Taylor, 1966). The
enormous excess mortality of men in the
Soviet Union during the past fifty to sixty
years may well have altered the position
of women in that society, with a very high
proportion attaining positions that might
not otherwise have been available (Petersen, 1969).

There are numerous factors influencing
the sex ratio. There may be differential
ratios at birth depending on such factors

33

as race, socioeconomic status, and birth
order. In some populations, infanticide may
have played a significant role. Differential
migration patterns may alter the ratios
both in the donor and recipient populations. For instance, Petersen (1969, pp.
264~265) has shown that nations in Western Europe achieved sex ratios below 100
by the end of the nineteenth century,
whereas nations in Eastern Europe, from
which emigration occurred later, achieved
similar ratios by the midtwentieth century.
Clearly, migration may not be the only explanation; war and improved health care
may also be implicated.

We have already noted the impact of
excess male mortality on the Soviet Union.
Warfare has also been suggested by Ember
(1974) to be causally related to the numerical predominance of females in tribal
populations which practiced polygyny. In
the absence of warfare, however, it appears
that the sex ratio changes largely in reDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

sponse to what might be called modernization. The decreasing risk of maternal
mortality, the decline in deaths due to infectious diseases, and the increase in the
importance of man-made and degenerative
diseases all seem to favor a relatively
greater reduction of female than male mortality (Omran, 1971; Cowgill and Holmes,
1972).

In Figure 1 we have displayed curves
representing the number of males per 1,000
females in five-year age groups in a variety
of nations (United Nations, 1973). It is
clear that in the industrially more advanced nations women tend to outnumber
men at all ages beyond childhood, whereas
in less advanced nations, men outnumber
women in the middle adult years. In India’s
Hindu population (curve not shown), the

1100

numerical predominence of males has been
attributed to two factors: (1) the provision of more adequate medical care to
young males as opposed to young females;
and (2) high maternal mortality (Gopalan
and Naidu, 1972).

In the United States, where the risks of
death from infectious disease, maternal
mortality, and warfare have not been high
in recent years, the sex ratio curve shows
a decrease in the number of males per
1,000 females with increasing age. This decrease is generally attributed to the higher
death rate for males at all ages, particularly from traumatic causes and chronic
diseases. The same general pattern is true
for Japan, save for the dip in the curve at
age 45-55. This dip presumably reflects the
impact of World War II on that cohort of

Puerto Rico and Colombia each show a
curve with an upturn in the middle adult
years( thirties and early forties) and a
downward trend in late middle age. This
curve represents an inc:ease in the proportion of adult males largely as a result
of high maternal mortality among adult
women who had experienced their childbearing years at a time when medical ser= vices may not have been as developed as
‘\ they are at present.
We do not pretend that this discussion is
9 by any means exhaustive. We have not

in sex ratios between so-called developed
and underdeveloped nations.

It is also important to point out that
populations within nations clearly differ
in their sex ratios. In Figure 2 we have
displayed curves for the urban and rural
populations of the United States and Puerto
Rico. It is clear that the urban populations
have a similar configuration, showing an
increasing proportion of women with increasing age. The rural U.S. population
shows an upswing in males in the adult
years, but, it is never high enough to produce a predominance of males. The rural
Puerto Rican population shows a clear predominance of males starting in the midforties and continuing until old age when
women begin to predominate.

The two urban curves may represent the
improvement of maternity services to urban
women as opposed to those available in
rural areas as well as reduced rates of mortality resulting from lower birth rates. The
difference between the two rural curves
may represent both the earlier improvement of U.S. rural health services as opposed to those in Puerto Rico as well as a

lower birth rate in the rural United States.
In addition, it is possible that the urbanrural differences in each country may be
accounted for by differential migration of
women rather than men, although this does
not appear to be the most significant reason.

American Indian populations have clearly been influenced differentially by the
various factors mentioned above. Sex ratios
vary from 81 males per 100 females among
the Yabarana in Venezuela and Caingang
in Brazil to 155 for the Karluk Eskimos in
Alaska and 180 for the Piapoco in Venezuela (Salzano, 1972, pp. 240-241). Eastern Pueblos in New Mexico have had ratios
that have varied over the past several hundred years depending on a number of forces
acting upon them. In 1798, at a time of
high male mortality in warfare, the ratio
was 80 males to 100 females; in 1890 when
warfare had ceased but when health conditions were very poor and maternal mortality high, the ratio was 126; and in 1970
when health conditions had improved dramatically and male emigration may have
increased the ratio was 94. (Witt, 1969;
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973; see also
Harvey, 1967). In this paper we will describe in some detail the changing sex ratios
among the Navajo Indians, explore some
of the reasons for the patterns that are
emerging, and speculate on what some of
the consequences may be. We will suggest
that the patterns are related primarily to
“modernization” and differential migration
of men and women.

NAVAJO POPULATION

The Navajo are the largest tribe in
North America, with a population estimated at 131,000 (plus or minus 10 per
cent) in 1972. In previous publications we
have traced the tribe’s growth and have
suggested that it is undergoing a demographic transition much like that experi
Social Biology

enced by many developing nations (Kunitz,
1974a,b). Their land base was expanded
five-fold from the time the Navajos were
first placed on a reservation of about 3.3
million acres. We have attributed their
continued high birth rate to the fact that
land acquisition allowed the continuing
isolation of many families and low level of
academic attainment of many individuals,
the pastoral subsistence economy to remain
viable, and large families to remain adaptive.

Since the 1930’s, when overgrazing led
to a forced reduction in the amount of livestock allowed on the reservation, Navajos
have moved increasingly into wage work.
In addition, improved health care has lowered the infant and maternal mortality
rates and has been followed by a gradual
decline in the birth rate from perhaps 45
per 1,000 to 30 or 35 per 1,000 population
at present. Moreover, we have suggested
that the decline in the birth rate has been
a result of a decline in childbearing by
women in their thirties and above rather
than of a postponement or reduction of
childbearing by women in their late teens
and twenties. Because birth rates are still
high (though slowly being reduced) while
infant mortality has declined dramatically,
the population has continued to grow rapidly in recent years, much as has happened
in developing nations.

These changes have been accompanied
by changes in the ratio of males to females
over the course of the century. In Figure
3, we have displayed curves of males per
1,000 females (all ages) from the beginning of the century to the present for the
Navajo, for all indians, and for the general
U.S. population. In each case it is evident
that the decades of the 1940’s and 1950’s
were the time when females began to outnumber males in all three populations.
Writing of this period, Johnston (1966,
p. 175) has said: “It can be concluded that

 
Vol. 23, No. l

Navajo mortality .. . has declined in the
period from 1945 to 1955. This decline is
especially noteworthy since 1950 and is
stronger in the female segment of the population than in the male.” It is likely that
the major impact on female mortality was
made by improvements in maternal mortality, more specifically in better delivery
services rather than fewer pregnancies at
risk since the birth rate had not changed
appreciably during that period.

total American Indian (U.S. and Alaska

based on data from the 1970 U.S. census

Navajo population curve is based on estimates provided by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs (U.S. Department of the Interior,

ilar to the rural Puerto Rican population;
and (3) the Navajo reservation population
has a curve that is even more accentuated
in the imbalance of males in the sixties and
above.

In Table 1 we have presented maternal
mortality rates for American Indians for
selected years between 1940 and 1970. It
is clear that the rate has dropped rapidly
during that period, although for the Navajo it is still somewhat higher than for
all Indians. In 1972-73, it was 60 per
100,000 live births, judging by tabulations
we have been able to make from data provided by the Indian Health Service (Kunitz, 19746, Slocumb and Kunitz, ms.).
By using these figures and making some

simplifying assumptions, we may estimate
the number of Navajo maternal deaths between 1935 and 1970.

The Navajo population in 1935 is estimated to have been about 40,000. Thirtyfive years later it is estimated to have been
130,000. The midpoint average is 85,000.
Assuming the birth rate in 1936 as 45 per
1,000 population and in 1970 as 35 per
1,000, the midpoint average is 40 per 1,000.
Assuming the 1935 maternal mortality to
have been about 1,000 per 100,000 live
births, the midpoint is about 500 per
100,000 live births. Thus, the number of
Navajo births during this period is about
119,000 and the number of maternal deaths
is estimated to have been about 600. In itself, this difference is not large enough to
account for the difference in population
between men and women, which in 1972
was estimated to be 3,364.

Zet al., 1970). Assuming the rate to have

“z assumption that the death rate was 100 per
© 100,000 and the ratio of male to female
deaths was stable at 3:1), the midpoint
average is 117 per 100,000. Thus, between
1935 and 1970, the total number of men
-8who died in accidents was about 1,740. The
Snumber of female deaths over the same
Speriod would have been about 580. The
A excess of male deaths is therefore approximately 1,160 over this 35-year period.
More importantly, the death rate has been
rising and would therefore be of increasing
importance in influencing the number of
adult men at the present time.

Even accidents, however, cannot explain
the difference in numbers of men and
women at present. A large part of the difference would appear to be explained by
out-migration of single men. For example,
between 1952 and 1960, 1,209 single men
left the reservation as part of a Bureau of

h

Indian Affairs relocation program. In contrast, 107 single women and 555 family
units left over the same period (Young,
1961, p. 236). About 35 per cent returned
to the reservation within a short period. In
his more recent study of Navajo relocatees
in Denver, Graves (1970) found that about
two-thirds returned to the reservation within a ten-year period.

Despite this high return rate, the evidence would seem to indicate that a much
higher number of single males than single
females migrate, and we infer from the agesex structure that a significantly larger
number stay away more or less permanently, at least permanently enough to be
lost to the Navajo population register.
Thus, while the data do not permit a truly
accurate assessment of the relative weights
to be assigned to the various factors discussed above, it appears that maternal mortality decline has led to increased survival
of women at the same time that migration
and increasing mortality are leading to a
relative diminution in the number of men.

We have suggested throughout that the
Navajo population is undergoing considerable change and that the sex ratio is not
stable over time. The preponderance of
men over women in the age groups 65 and
above bears this out. The people in this
older age group went through their young
adult years at a time when migration rates
and accident death rates were lower and
when maternal mortality was higher than
at present. Thus, that part of the sex ratio

curve represents what might be considered
a residual population, that is, a population
that experienced the risks attendant upon
migration, accidents, and childbirth at a
time when they were substantially different
than they are at present. They are, in effect, a cohort left over from an earlier
period, and we would expect that as they
age and die the structure of the entire population will change to one in which females
outnumber males at all ages beyond childhood. Thus, the sex-ratio curve is likely
to shift within the next twenty years to one
which approximates in configuration that
of the general rural U.S. population.

If we compare the Navajo reservation
population to the rural populations of CoJombia, Puerto Rico, and the United States
as shown in Figure 5, we note that the con

figuration of the curve is not so much a
function of rurality as it is of what might
be called “modernization.” The rural Colombian population shows a predominance

population shows an upswing in the adult
years which never achieves a predominance
of males.

It is perhaps reasonable to suggest that
the changing configuration of these curves
from Colombia at one extreme to the rural
United States on the other is one index of
an increasing rural standard of living, beginning at different points in time, at least
as manifested by improved health services
and changing patterns of mortality. That

is, the improvements may have occurred
first for the general rural U.S. population,
next for the Navajo, then Puerto Rico, and
hardly at all in Colombia. Clearly, differences in migration must be reflected here
as well. If these curves are not stable over
time and if they shift in response to changing economic and social conditions as well
as in response to improved medical services, then we would expect that the Navajo population will increasingly resemble
the general rural United States population
in coming years.

We suggested earlier that the sex ratio
had major implications for marital patterns
and stability. In Table 3 we have displayed

data concerning marriages for reservation
residents above the age of 14 and for all
tribal members whether on or off reservation. The source is the U.S. census which,
as we have already noted, seems to have
significantly underenumerated the reservation population. The data are consistent
with our expectations, however. First, of
those who are married, about 5 per cent
more women than men are married out of

owed, and divorced (see also Witherspoon,
1975, p. 115).

In regard to out-marriage, there is virtually no information on what becomes of
these couples. It is the general impression
of the authors that it is well-educated Navajo women who tend to marry non-Indians
and that they ultimately move away from
the reservation. We must emphasize, however, that this is only an impression.

The higher proportion of widows than
widowers is not surprising given the sex
ratios described above. What is less immediately obvious, however, is the relative
ages of widows and widowers. In Table 4

we have displayed the distribution of people in each category by age and sex.

It is clear that the proportions of men
and women who are single, married, and
divorced do not differ substantially above
and below the age of 60. Widows and widowers do differ significantly, however. Almost 26 per cent of the widowers are
below the age of 60, whereas 42 per cent
of the widows are below that age. Clearly,
the high death rate of relatively young
Navajo men has a considerable impact,
especially since childbearing begins at an
early age and many of their widows are
likely to have children who are themselves
relatively young and not yet independent.

We suggested previously that the sex
ratio will influence to some degree the occupational roles available to men and

women, The employment situation on the
Navajo Reservation is at least as bad as
any place in the United States, with perhaps 60 per cent unemployed. In a manpower survey in 1968, an expanded definition of “Jabor force” was used to take this
into account (Navajo Tribe, 1968). In
national employment and unemployment
figures, an individual is counted as within
the labor force if he or she has been actively seeking work in a defined period of
time prior to the interview. Because employment is so scarce on the reservation,
it was thought that most Navajos would
not have been actively seeking work. Thus,
people were counted as within the labor
force if they answered affirmatively the
question of whether they would take a job
if one were available. This liberalized definition makes comparisons with national
figures imprecise. Nonetheless, Table 5 provides some suggestive data.

Clearly, Navajo women are much more
likely to be considered part of the labor
force than are women in the larger US.
population, The most important reason no
doubt has to do with the general poverty
on the reservation and the fact that many
women would take a job out of necessity
whereas women in the general population
may not feel so constrained to accept a job
were one available. Nonetheless, it seems

reasonable to suppose that a contributing
factor to the generally higher proportions
among Navajo women at all ages is the fact
that there is a lower sex ratio among Navajos in the productive years (i.e., there
are fewer men per 100 women among Navajos than among the general U.S. population) and hence a somewhat higher proportion of Navajo women are likely to be
the sole or primary supporters of their
families and are therefore more interested
in working.

DISCUSSION

We have said that sex ratios are important in influencing patterns of marriage.
Other factors are important as well, of
course. Navajo marriage has been said to
be traditionally unstable (Leighton and
Kluckhohn, 1948, p. 96; Kluckhahn, 1962,
p. 100). There is some evidence that stability is increasing as the extended family
loses its importance and husbands and
wives are forced to invest more in their relationship (Levy and Kunitz, 1974, p. 114;
Shepardson and Hammond, 1970, p. 199).
The same has been said to be the case for
Hopi marriages, which have also traditionally been unstable (Nagata, 1970).

In addition to the pattern of serial
monogamy said to be common in the past,
polygyny was also not uncommon, the preferred form being sororal polygyny. Under
the influence of the dominant society, and
also as a result of economic forces which
make it difficult any longer for a man to
support more than one wife, this pattern
is breaking down. Ironically, polygyny was
more common at a time when men outnumbered women than it is now when women
outnumber men and may have been a carryover from the time when Navajos engaged
in raiding and warfare with consequent
high male mortality.

Thus, both the increasing stability of
marriage and the decline in polygyny would

appear to work to decrease the proportion
of Navajo women who are able to find Navajo husbands. It has been suggested
(Hamamsy, 1957) that those Navajo
women who do marry will suffer a decline
in their relative status in the family in contrast to what it was in the past, largely
as a result of the increasing involvement
of men in the wage economy. But what of
those women who do not marry at all or
who are widowed relatively young? It
would appear that until the high mortality
of young men declines, matrifocal families
with dependent children will be a small but
significant problem for social service programs. It is also possible that until contraceptives become more effectively used there
will continue to be high numbers of pregnancies among unmarried and divorced
women (Slocumb et al., 1975). It seems
reasonable to suppose that many young
women will begin to pursue careers of one
sort or another as an alternative to marriage, much as has happened in some segments of the larger society. Finally, marriage to non-Navajo men will continue to
increase in the future.

An additional and potentially serious
problem will be the status of elderly widows. At present, men outnumber women in
the older age groups. As these elderly cohorts die, however, the sex ratio in these
age groups will shift to favor women over
men, much as has happened elsewhere.
Moreover, as the age structure shifts in
response to declining fertility rates to produce an increasing proportion of the elderly, these individuals will come to represent
a larger proportion of the population than
they do at present (Coale, 1956). If at the
same time family structure shifts increasingly so as to favor neolocal rather than
extended forms of organization, it may fall
to welfare agencies to become increasingly
concerned with this segment of the population (Levy, 1967).

There are at least two possibilities re
Changing Sex Ratio of the Navajo

garding the change in sex ratio over the
next generation or so. The first is that
mortality and migration rates of young
adult men will remain excessively high.
Coupled with expected higher age-specific
mortality rates among men than women
above the age of 60 or so, this possibility
suggests that the sex ratio curve will within
a generation roughly parallel the curve for
rural America generally (see Figure 5) but
will be lower at all ages beyond childhood.
The second possibility is that male mortality and migration will decline in the young
adult years, in which case the curve will
be more nearly identical to that for rural
America.

It appears to us that the first possibility
is the most likely, because there does not
seem to be much chance that employment
opportunities on reservation will increase
sufficiently to stem the disproportionate
out-migration of males. Moreover, high
mortality rates in this group result primarily from accidents, and that phenomenon is as yet so porly understood, its control so ineffective, and interest in its prevention so lacking that there seems small
hope that the rates will decline dramatically
in the near future.

It would appear, then, that under the
influence of changing economic, social,
and health conditions, the sex ratio of the
Navajo tribe has shifted to favor a higher
proportion of women than men. Excess
male mortality and migration have been
somewhat more significant as contributing
factors than decreasing maternal mortality.
The shift is not yet completed, and the
ratio will become even lower in the future
as the present generation above the age of
60 dies and is replaced by one consisting of
a decreasing male/female ratio. Though
this may lead to social and economic difficulties for those women who are forced to
remain or become isolated, it may also lead
many into careers which will themselves
bring satisfaction.
