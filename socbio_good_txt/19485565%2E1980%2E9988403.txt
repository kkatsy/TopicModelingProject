ABSTRACT: During the 1800’s, the population of Ireland underwent a rapid increase and subsequent decrease in population size. The effects of this change upon population structure were assessed using a simulation of the isolation by distance model and comparing the results to those obtained assuming constant population size. These results indicate that changes in within-group
genetic similarity (kinship) brought about by a rapid increase in population size are cancelled by the
effects of a rapid decrease in population size. Parameters of the isolation by distance model are
hardly affected by population size changes. Tinese results suggest that violation of the assumption of
constant population size for population structure models may not be that serious when population

size changes rapidly and in both directions.

The study of human population structure allows the assessment of the effects of
cultural behavior upon gene and genotype
distributions in a population. Essentially,
a population’s structure refers to the mating probabilities of its members, and the
subsequent effects on genotype distributions. Factors influencing this structure include mating preferences and/or avoidances, population size and distribution,
and barriers to gene flow, which may be
geographic, topographic, and social
(Yasuda and Morton, 1967; CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971).

The basic measure of population structure is the coefficient of kinship, 9,,,
defined by Malécot (1969) as the probability that two random alleles from the same
locus, one from individual i and one from
individual j, are identical due to descent
from one or more common ancestors. The
coefficient of kinship is a generalization of
Wright’s inbreeding coefficient (F), where
i andj are mates. Kinship as defined here
can be estimated from a wide variety of

data, such as pedigrees, gene frequencies,
surnames, migration matrices, and metrics (Morton et al., 1971; Morton, 19735),
for either individuals or samples.

A commonly used model of human
population structure is isolation by distance, which proceeds from the basic assumption.that most people choose mates
from nearby and fewer choose mates from
further away. This model describes kinship (¢) as a negative exponential function
of the geographic distance between populations (d), such that

o(d) = ae” (1)
(Yasuda and Morton, 1967), where a and
b are known as the Malécot parameters.
The parameter a is an estimate of the
mean within-group kinship (4,,), and bisa
measure of the rate of decrease in kinship
with distance. The parameter b reflects
the balance between short range gene flow
and linear systematic forces acting upon
the entire array of populations. It is gener

ally assumed that long range migration
from a homogeneous external population
is the major component of this systematic
force (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971).

As with all models of population
genetics, the isolation by distance model
requires certain assumptions to be made
which might not be appropriate for human
populations (Fix, 1979). These assumptions include estimation of kinship at equilibrium and constancy of population size
and migration rates over time. Computer
simulation can be of service here by allowing testing of the effects of violating these
assumptions. Simulation has been used in
the analysis of population structure for estimating kinship (Morton, 1973c), evaluation of the internal consistency of data
(Morton, et al., 1973), determining the
validity of approximation models (Imaizumi et al., 1970; Harris and Morton,
1973), and assessing the effects of changing demographic parameters (Relethford,
1981).

The purpose of this paper is to use a
simulation model to assess the effects of
changing population size upon the genetic
structure of western Ireland. Specifically,
the changes in estimates of the isolation by
distance parameters will be investigated to
determine the effects which could result
from the rapid increase and subsequent
decrease in the population size of Ireland
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Since all factors other than population size are held constant, these simulations are not to be taken as exact
representations of the population structure of Ireland over time, but rather are
used to assess the effects of rapidly changing population size such as occurred in Ireland.

DEMOGRAHIC HISTORY

Population size for the Republic of Ireland from 1687 to 1936 is shown in Figure

sources. Prior to 1821, the figures are
Connell’s (1950) estimates based on the
number of houses and the average number
of people per house as obtained from parish records. After 1821, the figures are
from national censuses which began in
that year (Central Statistics Office, 1971).
The periods of increase and decrease in
Figure 1 both resemble J-shaped curves in
that exponential increase (up to 1841) is
followed by exponential decrease. While
an S-shaped (logistic) curve is often more
appropriate to describe human population
growth, the J-shaped curve has been observed in nonindustrial populations where
a sudden epidemic and/or famine has occured (Hardesty, 1977), precisely the situation in Ireland.

The rapid population growth after 1780
is seen as resulting from the introduction
of the potato and the subsequent effects
on patterns of marriage and land inheritance. According to Connell (1950), the introduction of the potato provided a mechanism for population growth after 1780 by
introducing a food resource that could be
grown on a fraction of the land required by
other crops, thus allowing more and larger
families with little increase in the total
land required. Increased efficiency of the

land allowed subdivision of a family’s land
into numerous parcels, preferably one for
each marriageable son. Since land was a
prerequisite for marriage, the increased
availability of land allowed an increase in
the marriage rate and hence in the birth
rate and population size. The increased
population size also encouraged further
subdivision in a cyclical manner which accelerated after the introduction of the potato (Connell, 1950; Brody, 1973). Additional aspects of this population growth
and alternative explanations of associated
cultural change are given by Drake (1963)
and Lee (1968).

Population size decreased rapidly
during the 1840’s concurrent with the
Great Famine (1846-51) when the bulk of
the potato crop was destroyed. While the
Famine was not the first occurrence of the
potato blight in Ireland, it was the most
devastating in that it occurred for five consecutive years during which time the Irish
received little aid from their English
landlords. Approximately one million
people emigrated and over one and a half
million died (Woodham-Smith, 1962).
The Famine was not, however, the sole
cause of population decline. Population
growth was already decreasing prior to the
Famine, due to the fact that subdivision of
land had reached the point where the
average land holding was less than that
minimally required for existence. As a response to this situation, emigration and an
increase in the average age at marriage
had begun prior to the Famine. After the
Famine, consolidation of land, emigration, and postponed marriage continued
acting to lower population size. Additional aspects of this period in Irish demographic history may be found in Brody
(1973) and Kennedy (1973).

The major aspect of Irish demographic
history investigated in this study is the
over twofold growth in population size in
less than a century, followed by an almost

threefold decrease in as much time. For
applications of models of population
structure, such a demographic history obviously violates the assumption of constant population size through time, and
simulation is used to assess the effects of
this violation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Simulation of the isolation by distance
model requires certain migration parameters which have been taken from a study of
Irish population structure using anthropometric data collected in the 1930’s (Relethford, 1980b; Relethford et al., 1980,
1981; Relethford et al., ms.; Lees and Relethford, 1981). The data used in these
studies consist of 14 anthropometric
measures taken on adult males and adult
females from 12 towns in Western Ireland
between 1934 and 1936 and are a subset of
the material originally collected by the
Harvard Anthropological Survey of Ireland (Hooton and Dupertuis, 1955). Since
the studies cited above have shown the female sample to provide a better fit to the
isolation by distance model, that sample
will be used here for the derivation of the
simulation parameters.

The method of anthropometric bioassay described by Relethford (1980a) was
used, and the Malécot parameters were
estimated as a = 0.0077 and b =0.0308
(Relethford et al., 1981). These values,
along with certain demographic parameters, can be used to determine the parameters needed to describe a reduction of a
population’s structure into a onedimensional circular stepping-stone
model. Here, all populations are of equal
size and are distributed evenly along a circle such that each population exchanges
genes with two adjacent neighbors. This
model has been found to provide a good
approximation of an infinite onedimensional model, which, for finite dis

tances, is appropriate even when actual
migration is multidimensional (Imaizumi
et al., 1970; Morton, et al., 1973). In the
present study, twenty populations arranged in a circular structure were chosen
for simulation.

For a one-dimensional model, such as
described above, the Malécot parametera
is expressed in terms of the effective population size, N_, and the effective migration
rate, m,, that is,

a=1/(1+4Nm,), (2)

where the effective migration rate is composed of the stepping-stone migration rate
between adjacent populations, k, and
long-range migration from outside the region of analysis is acting upon the entire
array of populations, m. This relationship
is

m,= Vm(m + 2k). (3)
A final parameter of the one-dimensional
stepping-stone model is the distance D between any two adjacent populations,
which is

D = V2mikib, (4)

where b is the Malécot parameter (Morton, 1973a). The decomposition of the
Malécot parameters into these components (k, m, D) allows simulation of an
ideal referent population. While effective
population size and effective migration
are used to estimate kinship, they are generally less than the evolutionary population size and migration rate, which depend
on local migration (Morton, 1973c).

For the present study, I obtained values
of N. and m from demographic data and
used these along with the isolation-bydistance parameters to estimate steppingstone migration as

Social Biology

k = {[(1 — a)/4aN 2 — m}/2m, (5)

and stepping-stone distance (D) was computed from Equation (4). For each town,
the effective population size was computed using Crow and Kimura’s (1970)
formula, which takes into account variance in fertility. The value of N_ for simulation was taken as the harmonic mean of
these values (Relethford, 19805). An estimate of m was obtained from the proportion of immigrants into the area of study
based on census data. Details of this estimation may be found in Relethford
(1980b). These procedures resulted in estimates of N_ = 262 andm = 0.041. Use of
Equations (4) and (5) gave estimates of k
= 0.164 and D = 23 km. These estimates
are similar to those obtained in other
studies of human population structure, especially Swiss Alpine isolates (Morton,
1977).

Simulation of the isolation by distance
model is accomplished using an iterative
process which computes the expected kinship between two populations based on
the effective population size, N_, the rate
of long-range migration, , the number of
generations, f, and the exchange matrix of
local stepping-stone migration, P. The
elements of the exchange matrix are computed from the stepping-stone migration
rate k, such that

P; =1-k, (6)
P= k/2 for adjacent populations,
P=

, = O for non-adjacent populations.

For simulation of an ideal circular structure, the exchange matrix is symmetric (P,
= P.) (Imaizumi et al., 1970; Morton,
1973c). In the present study, each population exchanges k/2 = 16.4/2 = 8.2 per
cent of its genes with both adjacent
neighbors.

The kinship between populations i and

go = (empl DD PPy ba

k

(5)where summation is over all n populations (Imaizumi et al., 1970). If all of the
parameters remain constant through time,
the average within-group kinship (¢,)
will increase asymptotically to approach
equilibrium. Other variants of simulation
of a migration matrix may be found in
Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1968),
Hiorns et al. (1969), and Smith (1969).

When the values of N., m, and k are
held constant, the above model allows
comparison with observed values of kinship to determine if the reduction to a circular stepping-stone model is appropriate
(Morton et al., 1973). Also, this model
provides a reference with which to assess
the effects of changing population size.
These effects were assessed in the present
study by changing the value of N_ at each
generation in proportion to the change in
population size in Ireland between 1687
and 1936. Values of N, were obtained by
using the rates of growth for pre- and postFamine growth from Figure 1 and extrapolating back from an effective population
size of 262 in 1936 (Relethford, 1980b).
This method assumes that changes in population size were proportional throughout
Ireland. Based on limited data by counties
(Department of Industry and Commerce,
1938), such an assumption seems reasonable.

To relate the simulation model to actual dates, average generation length must
be known. A generation length of 25 years
was taken as an approximate average of
age at marriage prior to and after: the

 

Changing Population Size 57

Famine (Connell, 1950; Kennedy, 1973).
Using generations of 25 years each, a maximum effective population size of 689 was
predicted for 1836 and a minimum of 165
for 1661. I chose 50 generations as the total duration for simulation. By letting the
last generation occur in 1936, I found the
maximum population size was reached in
the 46th generation and the minimum in
the 39th generation. Generations 1
through 38 were assumed to have a constant effective population size of 165.
While constancy in population size prior
to 1661 (Generation 39) seems a reasonable assumption in light of Ireland’s demographic history, the effects of choosing
shorter simulation durations will be addressed below.

In addition to a consideration of the effect of changing population size on withingroup kinship, the effects on estimates of
the Malécot parameters were also assessed. At each generation, the isolation
by distance parameters were estimated using a logarithmic transformation of Equation (1), such that

In (b) = In(a) — bd, (8)

where the geographic distance d is taken
as the perimeter distance in kilometers
around the circular exchange network.
Given D = 23 km. above, populations are
separated atd = 23 km., 46 km., 69 km.,
and so forth.

RESULTS |

The changes in mean within-group kinship with time are shown in Figure 2,
where Run 1 assumes constant effective
population size and Run 2 assumes changing population size. Run 1 shows the typical asymptotic curve with a rapid increase
in within-group kinship, which then decelerates to slowly converge on an equilib

rium state. After 50 generations the mean
within-group kinship is 0.0065, close to
that predicted from anthropometric bioassay (0.0077). This finding may seem obvious, since the migration parameters were
estimated from the latter value; but the
simulation illustrates that the observed
population structure can be represented
adequately by a simple linear model (Morton et al., 1973). A value of 6 = 0.0050 is
reached by the 10th generation (250
years), showing a rapid approach to an
equilibrium state.

Simulation Run 2 shows the effect of
changing population size. Prior to the 39th
generation (1661), this curve has higher
values of mean within-group kinship than
does Run 1, a finding which is expected
due to the lower initial population size of
Run 2 (N, = 165) compared to Run 1 (N,
= 262). After the 39th generation, the
mean within-group kinship decreases rapidly as a consequence of the rapid increase
in population size. This decrease continues past the generation of maximum
population size (t = 46) to reach a maximum in the 48th generation. After the
46th generation (1836), the population
size was decreasing, acting to counter the
previous decrease in kinship. As a result,
the mean within-group kinship begins to

Social Biology

increase again. After 50 generations of
simulation, the mean within-group kinship is 0.0059, which is similar to that expected with constant effective population
size. It is clear from Figure 2 that the two
curves would converge in only a few additional generations. Also, changes in kinship lag changes in population size for Run
2. The degree of this lag is dependent
upon the amount of accumulated kinship,
migration rates, and the degree of change
in population size.

The Malécot parameters were estimated for both simulations. After 50
generations, a = 0.0071 and b = 0.0305
for Run 1, anda = 0.0074 and b = 0.0281
for Run 2. That the parameters for Run 1
are similar to those obtained from anthopometric bioassay is expected, since the
latter were used to model the simulation.
What is interesting, however, are the
values of the Malécot parameters for Run
2, which show little effect of changing population size.

Changes in the Malécot parameter b
with time are shown for both runs in Figure 3. For both runs, b increases rapidly at
first since insufficient time has elapsed for
intermigration among populations to
lower the rate of distance decay. After the
seventh generation, b decreases rapidly to

approach an equilibrium state. Of particular interest 1s the fact that both runs are essentially identical. The only noticeable effects of changing population size are a
slightly larger maximum value of b for
Run 2 (due to an initially smaller value of
N_), and a slight reduction in b after the
39th generation for Run 2. Changes in the
Malécot parameter a, which are not
shown, show the same pattern. This finding is expected since a is dependent upon
the value of 5 when the regression model
in Equation (8) is used.

The above simulations have several implications for estimation of kinship under
conditions of rapidly changing population
size. First, as Shown in Figure 2, a rapid increase and subsequent decrease in population size has little effect on mean withingroup kinship after the population change
has occurred. Second, estimation of the
Malécot parameters is hardly affected by
changes in population size. This lack of
change is expected if changes in population size occurred equally throughout the
region, acting to increase or decrease
values of kinship equally across the entire
array of populations. Changes in the Malécot parameter b with time regardless of
population size change suggest caution for
studies which focus on estimation of b
across time and subsequently make inferences about changes in stepping-stone
migration (e.g., Mielke et al., 1976). The
present study suggests that a decrease in
the Malécot parameter b with time could
be due to the approach to equilibrium as
well as to changes in stepping-stone migration. Future research will be directed toward the assessment and partitioning of
these effects.

A major assumption of the simulations
used here is that population size was constant up to the period of population
change. This is a critical assumption, since
it is apparent from Figure 2 that the two
curves converge near the 50th generation

Changing Population Size 59

because of a greater initial population size
for Run 2 combined with a decrease in kinship for that run after the 39th generation.
The assumption of a constant effective
population size prior to the 1700’s is not
unreasonable, but it is difficult to test,
given the scarcity of adequate demographic data. An alternative approach is
to start the simulation of population structure at the beginning of population change
and to assume no prior accumulation of
kinship. Such a simulation provides an
idea of the effects of the most extreme
case, where both runs start in the recent
past. The results of both runs are shown in
Figure 4, where generation t = 0 1s the
year 1661 and generation t = 111s the year
1936.

As in Figure 2, Run 2 shows an initial
increase over Run 1 because of a smaller
initia] population size. This increase, however, is soon countered by the increase in
population size for Run 2, and a decrease
in kinship takes place due to continued
population growth. Kinship increases
again after population size decreases. In
the final generation, the mean withingroup kinship for Run 1 is 0.0052 and is
0.0036 for Run 2. While this difference is
greater than that shown in the simulation
of Figure 2, it is still small relative to the
range of estimates in within-group kinship

often obtained in any one study using different methods of bioassay. In sum, the effects of a rapid increase and subsequent
decrease in population size are small,
which suggests that kinship estimated under the assumption of constant population
size provides a slight overestimate of actual kinship. The degree of this overesttmation depends upon what point in time
the simulation begins.

The estimates of the Malécot parameter b for the 11 generation run behave in
the same manner as the 50 generation run,
giving similar values for Run 1 (6 =
0.0606) and Run 2 (6 = 0.0580). While
these values are similar, they both overestimate the expected value of b at equilibrium (6 = 0.0308). Thus, while changing
population size has little effect on the estimation of b, the point in time at which simulation begins does affect this estimate. A
high value of b in any actual study of population structure might reflect the fact that
insufficient time has elapsed rather than a
high degree of actual isolation.

The results and conclusions presented
above are based on an extremely simple
simulation model where only one parameter is altered. In theory, other parameters,
such as changing migration rates, generation lengths, and age-sex distributions,
could be incorporated. For western Ireland, these data are not available to allow
direct incorporation, although general
trends can be noted and used with the
present study to allow certain inferences
to be made. For example, the ethnographic literature suggests increased migration among communities to have occurred due to improvements in
transportation and the effect of emigra

tion reducing the number of available
mates within a given region (Connell,
1962). In terms of population structure,
this change would correspond with an increase in the stepping-stone migration
rate (k) with time. Such a change would
act to inflate the increase and decrease of
within-group kinship shown in Figure 2.
Such a change would also apply to an increase in the long-range migration rate
(m) with time. Actual data are needed ‘to
adequately describe the evolution of population structure for any specific area. As
noted earlier, this study is not an attempt
to replicate the actual genetic structure of
western Ireland, but rather to assess what
types of changes could occur.

In general, the assumption of constant
population size appears to be the most
critical assumption made for the isolation
by distance model. In terms of the present
study, dramatic changes in population size
have little effect on the final observed
parameters of population structure when
such change is rapid and in both directions. Additional research is needed to
assess the effects of other patterns of population size change which have been observed for human populations.
