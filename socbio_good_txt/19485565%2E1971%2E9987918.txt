A Note on Changes in Age at Marriage of Females
and Their Effect on the Birth Rate in India

Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967),

‘Basavarajappa (1968), and Talwar (1967)

have discussed in the pages of this journal,
the effect of a rise in the age at marriage
of the Indian females on the birth rate in
India. The object of this note is to lend
support to Basavarajappa’s contention that
the decrease in the Indian birth rate will
not be appreciable if the minimum age at
marriage of the females is raised to twenty
years. A new methodology is suggested
here which is flexible enough to allow for
relaxing some of the stronger conditions
assumed by Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967). The effect on the Indian female birth rate is worked out under the
following assumptions:

1. The Indian female population is stable
(quasi-stable).

2. The Indian female population will remain
stable (quasi-stable) after the minimum
age at marriage is raised to twenty years.

3. Marriage is universa).

4, Every female (when the minimum age at
marriage is raised to twenty years) will be
able to find a spouse.

5. All births are legitimate (i.e., within wedlock).

6. The age specific marital birth rates for the
age groups 20-24, 25-29, ..., 40-44 will
remain the same as before while there will
be no births in the age group 15-19.

7. The sex ratio at birth is 105 male births to
100 female births.

8. There is no mortality differential with respect to marital status.

9. Mortality level remains the same for the
population during the period under consideration.

Assumptions 3 through 9 can be found
in Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967).
Assumption 1 is well known and has been
employed by several researchers. Assumption 2 may seem to be a little unrealistic.
In view of the fact that corresponding to
any age distribution, one can find a stable
population, a result demonstrated by Bourgeois-Pichat (1958), this assumption can
be profitably used to examine the implications of a certain course of action. Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967) assume that
remarriages of widows and divorcees will
not become common during the period
under study. In the methodology developed
here, there is no way to take care of this
assumption. Hence, the per cent reduction
in the birth rate computed by the technique
suggested here is likely to be a little higher
than the one they estimated. To compensate
for this weak point of the methodology, we
shall work with both age-specific marital
birth rates and age-specific birth rates, Assumption 9 can be relaxed to incorporate
the gains in expectation of life by the daughter generation over the mother generation,
by employing the Ryder (1959) correction.
But for the purposes of this note, Condition
9 will not be relaxed. Also, it may be noted
that time will be measured in “‘generations.”

METHODOLOGY
In a stable population, we have
R, = exp (rT) (1)

where R, is the net reproduction rate, r
the intrinsic rate of natural increase, and T

the length of generation. We confine our
attention to the female population. Keyfitz (1968¢) has demonstrated relations between the proportional changes in two of
the parameters of (1) when the third one is
kept constant. In a situation similar to the
one we have, all these parameters do change.
Hence, we have to find relations among the
proportional changes in all the three parameters when all of them change. Taking the
natural logarithm of both sides of (1), we

get

= p log Ro.

From (2), by the principle of total differentials, we get

Ar = 72 log Ro + Rr" (3)
From (2) and (3), we get
Ar “st AR 1
rT TR, “Tos R, (4)

Ar, AR,, and AT are the changes in
r, R, and T respectively. Equation (4) can
be used to estimate the per cent reduction
in the birth rate under Assumption 2.

The method of computation is as follows.
From Equation (4) we set the per cent reduction in r. Let the new value of the intrinsic rate be 7’. For the given level of
mortality, this value 7’ of the intrinsic rate
determines a unique stable population
whose birth and death rates can be read
from the tables (Coale and Demeney,
1966). If b were the original birth rate to
start with, and 8’ the birth rate corresponding to the intrinsic rate 7’, then the per cent
reduction in the birth rate is (b — 0’)/{6) X
100. Male birth rate can be estimated by
employing the method suggested in the
United Nations Manual IV (1967, p. 60).
Reduction in the male birth rate can be
worked out under suitable assumptions. No

attempt is made here to find the per cent
reduction in the male birth rate.

DATA AND FINDINGS

The age-specific birth rates and the age
specific marital birth rates used for this
exercise are given in Table 1.

Model West mortality level No. 12 ensures an expectation of 47.5 years at birth
(Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad, 1967, use
United Nations Model Life Tables with the
same expectation of life at birth). A good
approximation of the length of generation is
the average of the mean ages of child-bearing in the stationary and stable populations
(Keyfitz, 19683, p. 126). However, following
Barclay (1958, p. 220), we approximate the
Jength of generation by the mean age at
childbearing in the stationary population,
since the error of this approximation is not
great (Keyfitz, 19685, p. 142).

The original and the new values of r
T, R, and 8 for the Indian female sopalation
are given in Table 2,

It is clear from Table 2 that the per cent
reduction in the female birth rate will not
be more than 14% in the course of a generation (i.e., within 28 to 29 years). If the
daughter generation has a greater expectation of life at birth than the mother generation, the per cent decline in the intrinsic
rate and hence in the birth rate will be
reduced. The Ryder (1959) correction can
be applied to estimate the reduction in such
a case,
