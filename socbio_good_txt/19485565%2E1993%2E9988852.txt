The Impact of Advances in Medicine E

of Infant Mortality .

ABSTRACT: Bourgeois-Pichat’s biometric model was developed as a method to decompose infant
mortality into endogenous and exogenous components. The model assumes that no endogenous
deaths occur after the first month of life. This paper uses data for the United States to examine
the hypothesis that recent advances in medicine extend endogenous mortality past the first month
of life. The biometric model is found consistently to underestimate the endogenous infant
mortality rate and to overestimate the exogenous infant mortality rate relative to cause of death
analysis. Direct examination of the age distribution of infant mortality shows that the proportion
of all infant mortality that occurs in the first month of life declined from 75.37 per cent in 1970
to 65.40 per cent in 1985, and that a significant and increasing proportion of the mortality
occurring after the first month of life is due to endogenous causes. The development of new

empirical models is suggested.

A distinction traditionally made in
the literature on infant mortality is between endogenous and exogenous infant mortality (Logan, 1953; Bouvier
and van der Tak, 1976). Endogenous
infant mortality is defined as all deaths
at ages under one year attributable to
factors preceding or associated with
birth (congenital anomalies, short gestation, low birth weight, birth trauma,
and certain other conditions originating in the perinatal period). Exogenous
infant mortality is defined as all deaths
under age one year attributable to factors in the postnatal environment (infectious diseases, poor nutrition, poisonings, and accidents) (Shryock and
Siegel, 1976, p. 418). While some question the utility of continuing to distinguish endogenous from exogenous infant mortality on the grounds that
many determinants of infant survival
are mediated through the social, be
havioral, and environmental characteristics of the mother (Eberstein
and Parker, 1984, p. 310; Geronimus,
1986), the rationale for continuing to
make and refine this distinction is that
endogenous and exogenous mortality
predominantly result from distinct sets
of causes, follow different trends over
time, and respond to different kinds of
preventive and ameliorative interventions.

The biometric model (BourgeoisPichat, 1946, 1950, 1951a, and 19515)!
was developed as a method for decomposing infant mortality into endogenous and exogenous components,
primarily for studies of historical pop

ulations where infectious diseases predominated and for studies of infant
mortality in populations where reliable
data on cause of death are not available. If reliable data are available, it is
possible to compute endogenous and
exogenous infant mortality rates directly by defining subsets of endogenous and exogenous causes of death
(cause of death analysis). The biometric model has been used in numerous
studies to adjust historical baptism registers for under-enumeration resulting
from mortality prior to baptism (Wrigley, 1977; Wrigley and Schofield, 1981,
pp. 97-102), to examine the plausibility of historical European data on infant deaths obtained from local parish
registers (Houdaille, 1980), and to estimate indirectly the endogenous and
exogenous infant mortality rates of
populations for which reliable causeof-death data are unavailable (Biraben
and Henry, 1957; Cantrelle and Leridon, 1971; Abdou Issa, 1972; Vallin,
1975; Cantrelle, 1980; Bley and Baudot, 1986; Baudot, 1989).

The biometric model is based on
three central assumptions: (1) the age
structure of deaths between 1 and 11
months of age remains constant across
time and location and is independent
of the prevailing level of mortality; (2)
no endogenous deaths occur after the
first month of life; and (3) the exoge
The infant mortality rate is conventionally expressed as the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live
births. Although this is in fact a ratio which approximates the probability of death among infants in a
given year rather than a demographic rate in the
strict sense of the term, I will follow this convention
in the analyses which follow. For example, the endogenous infant mortality rate is calculated as the
number of deaths under one year of age due to endogenous causes divided by the total number of live
births, multiplied by 1,000. For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Shryock and Siegel,
1976, p. 410-418.

nous deaths in the first month of life
follow the same pattern as those at ages
1 to 11 months. If these assumptions
obtain, the biometric model provides a
method for decomposing the total infant mortality rate into three additive
components: the endogenous rate, the
exogenous rate under age 1 month,
and the exogenous rate from I to 11
months of age.

Over the past century, infectious
diseases and other exogenous causes of
mortality have been reduced in the
United States and other developed
countries through the combined effects
of improvements in public works and
advances in medical knowledge and
technologies.3 In addition, advances in
medicine which impact on the survival
chances of infants with conditions of
endogenous origin have proceeded at
a remarkable pace (Hack et al., 1979;
Miller, 1985). Since Bourgeois-Pichat
first articulated the biometric model,
progress in neonatal intensive care and
numerous other medico-technological
innovations have sustained the lives of
many infants who otherwise would not
have survived, particularly premature
and low birth weight infants (Knobloch
et al., 1982; Gortmaker et al., 1985;
McCormick, 1987). However, these
medical advances may have resulted
in the short-term prolongation of life
for some infants such that they are

’There is considerable debate in the demographic literature related to the relative influence of
medical versus nonmedical interventions on the
overall decline of mortality in both more and less
developed countries (for example, see Preston,
1980; Preston, 1985). For the purposes of this paper,
I will leave this debate aside. I assume that medical
and nonmedical interventions have had some impact on the decline of both endogenous and exogenous infant mortality, but that the principal factors
which have impacted on endogenous infant mortality are the result of advances in medicine.

sustained through their first month but
die later during their first year (National Center for Health Statistics,
1966; Kulkarni et al., 1978; Hack et al.,
1980; Zdeb, 1982; Lantoine and Pressat, 1984; Stockwell et al., 1987).4 As
Poston and Rogers stated (1986, p.
328): ““We are still inclined to maintain
that medical technology, emphasizing
curative health care, has comparatively
little control over many deaths arising
from endogenous causes. New technology has saved very-low birth weight
neonates, sometiines through heroic
measures, but we wonder whether infant deaths are averted or merely prolonged.”

This paper examines the hypothesis
that the assumptions underlying the biometric model are no longer valid for
the United States because advances in
medicine have resulted in the extension of endogenous mortality past the
first month of life. I begin with an indepth examination of the biometric
model using data for the United States
for selected years from 1935 to 1985. I
then compare the estimated endogenous and exogenous infant mortality
rates derived from the biometric model
and cause-of-death analysis respectively for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985. If
advances in medical technology have
resulted in the short-term prolongation
of life for some infants so that an increasing proportion of deaths from 1 to

4Many of the studies cited in this section are primarily concerned with the congruence between neonatal mortality and endogenous mortality rates and
postneonatal mortality and exogenous mortality
rates, respectively. There is growing agreement in
the literature that the neonatal mortality rate is not
an appropriate proxy for the endogenous mortality
rate because a considerable proportion of endogenous mortality occurs at ages above 28 days. Additionally, a proportion of the mortality that occurs in
the neonatal period is due to exogenous causes.

Social Biology

11 months of age are due to endogenous causes, then the biometric model
should underestimate the endogenous
infant mortality rate and overestimate
the total exogenous infant mortality
rate (the sum of the exogenous infant
mortality rate under age 1 month and
the exogenous infant mortality rate
from 1 to 11 months of age) relative to
the same rates obtained from cause of
death analysis. Finally, I will directly
examine the age distribution of endogenous deaths in the first year of life for
the United States in 1970, 1975, 1980,
and 1985 to determine whether a significant proportion of the mortality occurring after the first month of life is
due to endogenous causes.

THE BIOMETRIC MODEL

The biometric model posits an invariant linear relationship between the
cumulative infant mortality rates from
ages 1 to 11 months and age, once
age is transformed by the function
flog(n+1)3], where is age in days
since birth. Once age has been linearized, the endogenous and exogenous
infant mortality rates can be estimated
as shown in Figure 1.5

Figure 1 illustrates the application
of the biometric model to data for the
United States in 1935. The estimated
endogenous infant mortality rate is
found by extrapolating to age zero the
straight line formed by the cumulative
mortality rates from 1 to 11 months
of age (see dotted line AC). The

>The denominator for the calculation of all rates
between 1935 and 1955 is the adjusted number of
live births. The estimates presented in this section
were calculated using the ordinary least squares regression model for 1935. See further discussion of
the use of regression to correct for nonlinearity later
in this text.

Y-intercept is the estimated endogenous infant mortality rate under age 1
month (A on the graph). The estimated exogenous infant mortality rate
under age 1 month (segment AB) is obtained by subtracting the endogenous
infant mortality rate from the cumulative infant mortality rate under age 1
month (C on the graph). The exogenous infant mortality rate from 1 to 11
months of age (segment BD) is obtained by subtracting the cumulative
infant mortality rate under age 1
month from the total infant mortality
rate (D on the graph). Thus, the total
infant mortality rate is 50.97 per 1,000
live births; the endogenous rate is
24.54 per 1,000 live births; the total exogenous rate is 26.42 per 1,000 live
births; the exogenous rate under age I
month is 5.54 per 1,000 live births; and
the exogenous rate from 1 to 11 months
is 20.88 per 1,000 live births.

DEVIATIONS FROM THE EXPECTED
LINEAR PATTERN

Although the biometric model has
been generally accepted and widely
utilized, there are a number of cases
cited in the literature where the expected linear relationship has not been
found. For example, Bourgeois-Pichat
(1952a) describes the case of Sardinia
from 1948 to 1950. In this case cumulative mortality was found to rise more
rapidly after the fourth month of life
than was expected on the basis of mortality from ages 1 to 3 months. The
more rapid rise in mortality after the
fourth month was attributed to deaths
from digestive impairments associated
with the cessation of breastfeeding and
the beginning of dietary supplementation. Other studies have reported this
pattern of increased mortality in the

latter half of the first year of life associated with prolonged breastfeeding
(Biraben and Henry, 1957; Cantrelle
and Leridon, 1971, p. 512).

Knodel and Kintner (1977) used the
biometric model to analyze the effect
of differences in breastfeeding practices on infant mortality. Consistent
deviations from the expected linear relationship were found for populations
where breastfeeding was common and
for populations where breastfeeding
was uncommon. In populations where
breastfeeding was common and long in
duration, mortality was found to rise
more rapidly in the later months of the
first year of life than expected on the
basis of mortality in the earlier months.
In populations where breastfeeding
was uncommon or very short in duration, the reverse pattern was found;
mortality increased more rapidly in the
first few months of life than in the latter
half of the first year of life. The authors
note that deviations from the expected
linear relationship are problematic because the estimated endogenous mortality is greatly affected by which data
points within the first year of life are
chosen as the basis for the estimation.
The authors discuss their results in
terms of their implications for the application of the biometric model in
studies of historical demography where
the model is sometimes used to test the
plausibility of data on infant deaths extracted from parish registers, and in
studies of less developed countries
where trends toward declining or
shortened breastfeeding have been observed.

A different nonlinear pattern of biometric model results was found for
Quebec from 1944 to 1947 (BourgeoisPichat, 195la, 1952a). In this case, cu

mulative mortality after 6 months of
age was found to rise more slowly than
expected on the basis of the mortality
from 1 to 6 months of age. This more
rapid rise in mortality was attributed in
part to medical advances which prolonged the lives of some infants such
that endogenous deaths occurred after
the first month of life, and, in part, to
certain sanitary and medical techniques that can only be applied after
the infant has reached a certain age.®
Although Bourgeois-Pichat himself
recognized that ‘medical treatment, in
extending the life of malformed or
feeble children, has increased the proportion of endogenous deaths after
the first month’ (Bourgeois-Pichat,
(1951a] 1981, p. 13), there has been
only one recent study of the impact of
the extension of endogenous deaths
past 1 month of age on the biometric
analysis of infant mortality (Lantoine
and Pressat, 1984).

BIoMETRIC MODEL RESULTS FOR THE
UNITED STATES, 1935-1985,
SELECTED YEARS

The results obtained from the biometric model summarize the decline of
infant mortality in the United States.
Figure 2 shows the application of the
biometric model to data for the United
States for selected years from 1935 to
1985. Leaving aside for the moment
the deviations from linearity which
caution that the biometric model may
not be operating as intended, Figure 2
summarizes the magnitude of the overall decline of infant mortality (the

©The observed pattern could also be interpreted
as an example of the pattern observed by Knodel
and Kintner (1977) for populations where breast

change in the highest point on each
line), the decline of exogenous infant
mortality at ages 1 to 11 months (the
change in the slopes), the decline of exogenous infant mortality under age 1
month (the change in the difference
between the Y-intercept and the absent horizontal line extended from the
lowest point on each line back to the
Y-axis), and the decline of endogenous
infant mortality (the change in the
Y-intercept).

Table 1 presents the estimated rates
obtained from the biometric model
from 1935 to 1985 at five-year intervals. In order to avoid the estimation
problem that arises from any deviations from linearity, ordinary least
squares regression was used to obtain
the best-fitting straight line for each
year. The cumulative infant mortality
rates were regressed on the biometric
age coefficients to obtain a set of linear
equations. The rates presented in Table 1 were calculated using these regression equations. The last column of
Table 1 presents the R-Square for the
model used to calculate the rates for
each year. Over time, the degree of linearity has decreased as indicated by the
decline in R-Square from 0.9983 in
1935 to 0.9549 in 1985.

Table 1 indicates that in 1935 the endogenous infant mortality rate was
slightly lower than the total exogenous
infant mortality rate (24.54 and 26.42
respectively). In 1940 and thereafter,
the endogenous infant mortality rate
was higher than the total exogenous
infant mortality rate. Thus, these estimates suggest that, beginning sometime between 1935 and 1940, infant
mortality in the United States changed
from being primarily exogenous to primarily endogenous in character. It is

important to remember that these estimates were obtained under the assumption that endogenous infant mortality is limited to the first month of
life. If endogenous mortality occurs after age one month, then the biometric
model will underestimate the endogenous infant mortality rate and overestimate the exogenous infant mortality
rate. If this is the case, then the timing
of the cross-over might shift. Additionally, infant mortality in the United
States after the cross-over would be
even more endogenous in character
and the decline of exogenous infant
mortality would be even greater than
implied by these estimates.

Figure 3 illustrates the trends in the
biometric model estimates of the total,
endogenous, and total exogenous infant mortality rates from Table 1. In
addition to the crossover between the
endogenous and exogenous infant
mortality rates which occurred between 1935 and 1940, Figure 3 illustrates that the exogenous infant mortality rate declined much more rapidly
than the endogenous infant mortality

rate between 1935 and 1965. After
1965, the decline in the endogenous infant mortality rate sharpened. These
trends are consistent with data presented by Bouvier and van der Tak
(1976, Figure 3, p. 17). These authors
present infant mortality rates by age at
death for the United States from 1915
to 1974. Beginning around 1965, there
is a sharp downturn in the under-1~day
and 1-2-day mortality rates. Between
1965 and 1974, the first-day and 1-2day mortality rates each declined by
approximately 30 per cent. This substantial decline in endogenous mortality was attributed to “‘the recent
progress in tackling the special threats
which jeopardize a newborn infant’s
first days of life’ (pp. 16-17).

from the biometric model which assumes that endogenous mortality is restricted to the first month of life. If this
underlying assumption is no longer

valid, so that an increasing proportion
of the mortality from ages 1 to 11
months is due to endogenous causes,
then the biometric model should underestimate the endogenous mortality
rate and overestimate the total exogenous mortality rate relative to estimates obtained from cause-of-death
analysis. To address this question, I
will compare the estimates derived
from the biometric model with estimates obtained from cause-of-death
analysis using data for the United
States for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.
Bourgeois-Pichat employed this same
analytic strategy to determine the validity of the empirical relationships
which are the foundation of the biometric model (for example, see
Bourgeois-Pichat, 1952b).

There are two reasons why 1970 was
chosen as the cutoff for this analysis.
First, a large part of the progress in
the development of effective medical
interventions that impact the survival
chances of physiologically weak infants has occurred since 1970 (Hack
et al., 1979). Major advances in neonatal intensive care, amniocentesis, ultrasound, advances in genetic-screening techniques for various congenital
anomalies, selective abortions, fetal
monitoring, and other medico-technological innovations aimed at either
preventing the births of physiologically
weak infants or sustaining their lives
have emerged relatively recently. The
choice of 1970 as the cutoff for this
analysis is somewhat arbitrary with respect to this issue, although I considered it reasonable to assume that if a
large or increasing proportion of
deaths due to endogenous causes were
being postponed until later in the first
year of life, then it would be most apparent after 1970.

Infant Mortality

269

The second and more important
reason for focusing on this time period
arises from the need to have a consistent series of data available for the delineation of endogenous and exogenous of causes of death. The period
1970 to 1985 spans one revision of the
International Classification of Diseases
(ICD): the eighth revision of the ICD
(ICD-8) covers the years 1970-1975,
while the years 1980-1985 are covered
by the ninth revision of the ICD (ICD9). To extend the analysis to include
the period prior to 1970 would entail
including at least one more, and, depending on how far back the analysis
was extended, possibly many more revisions of the ICD. In order to include
even this one revision of the classification system in the analysis, I had to assume that a consistent subset of endogenous and exogenous causes of death
could be defined. While this may seem
like a relatively benign assumption, it
was necessary in light of the potential
impact of the introduction of sudden
infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a distinct cause of death after 1979.

Various strategies have been suggested in the literature to deal with
SIDS. Poston and Rogers (1985), Poston (1986), and Frisbie et al. (1991) exclude SIDS deaths from their analyses.
Stockwell et al. (1987) classify SIDS
as an endogenous cause of death. For
the purposes of this analysis, I assume
that SIDS is an exogenous cause of
death and that deaths from SIDS in
1970 and 1975 were primarily attributed to exogenous cause-of-death categories. This assumption is based on
the findings of Nam et al. (1989) and
Leatherman (1991) that SIDS cases resemble deaths from accidents more
than deaths from congenital anomalies on a number of background and

270

intermediate variables. Given that
SIDS mortality tends to occur at ages
older than 1 month and is more common than all other causes of mortality
combined at age 3 months (Knight,
1983), and that social factors appear to
influence SIDS mortality, the classification of SIDS as an exogenous cause
of death in this analysis is reasonable.
In order to increase further the likelihood of delineating a consistent series
of endogenous and exogenous causes
of death, I have limited the analysis
to broad categories of cause of death
rather than specific causes of death.
Congenital Anomalies and Certain
Conditions Originating in the Perinatal
Period are the two broad cause-ofdeath categories that I selected as endogenous causes. These two broad
cause of death categories are “generally considered”’ to include the endogenous causes of death (Eberstein and
Parker, 1985, p. 312). For the purpose
of this analysis, all other causes of
death are assumed to be exogenous.
Table 2 presents the specific causes
of death included in the broad Congenital Anomalies and Certain Conditions
Originating in the Perinatal Period categories by revision of the ICD. Comparison of the broad category of Congenital Anomalies across revisions of
the classification system reveals that
there was almost no change in the
specific cause-of-death categories that
comprise it. Thus, the broad cause-ofdeath category Congenital Anomalies
appears to be consistent across the revision of the classification system.
Comparison of the Certain Causes
of Mortality in Early Infancy (1970 and
1975) and Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period (1980
and 1985) categories, on the other
hand, reveals that there was a consid
London

Social Biology

erable amount of adjustment in the
specific cause-of-death categories in
addition to the change in the name of
the category heading. For the purposes
of this analysis, I assume that the Certain Causes of Mortality in Early Infancy category and the Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal
Period category are comparable despite the fact that their finer subdivisions might not be. In other words, I
assume that deaths that would fall under the heading of Certain Causes of
Mortality in Early Infancy in 1970 and
1975 would fall under the heading of
Certain Conditions Originating in the
Perinatal Period in 1980 and 1985, although the specific causes of death to
which they are attributed might not be
the same.

As a check to make sure that these
two broad categories of cause of death
are suitable proxies for the endogenous
causes of death, I examined the proportion of all mortality occurring under
24 hours, under 7 days, and under 1
month of age that was accounted for by
these two cause of death categories. I
hypothesized that if these two broad
cause-of-death categories were in fact
capturing the endogenous causes of
death, then they should account for a
very high percentage of the mortality
within each of these age categories,
particularly under 24 hours and under
7 days of age.

Table 3 shows the results of this
analysis. The Congenital Anomalies
and Certain Conditions Originating in
the Perinatal Period categories account
for 96.10 per cent of the mortality occurring under 24 hours in 1970, 95.20
per cent in 1975, 97.85 per cent in 1980,
and 97.55 per cent in 1985. For mortality occurring in the first week of life,
these two categories account for 93.58

gories are suitable proxies for the endogenous cause of death.

It is interesting to note that the overall consistency of the proportion of the
deaths within each of these age categories that are accounted for by the
combination of these two broad cause
of death categories masks a considerable amount of change in the relative
contribution of each. In each of the
three age categories, the proportion of

 

 
 

Vol. 40, No. 3-4

mortality attributable to the category
Congenital Anomalies is increasing
and the proportion attributable to the
category Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period is decreasing. Considering the age category under 24 hours, the proportion of the
mortality occurring at that age that is
accounted for by the category Congenital Anomalies increased from 8:75 per

A per cent in 1970 to 68.52 per cent in
1985. The observed trend is primarily
the result of the great reduction in the
number of deaths due to Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period, particularly mortality attributable
to low birth weight and prematurity.
Before turning to a discussion of the
results of the comparison of the rates
obtained from the biometric model and
cause-of-death analysis, I would like to
discuss briefly the expected impact of

 

Infant Mortality

the use of the regression equations to
correct for the nonlinearity in the biometric model. Referring back to Figure
2, we See that the biometric transformations for these years indicate that
the cumulative infant mortality rate increases more rapidly in the first few
months of life than in the later months
of the first year of life. On the basis of
this pattern of nonlinearity, the bestfitting straight line obtained from the
regression of the cumulative infant
mortality rates on the biometric age coefficients will overestimate the cumulative infant mortality rates at the beginning and the end of the first year of
life and will underestimate the cumulative infant mortality rates in the middle of the first year of life. Thus, the
use of the regression equations to obtain the biometric estimates will tend
to inflate the estimates of the total infant mortality rate and the estimates of
the endogenous infant mortality rates
since these are calculated at the extremes of the first year of life. This inflation bias should be kept in mind
when examining the results of the comparisons of the total and endogenous
infant mortality rates. With respect to
the endogenous infant mortality rates
calculated from the biometric model,
this inflation factor is particularly relevant because it was hypothesized that
the biometric model would underestimate this rate relative to cause of death
analysis if endogenous mortality was
being postponed past the first month of
life.

comparison of the estimates of the

age 1 month, and the exogenous infant
mortality rate from ages 1 to 11 months
of age obtained from the biometric
model and cause of death analysis respectively. As expected, comparison of
the total infant mortality rates shows
that the biometric model overestimates
this rate by 1.90 per cent in 1970, 2.35
per cent in 1975, 2.77 per cent in 1980,
and 3.04 per cent in 1985. Comparison
of the endogenous infant mortality
rates derived from these two methods
shows that the biometric model consistently underestimates the endogenous
infant mortality rate relative to causeof-death analysis, and that from 1970

to 1985 the degree of underestimation
increases. The per cent difference is
—1.06 in 1970, —1.31 in 1975, —10.57
in 1980, and —11.51 in 1985. Comparison of the total exogenous infant mortality rate derived from these two
methods shows that the biometric
model consistently overestimates this
rate relative to cause-of-death analysis,
and the degree of overestimation increases from 9.87 per cent in 1970 to
35.14 per cent in 1985. These results
are consistent with those that would be
expected if a significant proportion of
endogenous deaths are being postponed until later in the first year of

life. The large increase in the degree
of underestimation of the endogenous

infant mortality rate obtained from the.

biometric model between 1975 and
1980 may in part be the result of the
treatment of SIDS as an exogenous
cause of death in this analysis. If some
deaths under age 1 month that would
have been attributed to an endogenous
cause of death prior to the introduction of SIDS are attributed to SIDS after 1979 and are treated as exogenous
in this analysis, then this change might
in part account for the increased underestimation of endogenous mortality
in 1980 and 1985. This increased underestimation might also in part be an
artifact of changes in the pattern of
nonlinearty in the biometric transformation.

The results of this comparison are
consistent with the hypothesis that advances in medicine have resulted in
the short-term prolongation of life for
some infants. Assuming that the estimates derived from this cause-of-death
analysis are more accurate than those
derived from the biometric model,
these results also indicate that the endogenous infant mortality rate did not
decline as sharply as implied by the
trends depicted in Figure 3. Thus, we
can conclude that infant mortality in
the United States during 1970 to 1985
was even more endogenous in character than implied by the trends in the
biometric model estimates shown in
Figure 3.

Table 4 also shows the decomposition of the total exogenous infant mortality rate into the exogenous mortality
rate under age 1 month and the exogenous mortality rate from 1 to 11
months of age. With respect to the exogenous infant mortality rate under
age 1 month, the biometric model

Infant Mortality

275

underestimates by 15.60 per cent in
1970 and 16.49 per cent in 1975 relative to cause-of-death analysis. However, in 1980 and 1985, the biometric
model overestimates this rate by 85.25
per cent and 87.08 per cent respectively. As discussed above, this change
from underestimation to overestimation may in part be a result of changes
in the pattern of nonlinearity in the biometric transformation and may in
part be a result of introduction of SIDS
as a specific cause of death after 1979.

With respect to the exogenous infant mortality rate from 1 to 11
months, the biometric model consistently overestimates relative to cause
_of-death analysis: in 1970, the per cent

difference is 19.44; in 1975, the per
cent difference is 21.58; in 1980, the
per cent difference is 24.71; and in
1985, the per cent difference is 25.86.
Since it is assumed that no endogenous
mortality occurs after age 1 month, all
deaths from age 1 to 11 months contribute to the biometric model estimate
of exogenous mortality. The cause-ofdeath estimate of exogenous mortality
from 1 to 11 months, on the other
hand, is based only on deaths between
ages 1 and 11 months which are not attributed to the broad cause-of-death
categories Congenital Anomalies and
Certain Conditions Originating in the
Perinatal Period. Thus, this result suggests that there may be considerable
endogenous mortality after the first
month of life.

all causes that occur under age 1 month
and from 1 to 11 months of age for the
United States in 1970, 1975, 1980, and
1985. The second column of Table 5
shows that the percentage of all mortality in the first year of life that occurred in the first month of Itfe declined from 75.37 per cent in 1970 to
65.40 per cent in 1985. This decline indicates that the overall trend in infant
mortality from 1970 to 1985 is for an
increasing proportion of all deaths under age 1 year to occur after age 1
month. This finding is somewhat surprising since it has generally been hypothesized that as infant mortality
declines, the proportion of mortality
occurring in the first four weeks of life
will increase (Bouvier and van der Tak,
1976, p. 16). The critical question for
the purposes of this analysis is: Are
deaths due to endogenous causes being
postponed until later in the first year of
life?

Figure 4 shows the percentage of
deaths at each age that result from en
dogenous causes for the years 1970,
1975, 1980, and 1985. It is apparent
that approximately 20 to 30 per cent of
the mortality that occurs at each age
after the first month of life is due
to endogenous causes. Additionally,
from 1970 to 1985, the proportion of
mortality that is the result of endogenous causes increases at almost every
age above 4 months. These results indicate that endogenous deaths occur
throughout the first year of life, and
that they may even extend beyond the
first year of life. These results are consistent with several other recent reports (Lantoine and Pressat, 1984;
Stockwell et al., 1987).

Table 6 presents the age distribution
of endogenous mortality for the United
States in 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.
The first column of Table 6 shows that
the percentage of all infant deaths

causes declined from 72.91 per cent in
1970 to 69.02 per cent in 1985. This

infant mortality rate has declined more
rapidly than the exogenous infant mortality rate over this period. The second
column shows that the percentage of
all infant deaths that are accounted for
by endogenous deaths under age 1
month declined from 67.99 per cent in
1970 to 60.72 per cent in 1985. The
third column shows that the percentage
of all infant deaths that are accounted
for by endogenous deaths at 1 to 11

Thus, it appears that part of the decline
in the proportion of all infant mortality
that is accounted for by deaths occurring under age 1 month ts the result of
the short-term prolongation of life for
some infants.

Tables 7 and 8 present this same
analysis for the cause-of-death categories Congenital Anomalies and Certain

The first column of Table 7 shows that

10.49 per cent in 1970 to 15.91 per cent

1970 to 2.83 per cent in 1985. This represents a nine-fold increase over the
course of fifteen years.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

T have shown that there is increasing
nonlinearity in the biometric model
transformation for the United States.
Comparison of the endogenous and exogenous infant mortality rates obtained from the biometric model and
cause-of-death analysis respectively indicates that the biometric model underestimates the endogenous infant
mortality rate and overestimates the
exogenous infant mortality rate relative to cause-of-death analysis. This
finding is consistent with what would
be expected if endogenous infant mortality occurred after the first month of
life.

Direct examination of the age pattern of infant mortality from all causes
indicates that the proportion of mortality occurring under age 1 month declined from 75.37 per cent in 1970 to
65.40 per cent in 1985. Furthermore,
the proportion of all infant mortality
that is attributable to endogenous
deaths at ages 1-11 months increased
from 4.92 per cent in 1970 to 8.30 per
cent in 1985. This change was due primarily to the increase in the proportion
of deaths at 1~11 months of age that
were attributable to the category Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period. Finally, at each age from
1 to 11 months, between 20 and 30 per
cent of deaths are attributable to endogenous causes.

Taken together, these results are
consistent with the argument that advances in medicine have been effective

 

Social Biology

in reducing mortality due to endogenous causes. However, these results
also suggest that advances in medicine
may result in the short-term prolongation of life for a significant number
of infants. Finally, these results indicate that endogenous mortality occurs
throughout the whole of the first year
of life and may even extend beyond it.

In this paper I have argued that the
biometric model no longer provides a
reasonable empirical characterization
of infant mortality in the United States
because the assumption that endogenous mortality is confined to the first
month of life is increasingly violated.
Due to the short-term prolongation of
the lives of some infants, the biometric
model consistently underestimates the
endogenous infant mortality rate and
overestimates the total exogenous infant mortality rate relative to cause-ofdeath analysis. While the results reported in this paper are specific to the
United States, it is probable that similar results could be found for other
more developed countries, and possibly some less developed countries as
well. This research suggests that new
empirical models which incorporate
endogenous mortality that occurs after
the first month of life should be developed.
