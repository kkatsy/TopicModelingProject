ABSTRACT: The Vietnam 1988 survey established the first national estimates for reproductive
— preferences and behavior. It created a unique baseline for levels and differentials, both for the
Cimarked differences between North and South, and for various social and demographic cateO gories. It also provided the first national data for program guidance, including information on
unmet need. Unmet need for contraception has been extensively documented for much of the de$ veloping world, but its structure is not yet well understood. This study differentiates unmet-need
A couples by several demographic characteristics, by time since the last birth, and by features idenoo tified through a computer search program. Past investigations have emphasized the per cent
~_ With unmet need within various population subgroups, but some of those subgroups are small,
"whereas the national family planning program must be oriented to subgroups with large absolute
—numbers of unmet need couples. Unmet-need couples are selective, whether by reference to the
married population or by reference to other couples who also wish to avoid pregnancy but are
‘gusing a method. Most unmet-need couples are younger than users, have fewer children and, es- expecially, are closer to their last birth. Surprisingly, most have never used a contraceptive method
before, even though Vietnam has had a vigorous family planning program and 49 per cent of all
couples in the survey reported some experience with a modern contraceptive method. In terms of
q Sheer numbers, those in need are distributed very widely throughout the country. The most disppdvantaged segments of the population have both high percentages and large numbers in need,
“=but the concentration of the national program upon a single contraceptive method restricts their

Goptions.

e

~ Contraceptive prevalence is now mod- population since many non-using couples
zerately high in Vietnam, but it is based — still donot wanta pregnancy. _

The recent literature on unmet need
expands the concept quite broadly, going
beyond the basic definition of fecund cohabiting women not wanting a pregnancy

heavily upon one method, the IUD.
‘gAbout one-third of all couples in three
national surveys (1988, 1993, and 1994)
= were using the JUD, and about half had

Fever-used it. Only China (33 per cent),
Egypt (30 per cent), and Cuba (33 per
cent) approximate this level of current
IUD use, and other methods play important roles in China and Cuba. Where one
method is nearly the only option, many
couples are necessarily non-users due to
dislike of the method, unhappy experiences with its side effects, accidental
pregnancies while using it, or limited access to it. This situation has made for
substantial unmet need in the Vietnamese

who still use no protection. Definitional
variations encompass unmarried women,
dissatisfied users, those with other reproductive health needs, and those desiring
abortion -(Dixon-Mueller and Germain,
1992). However, the bulk of the quantitative literature rests on survey data that
pertain to the basic narrower definition,
and that is what we necessarily use here.
Even that definition can vary, as it has
over the years in the work of Westoff and
colleagues (Westoff and Ochoa, 1991a,

111

Ross and Pham

1991b; Westoff and Bankole, 1995). Also,
the surveys themselves differ in what information they offer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this paper we focus on unmet need
as measured in the 1988 national Vietnam survey (NCPFP, 1990), which was
based largely upon the DHS model and
included 3,890 married or cohabiting
women. The 1988 questionnaire includes
most of the items used by DHS, but the
precise definition of unmet need must be
adjusted here due to some differences. In
particular, the questionnaire did not differentiate between spacers and limiters,
so unmet need here can refer to either.
Survey details appear in Dang (1995) and
in NCPFP (1990). Additional recent studies of Vietnamese family planning and
fertility include Allman et al. (1991),
Hieu et al. (1995), Knodel et al. (1995),
Phai et al. (1996), and Vu and Hannenberg (1989).

Unmet need here is based on MWRA
(married or cohabiting women aged
{5—49) and includes women who want no
more children soon or ever (not separated
in the original question) but are not using
any contraception. Infecund couples are
excluded, defined as not pregnant, no
birth in the last five years despite constant
cohabitation and no contraceptive use in
that period; or over age 35 with only 0-1
child and constant cohabitation; or no
menstruation in the last three months not
attributable to postpartum amenorrhea.
The exclusion based on no birth in five
years may err for those who ended pregnancies by abortion, but overall the rules
remove women who use nothing because
they know they are infecund.

Social Biology

 

Some pregnant women are added to
the unmet-need group: all those who are
at or above their desired family size, including the current pregnancy (the survey
did not ask whether the pregnancy was
unwanted or ill-timed). Also added are fecund non-users who said yes when asked
if they would be unhappy to become
pregnant within the next few weeks. Under these various inclusions and exclusions 29 per cent of MWRA have unmet
need, and these women are the basis of
what follows. The variations we tested on
these definitions produce essentially the
same patterns and conclusions.

Moreover, the chief interest here is in
differentials rather than exact levels, and
for that the above serves quite well. The
latest fix on the level of unmet need,
which also departs from the usual DHS
definition, is in Table 10 of Phai et al.
(1996); total need there ranges from 21
per cent of couples to 36 per cent, reflecting mainly the inclusion of traditional
method users. The figures would be
larger except for the exclusion of some
pregnant or amenorrheic women who
said their pregnancy or last birth was
wanted at the time of pregnancy. Certainly some of those women do not want
the next pregnancy soon or ever and
should be listed with unmet need, especially as some will conceive earlier than
they wish to. The usual DHS definition is
also defective in this regard by referring
to the past rather than the future.

RESULTS
Wuo Has Unmet NEED?

Unmet-need women are distributed
broadly throughout the population, both

geographically and demographically. They
are a diverse group, but certain characteristics usefully differentiate them. Here we
stress the distinction between a subgroup
of the unmet-need women themselves,
versus a subgroup of the general population having a high per cent of its own
members with unmet need. The first distributes only the unmet-need women; the
- second distinguishes population subgroups
= by the density of unmet need. National action programs must address the former,
S whereas the latter is of analytic interest.
© Table 1 summarizes the patterns. The
Aleft column gives the distribution of the
scunmet-need women, and the right column
t gives the per cent of all MWRA having
counmet need. The distribution shows where

gabsolute terms, while the percentages disSteriminate among subgroups of all cou“Sples. The latter prevails in the literature,
= but the two can give quite different impressions, and the former is more useful
Ffor program purposes.
Number of living children—Here we
‘= see how important it can be to look at both
a distribution and the per cent (Figure 1).
e two give quite contrary pictures. The
Sdistibution on the left, is weighted toS ward smaller families, whereas the sharp
Frise in the per cent of women with need
4 follows the reverse pattern. At the extreme,
55 per cent of those with 8+ children have
need, but only 6 per cent of couples have
that many children. The two patterns are
opposite, and the action program must
chiefly follow the left rather than the right
one.

Age.—The age distribution of those
with unmet need is broad from age 20 upward. Few are aged 15-19 because relatively few Vietnamese women are married
then, and those who are married usually

want a child. The 45-49 group, at 14 per
cent of the total, is larger than the two just
below it; fecundity or coital frequency of
the couple is diminished then and some
women clearly do not want a pregnancy
but are not using a method because they
do not need to. (In numerous surveys the
direct queries on fecundity are not successful in screening out all such couples,
which helps explain why some of the
unmet-need group say they do not intend
to use contraception.)

The per cent of all couples with unmet
need is even at about 30 per cent from
ages 20 through 34 and is not much
different through age 44. Thus, age does
not discriminate well between those with
and without unmet need. From the program’s standpoint, however, nearly half
of unmet-need women, in terms of sheer
numbers, fall between ages 25 and 34.

The open birth interval.—The open interval distribution (time since last birth)
for unmet-need women is marked by a
heavy concentration of women with young
infants (Figure 2). These women include
amenorrheic women who do not wish another pregnancy soon, or ever, and have
not yet obtained contraceptive assistance.
Amenorrheic women are not exposed at
the instant of the interview, but many soon
will be, and the most fecund ones will
conceive quickly after the first ovulation
and return to the currently pregnant group
with the high risk that the ensuing short
birth interval carries for the infants.
Breastfeeding is common in Vietnam, but
exclusive breastfeeding for six months is
another matter, and contraceptive assistance is needed if early conceptions and
brief birth intervals are to be minimized.

Between a quarter and a half of unmetneed women were currently pregnant or
amenorrheic in the analysis of 26 countries

married women as they age. Both trends
are quite basic to program planning.

The per cent in need also declines for
longer intervals, although not as sharply
as does the distribution of unmet need
women. It is clear that the program will
find the highest density, and numbers, of
unmet-need women close to their last
birth. Many of these are couples early in
their childbearing careers, for whom
spacing methods are appropriate. Others
are at their last wanted birth and wish to
terminate childbearing.

Education.—The distribution of unmetneed women by education 1s largely within Form 1-9 (primary education). However, this distribution also reflects that of
the general population which has a high
literacy level. The per cent in need is very
high in the illiterate group, but only 9 per
cent of unmet-need women are illiterate.
The group of second importance, in the
balance of numbers and per cents, is the
“can read” group, which is sizable and
also has a substantial per cent (38 per
cent) in need.

UNMET NEED WOMEN COMPARED TO
CONTRACEPTIVE USERS

Women without unmet need are
chiefly of two types: those who are using
a method, and those who are not doing so

Unmet Need in Vietnam

because they actively want another child.
The quite different character of the two
groups appears in Figure 3, for number of
living children. Nonusers (extreme right)
mainly have either no child or only one,
while users (middle) mainly have two or
more. Unmet-need women (on left) are
intermediate in family size; on average
they have fewer children than users do
but more than the non-users do.

A useful comparison is between unmet-need women and users. Both groups
wish to avoid pregnancy, but one Is acting
on this wish and the other is not. The determinants of this difference are manifold, and we do not have all the data
needed for a full exploration. Some determinants concern visits by fieldworkers,
exposure to mass media, involvement in
diffusion networks, and the family/living
context of the woman, and we lack such
information. Here we briefly compare the
two groups on three demographic items
(Table 2).

(a) Family size: The groups differ
somewhat in their family sizes; almost no
women in either group are childless, but
users are somewhat concentrated at 2-4
children, while unmet-need women are
more prominent at 1-3 and 6+ children.
Probably the fact of contraceptive adoption has helped keep users out of the
higher parity groups. Also, more of them
may have relied on abortion or menstrual
regulation. Both are widely available and
widely used (Goodkind, 1994).

(b) Age: The two groups hardly differ
in their age patterns, except that there are
fewer users at ages 20-24 and more at
ages 30-44.

(c) Open birth interval: The sharpest
difference between the two groups is in
their open birth intervals. Far more unmetneed women have a young child, and far

fewer have the youngest child at age two
and above. Which comes first? Contraceptive use that extends the interval, or a
recent birth that occasions a delay in obtaining contraception? The dynamics of
the birth interval may determine part of
unmet need, at least in Vietnam. Users
and non-users have roughly similar ages
and somewhat similar family sizes. Assuming some homogeneity in those re© spects, then many women with a recent

g PREDICTORS OF UNMET MEED

© . .
Q ~~ Another approach to these questions is

possible through an exploratory computer
search program, termed CHAID, for ChiSquared Automatic Interaction Detector
(part of SPSS). Briefly, one chooses a dependent variable such as unmet need and
enters a variety of determinants, or predictors, which are then examined to identify the most efficient one. The next best
determinants are also given, to show
whether the best one exceeds the others
by a clear margin. The top two may be

119

very close and the second best may be
more useful as a guide for program strategy. Selections of determinants, and of
the best split within each determinant, are
made by a chi-square routine.

Unmet need is 29 per cent for the entire sample (top of Figure 4), and the
open interval is identified as the best determinant by a large margin over the others (not shown). A high 49 per cent appears for the shortest open interval group,
falling regularly to 16 per cent for women
who are 60-83 months past their last
birth. It then rises to 23 per cent for
women in the final group, probably reflecting their low risk of pregnancy and
perception of no need for contraception.

Each open interval group now becomes
a fresh exercise. The leftmost group is
divided into those with 0-5 children, with
47 per cent in need, and those with 6+
children, with 7! per cent in need. (Again,
this division and all others are specific to
the open interval group involved.) Comparable divisions are made for the next
two open interval groups. Interactions then
appear. For the 60-83 months group, a
breakout by age is most efficient, isolating
the group at 40-44 with high unmet need,
which no doubt reflects their subfecundity
and lack of interest in contraception. For
the open interval group at 84+ months,
where the youngest child is over eight
years old, education is the most efficient
predictor. Even though it is less useful as a
fieldworker guide, it is left in here for purposes of illustration. Exploratory work
with the software showed the open interval
and the number of children to be clearly
superior to alternative variables. Moreover,
they are convenient guides for field staff to
identify couples with unmet need.

Further splits can be made to extend the
tree in Figure 4, until one of the stopping

rules intervenes: either no split meets the
0.05 significance level used here, or the
chosen number of levels is reached (two
here), or the next candidate subgroup has
less than 50 members.

Thus, the CHAID program is useful
for exploratory work, and for quickly
sorting out which determinants best differentiate between high and low values
on the dependent variable. One can override its automatic choices and force splits
by alternative variables, or one can use a
preliminary run to suggest an alternative
sequence of levels. We could, for example, force a first split on number of children and then examine open interval
splits in the second level. Unlike multiple
regression methods, CHAID is entirely
flexible for highlighting interactions, and
it does so for specific groups that can

to the closeness of alternative predictors,

and second levels.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper is meant to help to clarify
the structure of unmet need for family
planning procedures in the Vietnamese
population, and the following are the essential observations.

1.—1In terms of sheer numbers, those in
need are distributed very widely throughout the country, and widely by age. They
are somewhat concentrated within smaller
families, particularly those with no sons
yet. The sharpest discrimination is by the

open birth interval: most of those in need
are in the active childbearing stage, either
pregnant or with a young infant.

2.—Statistics on unmet need should
go beyond simple percentages in need
among subgroups of couples. High percentages may give false signals since the
subgroup in question may be quite small
and constitute a tiny fraction of the population in question.

3.—The most disadvantaged segments
of the population, however, have both
high percentages and large numbers: the
rural and agricultural groups, and especially those in the South. They, and the
one-third of the population with little or
no formal education, have little access to
modern contraception except through the
formal program, which however offers
them chiefly only one method.

4.— Some of the unmet need group are
not really in need: those older couples
with older children who know they are
unlikely to conceive again and so use no
method. Survey measures of infecundity
sometimes fail to exclude these couples,
many of whom help compose the group
that does not intend to use.

5.—There is much evidence of a large
market for increased contraceptive use.
The following points argue for considerable latent interest: (1) Substantial proportions of couples have had more children
than they desired. At ages above 30, from
one in seven to nearly one in two couples
have more children than desired. This has
occurred even in the presence of extensive
use of abortion and menstrual regulation
in the Vietnam system. (2) Some 1.2 million to 1.4 million procedures of abortion

Social Biology

or menstrual regulation have been occurring annually, or about 13 per cent of married women (Goodkind, 1994). This volume, cumulated over say three years,
encompasses a remarkable share of reproductive age women, even after removal of
duplications.

6.—Contraception is already used by
nearly 70 per cent of couples with two
children and at least one son, and by
60-65 per cent of all married women
aged 30-44—clear evidence of the extensive public awareness and knowledge levels already present. Important barriers to
enlarged contraceptive use and to the reduction of unmet need clearly rest on the
supply side, and these are more amenable
to implementation than are additional efforts to increase demand beyond the vigorous ones already operating.

7.—Unmet need, by a range of definitions, exists among one-sixth to over onefourth of couples, without counting categories such as traditional-method users,
dissatisfied users, abortion cases, or unmarrieds. Such enlargements add to the
absolute numbers considered to be in

helped by program improvements, including especially a wider method mix.
