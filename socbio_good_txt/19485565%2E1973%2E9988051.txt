An Analysis of the
Genetics of Schizophrenia

Hypotheses put forward to explain the
inheritance of schizophrenia include at
least: (1) a one dominant gene, (2) a one
recessive gene, (3) a two gene, and (4) a
polygenic theory (see Rosenthal, 1970, for
a summary). Uncertainties in the diagnosis
and variability of expression of the disease
lead to difficulties in attempting to decide
among these hypotheses and have led many
to consider schizophrenia as a heterogeneous
disease. The main complicating factor
seems, however, to be the existence of important environmental contributions whose
presence is clearly documented, but whose
nature remains largely uncertain.

The magnitude of environmental effects
is such that disbelief or minimization of the
role of inheritance in schizophrenia is not
uncommon. Evidence in favor of a genetic
component comes from two sources: (1)
the concordance in monozygotic twins,
which ranges from 14% to 79% in eleven
different studies (see Rosenthal, 1970), but
is practically always higher than that in
dizygotic twins (ranging from 2% to
15%); and (2) by corroborating adoption
studies of the progeny of a schizophrenia
parent (Heston, 1966; Kety et al., 1968),

Haven, Connecticut,

 

and a small number of MZ twins brought
up apart. The evidence thus speaks in favor
of an important genetic contribution; on
the other hand, the relatively low concordance of MZ twins clearly points out
that the role of environmental differences is
also important. The relative contribution of
genetic and environmental factors remains
to be assessed.

In spite of a confusing situation, the test
of genetic hypotheses may be useful, provided the importance of the environment is
duly considered. We have been interested
in retesting the two extreme hypotheses, the
one gene and the polygenic models, using
in both cases the threshold approach. One
assumes that every genotype has a given
expectation (i.e., mean) of liability to manifest the disease with a distribution of liability around the mean which is entirely of
environmental origin. In either model, the
environmental variation is assumed to be
independent of the genotype; thus, we ignore genotype-environment interaction.
Only those individuals whose liability, resulting from the joint effects of genetic and
environmental factors, is above a certain
threshold value will express the disease.

In the case of the polygenic model, the
overall distribution of the liability is assumed to be normal, resulting from the

schizophrenia by Gottesman and Shields
(1967) using the approach of Falconer
(1965). The same threshold approach can
be applied to the single gene model (see
Figure 2). A figure similar to Figure 1 is
given by Motulsky (1970) to explain some
congenital malformations on the basis of a
single locus with multiple alleles. We have
simplified the approach by using only two
alleles with which there are already four
parameters to be fitted to the data. These
parameters are the environmental variance,
e*, which is assumed to be the same for all
genotypes and is responsible for the three
normal distributions of Figure 2; the gene
frequency, g; the position of the threshold
on the scale of the trait, 7; and the position
of the heterozygote relative to that of two
homozygotes, “’.

THE SINGLE GENE MODEL

We have chosen to use the data in Rosenthal (1970), taken from tables presented

seem, however, to alter substantially the
means. Table 1 gives a simple statistical
analysis of these data. The high heterogeneity of available studies is immediately
apparent. Most x? values between studies
are significant, even though some x? are
underestimated by the use of the number
of probands instead of the number of
children.

In view of the significance of most heterogeneity y”, standard errors of the observed
percentages were computed from the bi
nomial values, multiplied times \/y?/df if
y? were significant. This corresponds to
using an ordinary weighted standard error
for cases of significant heterogeneity. This
heterogeneity at once makes the analysis
difficult and throws doubt on the possibility
of using more exact methods of segregation
analysis, without selecting from the body of
data. Some sources of heterogeneity—the
variation in severity of the disease and that

ferent authors—are clearly recognizable and
are discussed by Rosenthal (1970) in some
detail. In the tabulation of MZ and DZ
twins, for instance, the outcome of studies
is given by a low and a high figure, usually
depending on the severity of the criterion
employed. The same is true of the S&S
data. We have therefore computed two
means—one from the low values and one
from the high values—whenever a choice of
values is indicated in the tables by Rosenthal. The two figures are indicated by the
subscripts / and # respectively.

Further uncertainties arise from the large
and significant discrepancy between the frequency of schizophrenia in parents of
schizophrenic offspring, ascertained through
the offspring (P/O = 4.4%), and the frequency of the disorder in offspring of one
schizophrenic parent (N X S= 12.8%).
Many explanations have been offered in the

 

literature. We have used these two estimates, however, as low and high limits in
Table 2, although clearly the explanation is
likely to be different from that of low and
high values in other cases. The expectations
for the two types (P/O and N XS) are,
under a one gene model, very close, and if
anything that for N X S is smaller.

Still a third source of heterogeneity both
within classes and between classes is the
inclusion of some risk values that have not
been age corrected and others that have
been age corrected. In particular, the values
for S < S computed for the Rosenthal table
are not age corrected, while those for N X
S are. Erlenmeyer-Kimling (1968) gives
age corrected values for S XS which are
higher and are included in Table 2 for
comparison.

The high heterogeneity observed throws
doubt on the usefulness in this case of the

usual tests of goodness of fit. However, a
crude analysis can be made by considering
both the high and low values calculated in
Table 1 and comparing them with expectations. The relevant observed frequencies
taken from Table 1 are given again in the
first two lines of data in Table 2. The expected frequencies for the one gene model
are computed for a test range of values of
the four parameters, e, J, g, and hk’. Expectations were computed on the basis of the
conditional probability matrices of Li and
Sacks (1954).

We have preferred to explore a large fraction of the whole parameter space by fairly
gross increments of the parameter values so
as to search for possible local maxima of the
goodness of fit, rather than exploring more
accurately a smaller fraction of the parameter space but leaving a large fraction of it
unexplored (see Cavalli-Sforza and Kidd,
1972), since the heterogeneity of the data

raises doubts about the validity of any test
of goodness of fit. Specifically, we considered the full range of dominance from completely recessive through no dominance to
completely dominant.

This model therefore encompasses most
of the previously proposed single gene
models, including the recessive model of
Kallmann (1938) and the partially dominant model of Slater (1958). Our results
are closest to those of Garrone (1962). The
main criterion we have used in selecting the
sample of four sets of parameter values
given in Table 2 is that the expectations
computed on their basis are all within two
S.E. from the high or low observed values.
Two minor exceptions are the U/N value
which in two cases deviates by almost three
S.E., but is probably of no great relevance,
and the DZ value which deviates by slightly
over two S.E. in one case. A further restriction on the computation that we have im

posed is that the general incidence, computed on the basis of the parameter values,
had to lie between 0.8 and 2%. The examples in Table 2 are not exhaustive, but are
representative of many sets satisfying these
criteria.

Without attempting a more precise fit,
which may be a useless exercise for a variety
of considerations already mentioned, the
sets of parameters satisfying the imposed
restrictions all indicate an essentially recessive gene: h’, the expected liability of the
heterozygote is less than the mean of the
expected liability values for the two homozygous types. The gene frequency is around
10% or higher. The threshold is such that
50% or more of the homozygous recessives
would manifest the disease. Table 3 gives

expected while those for DZ co-twins or
sibs are smaller; (2) expected values for
S>S lie between the age-corrected and
non-age-corrected values; and (3) expected
values for P/O-N & §S are closer to the incidences ascertained through affected children. All these deviations are in agreement
with a schizophrenic effect of a schizophrenic close relative, a factor not included in
the model. One other possible factor is the
greater similarity in environments of MZ
twins.

It is interesting that Elston and Campbell (1970) have analyzed a model which,
although formally different, can be considered equivalent to the above one. They also
have four parameters, the gene frequency
and a penetrance for each genotype, that

the penetrance of each genotype for each
set of parameters and the proportions of all
schizophrenics that would belong to each
genotypic class. Schizophrenics would be
mostly, but not entirely, homozygous recessives according to this model. In particular,
between 13% and 25% of all schizophrenics would have the homozygous normal
genotype and manifest the disease only because of environmental factors; they might
be called phenocopies. Thus, a single-gene
threshold model predicts a heterogeneous
etiology for schizophrenia.

It may be noted that the differences between the data and the expectations seem
consistent over the four sets: (1) observed
values for MZ co-twins are larger than the

can be converted into the parameters used
by us. Although they have used a smaller
and selected body of data (by only one
author), so that the data they use differ
from ours, our conclusions are in agreement
with theirs, and the estimates they obtain
are not excessively different from ours.

Heritability can be computed for a set of
parameter values by first calculating the
genetic variance from the formula:

Va = 2pq[h(1 — 26q) — 4h’?
+ 29(1+ 9)]

which is easily derived from the value scale
used for #’ and the genotypes given in
Table 2. Heritability in the broad sense is
then calculated as H = Vg/(Ve -+- ce). The

260

heritability estimates for the four sets of
parameter values are 13.6%, 11.6%, 11.6%,
and 15.0%.

Finally, a recessive gene 1s in agreement
with a higher incidence in the progeny of
consanguineous matings as observed in a
few sets of data (see Rosenthal, 1970). It
should be noted, however, that a recessive
gene with such a high frequency is expected
to show, even if fully penetrant, a rather
modest increase in the frequency of consanguineous parentage.

Before considering the polygenic model,
we should emphasize the simplifying assumptions in the single gene threshold
mode]. We assumed the environmental variation to have the same variance for each
genotype and to be normally distributed;
we assumed only two alleles in HardyWeinberg equilibrium; we have considered
only presence versus absence of schizophrenia. As will be discussed later, this latter
simplification applies also to the polygenic
model. These assumptions are useful in
simplifying the treatment of the data, but
are recognized as limiting the validity of
the description thus obtained. It does not
incorporate all potential variables, but at
least considers those that are likely to be of
greatest importance.

THE POLYGENIC MODEL

Even greater difficulties are encountered
in attempting an exact fit of the polygenic
model. As already mentioned, Gottesman
and Shields (1967), who first used it in
schizophrenia, employed the approach introduced by Falconer (1965) to explain diabetes and other diseases on a polygenic
basis. This approach (see Cavalli-Sforza
and Bodmer, 1971) is highly approximate,
and the suggestion by J. Edwards (1969)
to employ tetrachoric correlation coefficients
seems far more satisfactory. The latter is
exact as long as the underlying distributions
are normal. Edwards gave a graph for esti

mating the tetrachoric correlations from
observed data and also an empirical formula to approximate the values obtainable
from the exact tetrachoric correlation.
Heritabilities (or more precisely correlations) above 80%, in the range indicated
by some of the most informative data in
schizophrenia, are not given in Edwards’s
graph.

Rather than using the approximation,
especially in this higher range, we have
computed the true tetrachoric correlation
from the series expansion originally employed by Everitt (1910). We find these
correlations to be substantially higher than
those obtainable by Edwards’s empirical
formula, which appears to be a valid and
good approximation only within the range
in which his graph was drawn (see also
Mendell and Elston, 1971; Smith, 1970).
From these correlations we have computed
the heritabilities given in Table 4 from

the source of the discrepancy between N *

It is then divided by the genetic correlation, p, expected for the same type of relationship, to obtain the heritability. For MZ
twins, p is 1 (i.e., the heritability is equal
to the tetrachoric correlation). For DZ
twins, one has to make further assumptions
on dominance. Assuming no dominance,
p — ¥%, and the heritability is twice the
tetrachoric correlation. Values obtained are
given in Table 3, assuming, as Gottesman
and Shields (1967) did, two possible levels
of incidence of schizophrenia in the genera]
population.

The heritabilities obtained do not differ
much in the two sets of data. If the higher
incidence figures are correct, this fact may
reflect greater differences in environment of
DZ twins than of MZ twins. Further tests
of agreement can be made for the other
crosses. In particular, S * S seems interesting, but the computation of expectations
in this or other crosses, under the polygenic
model, raises new computational problems.
We have used in this case a Monte Carlo
approach which is described in detail elsewhere (Cavalli-Sforza and Kidd, 1972).
The outcome of the computations is given
in Table 5.

The incidence observed in S & S matings
seems somewhat lower than expected, suggesting a heritability below 80%, while data
in Table 4 suggest a higher heritability.
This difference is not large and may be
mostly due to the simplicity of our simulation. We make no allowance for correlations

between environment and genotype or for
interactions between the two. Matthysse
and Shortliffe (1972) have considered two
possible explanations: assortative mating
among schizophrenics and a positive correlation between the total liability (environmental and genetic) of the parents and the
environmental contribution to the liability
of the offspring. They have shown that including such factors in the simulation
results in much better agreement with the
observed levels of incidence. Thus, it would
seem that a polygenic model also cannot be
ruled out.

DISCUSSION

The sources of heterogeneity discussed
make it unlikely, but not impossible, that
more precise methods of segregation analysis, employing individual family data, may
reach more substantial conclusions. At any

262 Kidd and Cavalli-Sforza

rate, it seems difficult on the basis of the
present analysis to discard either the one
gene model or the polygenic model or both.
We are thus in agreement with the supporters of either theory. Elston and Campbell (1970) did not fit a two-gene version
of their model to the data, but we think
that a two-gene threshold model could fit
the data. In fact, since either extreme version, single gene or polygene, can account
for the observed data, it seems intuitively
likely that any intermediate version, in particular, the two-gene model, would also give
a satisfactory fit to the present data. The
same can be said for any model of genetic
heterogeneity, since an increase in the number of parameters can only improve the fit.

Both of these threshold models, single
gene and polygene, consider schizophrenia
as an all or nothing disease; this is a great
oversimplification. Heston (1970) has considered the possibility that there is essentially a continuum from normal to schizophrenic. There is, in addition, a gradient in
severity among schizophrenics, and the concordance rate among twins has been shown
to be positively correlated with the severity
of the index cases (see Gottesman and
Shields, 1967; Rosenthal, 1970). However,
both models are based on an underlying
continuous variable. Thus, there is no conceptual difficulty involved in subdividing
this continuum into many segments corresponding to the types and degrees of severity in a schizoid spectrum, but the quality
of the data do not seem to warrant the
estimation of many separate thresholds at
this time.

The correlation between concordance and
severity has been used to support the polygenic model (Gottesman and Shields,
1967), but, in itself, it cannot discriminate
between the two threshold models. Elston
and Campbell (1970), relying on the large
environmental effect, suggested the shared
environment of twins was a plausible explanation. For threshold models, as here for
Social Biology

mulated, it is mot necessary to invoke
environmental correlations to account for
this observation. It is only necessary to
postulate that the more severely affected
individuals are higher on the liability scale
to see that, by either model, these individuals thereby have a higher probability of
being schizophrenic because of a schizophrenic genotype than the more mildly affected individuals. Concordance rates would
thus be correlated with severity on either
model.

The severity-concordance correlation already mentioned points out a possibly significant source of heterogeneity among
studies. Thus, twin studies based on resident hospital patients have higher concordance rates than those based on general
population surveys (Rosenthal, 1961;
Gottesman and Shields, 1966). Future work
on the single gene model presented here
should include an attempt to fit the data
separately for each type of study, thereby
eliminating this source of heterogeneity.
Should we find that only the threshold need
be varied to account for the differences between the types of studies, it would be
strong support for the threshold model but
would not necessarily favor the single gene
or polygenic versions.

There are three other considerations
which emerge from this analysis which may
be worth further comment. The first is that,
if we cannot at this stage discard either a
one gene hypothesis or a polygenic hypothesis, the former is more attractive, both because it is favored from the application of
Occam’s razor and also because it gives
more hope of resolution in simple biochemical terms. Eventually, the answer to such
complex cases of inheritance will be in the
hands of biochemical researchers. Whichever the answer, it is more gratifying at this
stage to think that there is no real evidence
yet, against the hope that the answer may
be relatively simple (i.e., that there is one
major locus, though greatly complicated by

Vol. 20, No. 3

environmental effects). If the data force us
to accept a truly polygenic hypothesis, the
explanation in physiological or biochemical
terms is unlikely to be as simple. Naturally,
a great number of alternatives to the simple
one-recessive-allele or the simple polygenic
hypothesis remain available. The multiplication of parameters would improve the fit,
but the acceptability of any of these more
complex hypotheses would remain, at the
moment, scarcely greater than that of any
other explanation.

Another consideration refers to the values
of heritability thus computed. The same set
of data analyzed as a polygenic system
yields a heritability of 80% or higher, but
as a one gene system, it yields values that
vary from 10% to 15%. Thus, on one
hypothesis, the role of genetics (as defined
by the heritability concept) is more important. The two theories fit almost equally
well—or equally poorly—the data, but well
enough that both theories have been accepted by competent, though different, research workers. Should one attach much
meaning to a quantity such as heritability
which may fluctuate so widely depending
on the genetic hypotheses employed, and
among which, at this stage, it seems to be
difficult to make a firm choice?

Finally, it may be mentioned that if the
one gene hypothesis is correct, then the gene
predisposing toward schizophrenia should
be considered an essentially recessive gene
of relatively high frequency (of the order of
10% or higher) although there may be
some affected persons who are of the heterozygote type, and some of the homozygotes
for it may be normal. Schizophrenics would
be in fact of all possible genotypes, though
predominantly (about 70%) of the homozygous recessive type.

Genetics of Schizophrenia

SUMMARY

Data on the inheritance of schizophrenia
indicate that both genetics and environment contribute in an important way to the
manifestation of the disease. However,
heterogeneity of the data makes an accurate
analysis very difficult. For this reason, the
solution is unlikely to come from statistical
techniques alone. Future advances in physiological, toxicological, and biochemical research are more likely to supply a firmer
basis to the understanding of the genetic
component of this disorder. A crude analysis of a threshold model, using a polygenic
or a single gene hypothesis, shows that both
are in approximate agreement with the data.

Though argument about genetic models
seems futile when virtually any model can
account for the data, the single gene hypothesis is unavoidably more attractive at
this stage. If a single gene is involved, the
allele predisposing toward schizophrenia
should be considered as essentially, though
not entirely, recessive; all genotypes would
be strongly affected by unknown environmental factors; and even some genetically
normal individuals would manifest the disorder,

Addenda

Since this paper was written, some articles
that relate to this topic have appeared or are
in press now and have been brought to our
attention. James (1971) has shown that in the
one gene model with one threshold, the correlations between relatives depend only on three
parameters. Both the single gene model studied
by Elston and Campbell (1970) and the model
we used require four parameters for complete
specification. This leaves a range of equally
valid solutions, among which general incidence
and incidence among various types of relatives
are identical. The range is, however, restricted
by the fact that gene frequencies and penetrances outside the range 0-1 are unacceptable.

In the case of schizophrenia, the restriction
thus imposed limits the range of possible solutions to gene frequencies between approximately 0.06 and 0.15. In this range all solutions are equally acceptable. Thus, a single
gene two allele model can fit the data. If a
single locus is involved, the gene frequency
must be in the neighborhood of g=0.10 (with
range 0.06-0.15 by James’ approach). A very
similar range of solutions was found with our
search procedure and is indicated in Tables 2
and 3 of this paper.

Two aspects of some interest resulted from
the comparison of these approaches. The first
is that, while James used only the parentoffspring correlation, his conclusions can be
extended to the case in which specific types of
matings are considered, eg., N XN, N XS,
and S X S as we have done. The second is that
the two formulations of the single gene model
(ours based on liability distribution and James’
using scores of O for normal and 1 for disease)
give rise to different heritability estimates. Our
formulation allows direct calculation of the
additive and dominance components of variance for the underlying liability for each acceptable solution. Over the range of these
solutions the variance components vary, and
consequently the heritability estimates vary.
The A? (narrow) values range from less than
4% to slightly over 15%, while the A? (wide)
values range only from approximately 11% to
approximately 17%. In contrast, the invariant
heritability estimates based on application of
Kempthorne’s formulae (see James, 1971) are
near 8% for h? (narrow) and near 40% for
h? (wide).
