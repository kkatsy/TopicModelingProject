With the prodigious growth of medical
genetics during the past several decades, numerous new ‘‘subspecialties” have evolved,
such as molecular genetics, dermatoglyphics, Immunogenetics, and pharmacogenetics; undoubtedly, many more will appear.
Thus, a human geneticist investigating a
particular genetic trait or disease in one or
more kindreds has a potential wealth of
highly specialized genetic consultants available to him. However, the obvious problem
with which he is immediately confronted is
how to locate these specialists, or more
precisely, ‘‘Who is doing what and where?”’
Because of this dilemma, we decided to formulate a world-wide medical genetics information source, listing the units, their directors, and their available special services.
We therefore compiled an International Directory of Genetic Services, which was published under the auspices of The National
Foundation in May, 1968.

Reference sources for the Directory included the following: (1) the roster of the
American Society of Human Genetics;

49

(2) the rosters of certain genetic societies in
Europe and Asia; (3) previous publications
of lists of genetic clinics in the United States;
(4) information from the Human Genetics
Units of the World Health Organization;
(5) questionnaires which were completed at
the Third International Congress of Human
Genetics held in Chicago in September,
1966; (6) the list of Birth Defects Centers of
The National Foundation; (7) catalogues of
all medical schools indicating any type of
identification with medical genetics; and (8)
correspondence with colleagues throughout
the world. Questionnaires, with space allocated for recording identifying information,
services offered, and other units known to
them in their own area or nearby countries,
were sent to these geneticists and to the directors of genetics units.

As available services were ascertained, an
extensive list of genetic services was drawn
up. This list was later culled to incorporate
only major headings (Table 1). Correspondence following publication of the Directory
has indicated a need to include several

additional services in the next edition.

The major objective of the International
Directory of Genetic Services is to expedite
the dissemination and exchange of epidemiologic, medical-genetic, socioeconomic, and
genealogic information pertaining to hereditary disorders. For example, medical-genetic
information involving newly-described hereditary syndromes can often be elucidated
through the accumulation of medical data

and England, and others in Ohio, Illinois,
Nebraska, and California, an investigator
might decide that the accumulation of
genetic data is an insurmountable problem.
However, through use of the Directory, he
may correspond with geneticists from the
several locations and through the exchange
of information regarding these relatives, he
might add significantly to scientific knowledge from an in-depth investigation. Our

on the greatest number of ascertainable
family members. Knowledge of the full
spectrum of clinical variations in a particular
hereditary syndrome could provide insight
into its pathogenesis and could aid in its
classification. However, because of extensive
population mobility and migration, particularly in Western culture, it is not always
possible for one investigator to accumulate
complete family data. For instance, if a
proband resides in New York and some of
his relatives live in Germany, Denmark,

correspondence has indicated that this objective is now being realized; hopefully, it
will come to fruition in many important
genetic studies. Sharing of genetic information not only advances scientific knowledge
among the units involved, but also could
contribute to humanitarian needs through
provision of genetic counseling services.

As an illustration of the above points, we
recently had an opportunity to assist a colleague with a family investigation. Specifically, we received a telephone call from a

geneticist in Seattle, Washington, who is
studying creatinine phospho-kinase in a
family with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Through use of the Directory, he located our
unit and, in the spirit of its stated objectives, requested our cooperation in securing
blood samples from three family members
living in the Omaha area. We, of course,
complied and, in a small but potentially
significant way, facilitated his study.

The value of the International Directory of
Genetic Services will be directly related to the
completeness of its listings. We were well
aware that the information gathered for the
first edition of the Directory would be incomplete and we regret omissions and errors.
We realized, however, that following its

publication, investigators would advise us
of inaccuracies and omissions. Therefore, we
shall welcome additional information concerning names and addresses of units from
the readers of this journal so that the next
edition will be more complete. Such correspondence should be addressed to: Henry T.
Lynch, M.D., Chairman, Department of
Preventive Medicine and Public Health,
Creighton University School of Medicine,

68131. The Directory, itself, may be obtained from:
