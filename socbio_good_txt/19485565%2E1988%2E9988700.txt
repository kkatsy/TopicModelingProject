The Season-of-Birth Paradox

ABSTRACT: Vital statistics data show a remarkably consistent seasonality in U.S. birth
patterns, with peaks in late summer and winter months, and a valley in the spring. An attitude
survey of college students suggests that peaks in the actual birth distribution occur in unpopular
months in which to give birth; the valley in the actual birth distribution occurs in popular
months. This paradoxical finding is named the Season-of-Birth Paradox. Explanations to
resolve the paradox include biological and psychological components. A psychological
mechanism—named the Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis—is tested using NSFG data
from the 1973-75 and 1979-81 cycles. Results suggest that women stop contracepting with the
expectation that they will get pregnant almost immediately. When it takes several months on
the average for a successful conception to occur, the actual birth distribution is shifted away
from the preferred birth distribution. These results suggest that psychological as well as

biological mechanisms underlie the consistent seasonality patterns in U.S. births,

There has been recent attention in
the demographic literature to seasonality patterns in United States birth and
death data (e.g., Land and Cantor,
1983; Seiver, 1985). Explanatory
models of the observed seasonality patterns have been proposed for many
years. Most of these have had biological
bases. The present research focuses on
social and psychological processes to explain the seasonality in U.S. birth data.
First, the seasonality patterns in U.S.
birth data will be identified, and previous explanations of those patterns will
be reviewed. Following, two empirical
data sets will be presented, which, together, identify the Season-of-Birth
Paradox. Explanations to help resolve
the paradox will be proposed. We will
focus on a psychological explanation we
call the Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis, which implies a formal

decision-making model of fertility be
havior. Finally, we test this hypothesis

using National Survey of Family
Growth data from Cycles IT and III.

BIRTH SEASONALITY

Seasonality in human births has been
noted repeatedly in studies of aggregate
birth patterns. U.S. data from the past
fifty years and even before have been remarkably consistent in showing a major
birth peak in the late summer (AugustSeptember) and a minor peak in the
winter (December-February). At least
as remarkable, but less noted, is the
depth of the birth valley in April that has

been consistently found also. Data sup
porting this seasonality pattern are numerous and include those coming from
Baltimore (Pasamanick et al., 1960), a
county in Georgia (Warren and Tyler,
1979), and U.S. Vital Statistics records
for 1933-63 (Rosenberg, 1966). Shimura et al., (1981) used data from the
northern United States and observed

171

172 Rodgers and Udry

these patterns as far back as 1741. Seiver
(1985) presented the most recent analysis of seasonality patterns in U.S. births.
He studied U.S. Vital Statistics data
from 1947 to 1976, for the U.S. as a
whole, and for geographic subregions.
In his introduction he calls the consistency in this pattern a “mystery” and a
“puzzle.”

Several possible explanations of the
season-of-birth patterns have been proposed. Notable among those include the
effect of weather and light patterns on
biological processes (triggered, perhaps, by the pineal gland; Ehrenkranz,
1983), and the effect of heat and nutrition on fetal and infant mortality patterns (Pasamanick et al., 1979). Sociological explanations have focused on the

aggregate correlation between SES and

seasonality patterns (e.g., Warren and
Tyler, 1979; Zelnick, 1969), with inconclusive results. Seiver (1985) proposed
two explanations. He extended previous
work investigating climatic effects, noting that differences between geographic
subregions and slight changes in the seasonality patterns between 1947 and 1976
support the hypothesis that heat plays a
role in the seasonality patterns. In particular, he invoked the onset of air conditioning in the 1950’s and the differential use of air conditioning across
subregions of the United States to successfully explain some of the patterns.
He also used research showing seasonality in male hormone production to show
a correspondence between hormone
patterns and birth patterns.

All mechanistic explanations of birth
seasonality have been biological (e.g.,
hormonal correlations, differential fetal
mortality). Most explanations, though,
have only given indirect evidence about
the specific mechanisms causing the seasonality patterns (e.g., weather pat
Social Biology

terns, SES levels). This paper will consider a direct social-psychological
mechanism—seasonality in birth planning—to explain seasonality in U.S.
births.

_ Udry and Morris (1967) considered
that coital frequency might vary seasonally. They did find seasonality patterns
among a small sample of women, but
the coital patterns did not predict the national birth patterns. Otherwise, social
and psychological mechanisms to help
explain these birth patterns have seldom
been considered in the demographic literature (but see Parkes, 1976). This
finding is surprising, given the careful attention researchers have devoted to
studying the way attitudes and preferences predict other types of fertility data
(e.g., Ryder and Westoff, 1965; Westoff
and Ryder, 1977). Or, perhaps it is not
surprising, given the paradoxical nature
of the relationship between seasonality
preferences and seasonality patterns
that we will now demonstrate.

THE SEASON-OF-BIRTH
PARADOX

The Season-of-Birth Paradox is the
name we have given to a result which is,
at first consideration, quite surprising.
The paradox is easily demonstrated by
reference to two sets of empirical data.

Figure 1 shows the seasonality patterns from U.S. Vital Statistics data
(National Center for Health Statistics,
1982), averaged across 1971-78. Two
portrayals are shown, a typical histogram of the data, and a rose diagram (a
circular histogram which more correctly
models seasonality patterns, since the
cyclical nature of the data is explicitly
portrayed; Mardia, 1972). The pattern
in these data is the same as that from
Rosenberg (1966) and Seiver (1985),

about marniage and birth plans and expectations. The questions relevant to
this research were the following:

1. What do you think the best month in
which to give birth to a child would be?
Why?

2. What do you think the worst month in
which to give birth to a child would be?
Why?

In Figures 2.and 3, the histogram and
rose diagram of responses to these questions are shown. The “best month” distribution was unimodal, with a peak in
April and May. The “worst month” distribution was bimodal, with a peak in
July-August and December-January.

The reasons that respondents gave
for their choices were predictable. Fiftyfour per cent chose the best month
based on a seasonal preference (usually
for spring). Fourteen per cent chose
their favorite month because of moderate weather. For the “worst month”
choices, 62 per cent chose the month
they did because the weather is too hot
or too cold. An additional 13 per cent
chose December as a month to avoid because of Christmas. While the external
validity of these data is questionable (as
in any college student sample), the
choices and reasons for those choices
are rational and are certainly ones that
would occur to a population of couples
making childbearing decisions. Later in
this paper, we will present data from a
national probability sample that support
the external validity of the findings from
this college student sample.

When the patterns in Figures 2 and 3
are combined with those from Figure 1,
the Season-of-Birth Paradox is readily
apparent. The most popular months in
which to give birth correspond to the actual birth valley. The least popular
months in which to give birth correspond to the actual birth peaks.

Social Biology

EXPLANATIONS OF THE
SEASON-OF-BIRTH PARADOX

A number of possible explanations
were proposed to resolve the inconsistency between the patterns in the actual
and preferred distributions. These fall
into three general categories:

1. The Bad Data Hypothesis;

2. The Biological Domination HypotheSiS;

3. The Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis.

The Bad Data Hypothesis suggests
that the paradox is artifactual, that in
fact preference and actual birth patterns
do match. If one felt most couples actually planning births were systematically
different in their preferences from college students, that in fact they held exactly the opposite preferences from the
college students in our sample, that furthermore they preferred hot, cold, and
Christmas months in which to give birth
and desired to avoid spring, this hypothesis would be attractive. We reject such
an argument on logical grounds. We will
ultimately reject this argument on empirical grounds later in this paper.

The Biological Domination Hypothesis suggests that, regardless of couples’
preferences and behaviors reflecting
those preferences, biological processes
not under volitional control cause the
seasonality patterns in U.S. births. We
will not argue with this hypothesis in any
fundamental way. We assume that there
are such biological bases (related to hormonal patterns, the pineal gland,
weather patterns, fetal mortality patterns, etc.) underlying the seasonality in
U.S. birth data. We do propose, however, that volitional fertility decisionmaking can act alongside such nonvolitional biological processes.

they often decide to postpone immediate childbearing, and to contracept. At
some point, if they want a family, they
stop contracepting.! Such a decision

'Miller (1986) has developed a forma! theoretical framework that defines such “‘procepting” behavior.

will be based on factors relevant to the
decision makers, and we propose that
the seasonality of birth is one such factor that some couples may choose to
consider. If they do so, the pattern of
seasonality with which they stop contracepting should contain information
about their seasonality preferences.

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

Our model proposes that many couples expect a pregnancy almost immediately, and that they stop contracepting
with that expectation. This proposal
suggests examination of the seasonal
distribution with which couples stop
contracepting. Specifically, if this distribution is lagged by ten months, it
should approximately match their preference distribution. But pregnancy is
not always attained immediately. If it
takes several months, on the average,
for a couple to conceive, then the distribution with which they stop contracepting will not match their preference distribution. Furthermore, the stopping
contraception distribution, when
lagged by thirteen or fourteen months,
should approximately match the actual
birth distribution.

There is some empirical support for
the belief that lag to pregnancy may be
considerably underestimated. Foreit
and Foreit (1981) asked a sample of college students to estimate the probability
that one unprotected coital act between
a healthy 20-year-old male and a 19year-old female would result in a pregnancy. The median response was 0.50
(mean = 0.42), compared to an estimated actual value of 0.04 (e.g., Bongaarts, 1976). Over 80 per cent of this
sample reported having engaged in sexual intercourse, so this was a sexually experienced (though not sexually educated) sample. Furthermore, Hendershot (1982) found that studies using clinically measured lag-to-pregnancy
showed longer lags than those using retrospective reports. Underestimation
may well be both a prospective and retrospective phenomenon.

This mistaken belief is exactly the
mechanism used by the Misinformed
Reproducer Hypothesis to help resolve
the Season-of-Birth Paradox. The predictions of the model that contraception

177

stopping will be related to seasonal birth
preferences, with a longer-than-expected lag to pregnancy, will be tested using
a national probability sample of women
who gave birth between 1973 and 1981.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A TEST OF THE MISINFORMED
REPRODUCER HYPOTHESIS: THE DATA
AND THE METHOD

Data to test this hypothesis came
from the National Survey of Family
Growth (NSFG), Cycles II and III. The
NSFG is a stratified, weighted probability sample of women aged 15-44 in the
United States. The particular subjects of
interest were 1,919 currently married
women who gave birth during 1973-75
and 1,176 who gave birth during 197981 (total N = 3,095). For these women,
contraceptive, birth planning, and pregnancy histories were available. The seasonality patterns for each relevant analysis were defined by observing the
distribution of the event across months.

Two adjustments were made in the
data. First, the raw data were weighted
according to sampling rates, so that they
may be considered representative of the
general population of U.S. women. Second, the monthly data were adjusted for
length of month. The monthly rates
were computed by dividing the actual
number of events during a month by the
expected number, which was defined as
the total births in the year multiplied by
the ratio of days in the month to days in
the year. This index is based on the annualized birth rate defined in Shryock et
al. (1976, p. 277; also see Land and Cantor, 1983). Seiver (1985) used a similar
measure, except that he computed a
moving average across the 12-month
period centered on the particular
month, to eliminate trend contamina

tion. Since we had only six years of data
(with a gap in the middle), we could not
use such a moving average technique
(nor was distortion due to trend as much
of a concern as in his thirty years of continuous data).

The birth seasonality patterns in this
overall data set were examined in a preliminary analysis to check the efficacy of
the probability sample. The same general patterns were obtained, with some
slight additional (and predictable)
noise. As before, the peaks were in the
late summer and winter months, and the
valley was in the spring. This supports
the external validity of the results we obtain from the NSFG data.

The NSFG questionnaire included
three questions that were used to test
the Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis. The first asked whether the respondent had been contracepting prior to
getting pregnant. The second asked in
what month she stopped contracepting.
The third asked whether the reason she
stopped contracepting was to get pregnant. Combining the information from
these questions, we constructed distributions indicating monthly patterns
with which women stopped contracepting, broken down by the purpose for
which they stopped contracepting. A total of 1,271 women (792 from 1973-75,
479 from 1979-81) reported that they
had stopped contracepting in a particular month for the purpose of getting
pregnant. An additional 620 women
(499 from 1973-75, 121 from 1979-81)
reportedly stopped contracepting for a
reason Other than to get pregnant. Note
that the remaining 1,204 women—39
per cent—from the original sample did
not respond to one or more of the relevant questions and could not be used in
these analyses. We presume that most
of these nonresponses were from

Social Biology

women who accidentally became pregnant, and therefore never stopped contracepting prior to pregnancy, or who
could not remember when they
stopped.

For statistical analysis, we used the
technique that Seiver (1985) described
and applied to his data. This method
uses dummy variable regression to test
for monthly deviations from uniformity
and for changes over time in those deviations. The technique involves constructing eleven dummy variables indicating whether an observation comes
from a given month or not (the twelfth
month is indicated by a pattern of all zeros). We also constructed an additional
dummy variable, indicating whether
the data came from the NSFG Cycle II
or Cycle III data, to test for changes in
the two cycles. When the period variable was multiplied by the eleven
monthly dummy variables, eleven additional dummy variables were defined
to test for changes across the two NSFG
cycles in each monthly pattern (a test of
a month by period interaction).

RESULTS

Figure 4 shows the seasonality with
which women in the NSFG data set
stopped contracepting for the purpose
of getting pregnant. This pattern is averaged across the six years of data. The
valley in this distribution is in FebruaryApril, with the major peak in June. In
the yearly data, every one of the six
years had its valley in February, March,
or April, and five of the six years showed
a peak in June. Thus, the patterns
shown in Figure 4 are consistent by year
across the time frame of the NSFG sample.

The dummy variable regression procedure described above was used to test

the reliability of these patterns. The first
test compared a 22 variable model with
11 monthly variables and 11 interaction
variables to the 11 variable model including only the monthly variables. This
test was nonsignificant, suggesting that
the monthly patterns were not significantly different between the two
NSFG cycles (i.e., variables reflecting
changes in the patterns did not contribute significantly to predictability).

The second analysis—and the critical
one for the test of our hypothesis—
involved testing each of the 11 monthly
dummy variables as it contributed to the
11 variable model. The overall model
showed significant stability (F = 3.7,
p <0.001). We note that the overall test
of the dummy variable regression model
is equivalent to the X-11 test that the
U.S. Bureau of the Census (1965) developed to test for overall stable seasonality.

The coefficients and t-tests from the
regression to test the months separately
are shown in Table 1. Net of the other

179

variables, the peak in June and the valley in February are significantly different from uniformity (p < 0.05), and the
continuations of the February valley
into March and April are marginally
significant (p < 0.10).? Thus, these particular peaks and valleys are not only
visually striking, they are stable enough
across the six years of the data to interpret statistically. This sample size is
quite small compared to other seasonality studies (e.g., Seiver used 30 years of
data in his analysis), resulting in low statistical power. For the patterns we observed to be statistically significant required considerable stability in the
results. Other patterns in Figure 4 (e.g.,
the minor peaks in October and January) are not distinct enough to interpret
as other than sampling fluctuations from
uniformity.

We might note that, following Seiver
(1985), we chose December as the “‘reference month” for our analysis. Strictly,
then, the tests are tests of deviation from
the December level, rather than from
exact uniformity. Since December (at
1.03) was quite close to 1.0, this is not
problematic. Each parameter coefficient gives a measure of deviation from
the level for December (which is indicated by the constant). Thus, for example, the February level is —0.34 from the
December level, and the f-tests shows
that this is a significant deviation from
that level.

We also constructed and examined

stopped contracepting for reasons other
than to get pregnant. There were no
monthly patterns across the six years,
and no months significantly deviated
from uniformity. Thus, it appears that a
different process is at work for women
who stop contracepting to get pregnant
than for those who stop for other reasons. The months of February-April
and June are not just extreme months in
which to stop contracepting in general.
Specifically, they are notable stop
months for. women trying to get pregnant.

We may use the monthly patterns of
contraception cessation in FebruaryApril and June to test the Misinformed
Reproducer Hypothesis. February,
March, and April are unpopular months
in which to stop contracepting. Under
the assumptions of our decision-making
model, women stop contracepting assuming they will get pregnant almost immediately. Ten months from FebruaryApril are the winter months Decem
ber-February. This is consistent with the
results from the survey of college students, who chose these months as especially unpopular ones (see Figure 3).
June, on the other hand, was avery popular month in which to stop contracepting. Ten months from June is April,
which was the overwhelming choice of
the college students as the preferred
month in which to give birth (see Figure
2). Thus, the pattern with which women
in the general U.S. population stop contracepting perfectly matches the preferences in the college student sample
(given the assumptions of the decisionmaking model).

In addition to predicting when
women stop contracepting, the Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis also
predicts a longer lag to pregnancy than
the expected one month. The effect of
this lag should be to move the valley of
the preference distribution (December-January) to the valley of the actual
birth distribution (April-May), and the

peak of the preference distribution
(April-May) to the peak of the actual
distribution (August-September).

In the NSFG data, the mean lag from
the time a woman stopped contracepting to get pregnant and a successful conception was almost five months. However, the median was 2.1 months,
indicating a positively skewed distribution. This distribution is shown in Table
2. The lag-to-pregnancy distribution for
women who stopped contracepting for
reasons other than to get pregnant was
nearly identical to this one.

If we consider only the mean lag to
pregnancy—without regard to the
whole distribution shown in Table 2—
there is an apparent full resolution of the
Season-of-Birth Paradox. A five-month
lag to pregnancy added to a nine-month
gestation results in an average fourteen
month waiting period before a woman

stopping contraception can expect to
give birth. A fourteen month lag in the
February-April valley predicts a birth
valley in April-June, which actually obtains (see Figure 1). The June peak predicts an August birth peak, which also
obtains.

However, Lam and Miron (1986)
noted that to resolve completely the
Season-of-Birth Paradox, we need not
only a mean, but also a median and
mode at five months. The pattern in Table 2 actually moves the distribution less
than five months and also causes a
dampening of the peaks and valleys.
When the distribution with which
women stop contracepting to get pregnant (Figure 4) is combined with the
whole lag to pregnancy distribution (Table 2) in a theoretical population of
women, we get the distribution shown in
Figure 5 as the predicted pregnancy dis

’In this survey, women indicated the month they stopped contracepting to get pregnant and the month in which they did get
pregnant. A woman indicating pregnancy in the same month in which she stopped contracepting had a lag between 0 and 1 month
long. In computing the mean and median, we assumed a lag of 0.5 for this category, 1.5 for those who got pregnant the month after

they stopped, etc. Since women don’t always have exact knowledge

of when they get pregnant, we speculate that their reports may

be based on their memory of how many times they menstruated after stopping contraception.

tribution. With an additional ninemonth gestation, the birth distribution
would show a valley in January-March,
and a peak in May-August.? Thus, the
resolution of the paradox is not complete. The birth distribution predicted
by the stopping contraception distribution is around two months short of
matching the spring valley and summer
peak in the actual birth distribution.

DISCUSSION

This paper was motivated by an interest in two research questions, one old
and one new. What causes the remarkably stable seasonal trends in U.S.
births? Why do the seasonal patterns of
actual births so perfectly contradict the
seasonal pattern of birth preferences?
We proposed a simple decision-making
model that can help answer both questions: Couples are rational fertility decision makers, but misinformed as to the
lag they can expect between their attempts at pregnancy and their success.
One prediction from this model is that
women will stop contracepting with a
pattern that predicts seasonal preferences. This was perfectly supported by
the analyses reported in this paper, in
which the seasonality with which
women stopped contracepting in one

3To construct this distribution, we simulated a
population of 1,000 women in which we applied
the empirical lag-to-pregnancy shown in Table 2 to
the distribution with which women stopped contracepting to get pregnant shown in Figure 4, assuming a uniform 9-month gestation period. We
note that the distribution in Figure 5 is not an empirical distribution, but rather shows in theory how
the observed lag to pregnancy can move the actual
birth distribution away from the preferred distribution. In an actual population, the distribution
for couples planning pregnancies would combine
with that for nonplanners, which would dampen
the peaks and valleys in Figure 5.

sample perfectly matched the reported
preferences in another.’

A second prediction of the model is
that women stop contracepting in a pattern that will predict birth seasonality,
but with a longer lag than they expect.
This prediction was partially supported.
When the actual (rather than expected)
lag to pregnancy is taken into account,
around half of the difference between
the major peak and valley in the birth
and preference distributions is resolved.

Despite this less than perfect resolution of the Season-of-Birth Paradox, for
such a simple model to perform as well

‘Like the reviewers of this paper, we originally
viewed the results of a small college student sample with considerable skepticism (which skepticism
motivated the development of our Bad Data Hypothesis). We were quite encouraged, however, to
discover that the NSFG data contain a pattern
which matches that in the smaller sample. Furthermore, it was exactly the one predicted by our Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis. Nevertheless,
we hasten to note that we have found no general
data in which respondents explicitly indicated their
monthly birth preferences. Thus, we are left with
the logical argument that a small nonrepresentative sample’s explicit preferences perfectly match a
large representative sample’s inferred preferences.

as it did seems encouraging. Our results
suggest only that the Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis may not be able to
stand alone in resolving the paradox and
in explaining the birth patterns. There
are several plausible explanations of
why the resolution was not complete.
First we return to the Bad Data Hypothesis. The patterns in the NSFG data
have successfully refuted criticism of the
select nature of the original college student sample. Both the college student
sample and the national probability
sample strongly suggest that there do exist seasonal preferences for birth that
can affect behavior. However, we can
still question the reliability of the reported pregnancy histories. If the estimates based on retrospective reports of
lag-to-pregnancy from these women
who gave birth were consistent underestimates, for example, the Misinformed
Reproducer Hypothesis might be entirely correct and able to stand alone.

There are, in fact, strong arguments —

that the NSFG reports of lag-topregnancy may well be underestimates,
for at least two reasons. First, since our
sample contains only women who gave
birth, it excludes women who tried to
become pregnant but did not during the
period covered by the survey. Including
those from the NSFG survey who eventually became pregnant would increase
both the mean and median lag to pregnancy, although the effect on the overall
distribution of births is unknown. A second and more relevant reason to suspect underreporting of the lag-topregnancy comes from a comparison to
previous data on this issue. Hendershot
(1982) reviewed several studies looking
at pregnancy lag, and noted a range in
the per cent pregnant within twelve
months from 43 per cent to 92 per cent.
However, his analysis concluded that

Season-of-Birth Paradox

183

figures in the mid 70 per cent range were
“near the mark” (compared to 88.4 per
cent in our sample; thus, his estimate
suggests a longer lag than we found). He
also noted a longer lag-to-pregnancy
than we found in a smaller and different

_ subset of the NSFG Cycle II data. His
_mid 70 per cent estimate came from giv
ing stronger weight to studies conducted
in clinical settings, which must be rather
more accurate than the retrospective
personal reports in the NSFG data.
Thus, we are apparently being conservative when we state that the Misinformed
Reproducer Hypothesis only partially
explains the gap between the predicted
and actual birth distribution. We note
that retrospective underreporting of the
lag to pregnancy is quite consistent with
the basic tenant of the hypothesis, that
couples expect to get pregnant sooner
than they actually do on the average. If
the NSFG women are indeed underreporting this lag, it may be because they
retrospectively revise the sequence of
events to match this belief, in the same
way that they prospectively misperceived the correct lag-to-pregnancy
when they stopped contracepting. Thus,
the Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis may be even closer to providing both
a full resolution of the paradox and an
explanation of the seasonality patterns
than our data suggest.

Nevertheless, we do not reject biological explanations, even while our
data support social-psychological mechanisms. No matter how couples plan,
certain biological processes will attenuate predictions based on those plans.
Seasonality in fetal wastage or in gestational length, for example, could alter
the relationship between stopping contraception and ultimate births.

It is important to note that the Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis only

184 Rodgers and Udry

explains the behavior of couples who are
planning their children and who stop
contracepting to get pregnant. Clearly,
this is less than the full population.
These women accounted for slightly
over 40 per cent of the NSFG sample. If
all other women were giving birth uniformly, patterns in 40 per cent of the
childbearing population could certainly
cause seasonal effects.

We also note that we have not accounted for the mincr birth peak in the
winter months (primarily in December
and February). Two comments will help
explain this apparent shortcoming.
First, Seiver (1985) noted a trend over
the past thirty years suggesting this minor peak is disappearing. Second, some
previous analyses of the NSFG Cycle II
data (see Rodgers and Udry, 1985) are
suggestive that the late summer peak
may be primarily caused by births to
contraceptors, while the winter peak is
primarily caused by births to noncontraceptors. Thus, increased contraceptive
usage between 1947 and 1976 might help
explain the reduction in the winter peak
observed by Seiver. In any case, this
finding suggests that a decision-making

Social Biology

model involving the decision to stop
contracepting may not have the ability
to predict the late winter peak in births.

We conclude by noting that our
model has nothing to say about women
who get pregnant without having previously used contraception, or about contraceptive failure, or about nonplanners. Certainly many births fall into
these categories. That the observed seasonality patterns are so consistent in the
United States, yet different in other geographical and cultural settings, suggests
that mechanisms other than biological
processes may be operating. The Misinformed Reproducer Hypothesis offers a
plausible and empirically supported resolution of the Season-of-Birth Paradox
and of the consistent patterns found in
U.S. birth data.
