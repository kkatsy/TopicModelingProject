ABSTRACT: This report compares the 1977 genetic demographies of Colonsay and Jura, adjacent
yet isolated islands of the Scottish Inner Hebrides. Completed family analyses demonstrated that
the residents of Colonsay have higher fertility, shorter generation length, and longer female reproduction span than those of Jura. Based on oral genealogies of five to six generations, the natives of
Jura had a higher inbreeding coefficient (f= 0.0044) than did those of Colonsay (f= 0.0023). Each
set of natives mainly derives from small groups of “founding” ancestors. Founder effects in the
populations are transitory phenomena dependent upon population decline and the periodic emigra-.
tion of native families. With their small sizes, the maximum sampling errors due to random genetic
drift are +0.063 for Colonsay and +0.059 for Jura per generation. An unusual finding was that the
effective sizes of Colonsay and Jura exceed their respective breeding sizes. Today Colonsay and
Jura are former geographical isolates in dissolution through an increasing marital admixture with
immigrants. Human migration dictated in large part by Hebridean economics dominates the mi
croevolutions of Colonsay and Jura.

This report compares the 1977 genetic
demographies of Colonsay and Jura, adjacent islands of the southern Scottish Inner
Hebrides (Figure 1). Each concise data set
of nearly complete enumeration represents a population’s demographic response to its recent economic adaptation
of the island’s habitat. Having experienced uninterrupted declines in population size since 1841 (Figure 2 and Table 1),
these are small populations still undergoing considerable economic change that
produces measurable demographic microevolution.

As an interpretive base for ongoing
study in the historical demography and
human biology of Colonsay and Jura, this
research addresses a series of problematic
areas in the biological study of human
populations. Zubrow (1976, p. 16) insists
upon the “importance of collecting and
analyzing subnational groupings of datain
cultural, ethnic and racial categories.”

These compilations permit our demographic understanding of assimilation and
its genetic homogenization of indigenous
populations (e.g., Devor, 1980). For example, anthropologists need durable population data from the northern British
islands of native Gaelic-speakers, part of
the larger North Atlantic culture area
(Cofone, 1980). This lack of information
is particularly acute for the biological anthropology of Great Britain; Roberts et
al. (1979:391) has observed ‘‘how little information is available on inbreeding levels
in the [British] population.”

Given their continual population declines, Colonsay and Jura might each
qualify as a depreciated community. As
opposed to population growth and development, this phenomenon has attracted
little theoretical attention (Gallaher and
Padfield, 1980) and even less demographic
investigation (exceptions being Roberts
1968, 1973, 1979, and Clegg, 1977). Death

of any community shrinks the scope of human biocultural variation yet another increment.

Two other aspects of the Colonsay and
Jura studies are of theoretical interest.
The first is that few other demographic
studies of human populations have considered “‘multiple microevolutionary forces
simultaneously”’ but have concentrated a
priori upon one agent such as selection or
random genetic drift (Tripp-Reimer,
1980, p. 255). The second is the question
of whether ostensibly similar, or even
proximal, populations (e.g., island communities or enclaves of immigrants) demographically evolve in similar fashion
(Tripp-Reimer 1980, p. 262). The com
parative genetic demographies of Colonsay and Jura demonstrate how external
factors (such as economics and related migration) can supersede internal factors
(such as inbreeding) in the structures of
contemporary isolates.

Fix (1977, p. 709) observed that “‘much
classical population genetics theory
tended to sacrifice realism for the advantages of generality and mathematical
tractability.”” Human population geneticists now appreciate how new, unusually
complete sets of demographic data and
their genetic implications best measure
departures from equilibrium, identify the
forces and rates of microevolution, and
hence aid development of more realistic

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Colonsay and Jura are dependent communities in the marginal economic area of
Highland Scotland. The industrialized
Lowlands utilize this region for taking
away “‘primary and extractive products”
later used in manufacturing and/or distributed in the cities. The Highlands and
islands have experienced many “boomand-bust cycles’? depending upon
Lowland and English markets and investment (Prattis, 1979, pp. 361—362; cf. Ennew, 1980).

Under one landlord (or laird), Colonsay still retains its traditional crofting
economy plus a direct ferry service from
Oban on the west Scottish mainland. Jura

has no direct transportation to the
mainland and only nominal ferry service
from the island of Islay to the west. It has
little crofting due to a paucity of arable
soil and maintains the more wage-based
economy through a distillery and five
lairds’ estates. The Highlands and Islands
Development Board assists the maintenance of each community. As in the
past, Colonsay and Jura remain isolated
from one another; public transportation
does not exist between them.

With the cooperation of each island’s
physician, a demographic, genealogical,
and medical survey was conducted on Colonsay and Jura during the summer of
1977. Name, age, sex, birthplace, and residence were collected for every inhabitant
of each island. Additionally, interviews
and a private medical proforma gathered
native genealogies (later linked by common ancestry into one pedigree) and famDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

over its 23 square miles; Jura’s 146 square
miles contained 211 inhabitants linearly
distributed in villages along a 26—mile
road that follows its south and east coasts.

RESULTS
POPULATION COMPOSITION

Colonsay and Jura are composite populations of natives and immigrants. Complying with the population research of
Morton et al. (1977, p. 249) on Barra
island of the Outer Hebrides, this study
also defined a native as one who has at
least one parent born on that island. This
operational definition excludes migrating
spouses but includes the offspring of spatially exogamous marriages. On Colonsay
and Jura such classification segregated the
Gaelic-speaking adults and immediately
prescribed a set of islanders who shared
close genealogical relationships. Figure 3,
with Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 4, with
Tables 4 and 5, present the respective pop

ulation pyramids and numerical compositions of Colonsay and Jura. Because human populations divide into three fertility
cohorts based upon capacity to reproduce
(Morton et al., 1971 p. 346), Tables 3 and
5 group the compositions into these age
cohorts from the usual ages of first-born
and last-born children of Colonsay and
Jura females.

Colonsay and Jura share some similarities in population composition. Each population has an average age in the late 30’s
(Colonsay, 38.0 + 23.6 years; Jura, 37.4 +
24.7 years) and an overall sex ratio slightly
in favor of females (Colonsay, 92.4M/
100F; Jura, 93.6M/100F). Each population divides nearly equally into the respec
tive fertility cohorts. The prereproductive
cohort is the smallest fertility cohort on
each island, possibly due to a small fertility dampening from the effective contraception now practiced by the women. The
postreproductive cohorts have the largest
proportions of native islanders because
emigration seldom occurs during these
years of life. |

The internal sex ratio of the separate
fertility cohorts follows a similar pattern
on both islands: the postreproductive cohort heavily in favor of females (Colonsay, 50-90+ , 76.0M/100F; Jura, 50-90+ ,
69.8M/100F), the reproductive cohort in
favor of males (Colonsay, 20-49, 114.3M/
100F; Jura, 20-49, 128.1M/100F), and the

The proportion of natives to migrants
portrays the principal contrast in composition between Colonsay and Jura. Colonsay has 81 of 127 (63.8 per cent) inhabitants with at least one parent born there—a
ratio of nearly 2:1 in favor of natives. Jura
has 74 of 211 (35.0 per cent) as native inhabitants—a ratio of 2:1 in favor of the migrants. The people of Colonsay have few
wage-based employments; a similarly traditional economy on Holy island, Northumberland, England, does not attract immigrants and 100 of the 175 (57.2 per cent)
inhabitants were still natives (Cartwright,
1973, p. 95). On the other hand, Jura’s five
estate owners compete for the tourist
trade during its autumn hunting season.
The estates frequently advertise on the
mainland to fill positions. The distillery
reopened in 1966 after a thirty-year closure to offer more jobs on the island. AIthough few native men of reproductive
age participate in the wage economy, it
has ample economic incentive for outsiders.

The varying opportunities for employment on Colonsay and Jura explain the
one irregularity in the population
pyramids: Colonsay’s deficiency of young
adults in the 20-29 age cohort. Many families of Colonsay have sons and daughters
who emigrated after their early exposure
to mainland life during high school. Recent emigrations for education and jobs

elsewhere involved 16 islanders 20-29
years of age (7M and 9F). If these young
adults now lived on Colonsay, its population pyramid would exhibit a graduation
of decreasing per cents through successive
age cohorts like the composition of Jura
with its wage economy. Emigration of the
young adults has been noted for declining
populations of Westray Island in the
Orkneys (Coull, 1966, pp. 71-74), St.
Kilda in the Outer Hebrides (Clegg, 1977,
pp. 296-299), Holy island, Northumberland (Cartwright, 1973, p. 107), and
Tory island, Donegal, Ireland (Fox, 1978,
pp. 18-19).

POPULATION NUMBERS

Since populations are neither infinite
nor constant in size, Wright (1931, 1938)
proposed a population’s “effective size”’
as its most meaningful unit of microevolution. To determine ‘‘effective size,’ one
must first enumerate the breeding size of
the census population. This can be the
number of individuals of reproductive age
or those in the population most likely to
contribute viable offspring to their succeeding generation. As previously presented, Colonsay and Jura each have
34-35 per cent of their populations in the
reproductive cohort of 20-49 years of age.
A more efficient measure of the breeding
size of a population is ‘‘the number of persons with children in the age of one

Vol. 27, No. 2

generation, i.e., from 0-30 years” (FreireMaia, 1974, p. 108). On Colonsay, 47
adults have children from 0-30 years old,
or 37.0 per cent of the population. Seventy
adults on Jura have children from 0-30
years old, or 33.2 per cent of the population.

The differences in their contribution of
gametes to the next generation among immediate parents will reduce the
population’s breeding size to its effective
size. Wright (1938) presented the formula

N,=(4N-2)/(V +2)
to calculate effective size based upon the
reproductive performances of immediate
parents in a population. In the formula, N
represents the number of immediate
parents and V is the variance in offspring
produced per individual. Typically, a population will show a higher variance than
mean in its offspring number, thus reducing the effective size to a still smaller segment than the breeding size (Bonne, 1963,
p. 85). If the variance of family size equals
its mean in a Poisson distribution, the effective size equals the breeding size
(Freire-Maia, 1974, p. 109). The effective
sizes for Colonsay and Jura were precisely
calculated by “‘taking all individuals who
were parents, ... counting their total
number of offspring, and then determin
ing the mean and deviation in numbers of

offspring for the total sample” (Swedlund,
1971, p. 15). This procedure accounts for
single immediate parents. The 47 Colonsay parents (22 couples and 3 single
parents) averaged 2.6 offspring/individual
with a variance of 0.92; the effective size is
63.7, or 50.6 per cent of the Colonsay population. The 70 parents of Jura (33 couples
and 4 single parents) have a mean of 2.4
offspring per individual with a variance of
1.75; the effective size equals 74.1, or 35.1
per cent of the Jura population.

The effective sizes on both Colonsay
(50.6 per cent of N) and Jura (35.1 per

Population Structure 121

cent of N) exceed their respective breeding sizes (Colonsay, 37.0 per cent of N;
Jura, 33.2 per cent of N) because the variance in gametic contribution of immediate
parents is smaller than its mean. FreireMaia (1974, pp. 108-109) remarks that ‘“‘a
few examples of this situation have been
found in man, but it has been impossible
to verify, up to now, whether they represent real situations or are simply due to
random fluctuation of estimates of the basic parameters.” Certainly effective contraception practiced by the island adults
reduces the natural variance of family size
to a socially and economically appropriate
number of children. On Jura the effective
size just slightly exceeds its breeding size
because the variance in adult contributions lies closer to the mean gametic contribution. The bulk of this variance comes
from three migrant parents contributing
far above the average number of offspring. Rather than inflating effective
size, the excessive fertility of these migrants increased a reproductive variance
that placed the effective size closer to the
breeding size of Jura. However,
Colonsay’s discrepancy between its breeding size and a much larger effective size
derives from a very low variance in adult
reproductive performance. Effective contraception in a tiny island population
without overwhelming immigration has
accomplished this unexpected situation.

MIGRATION, MARRIAGE, AND FERTILITY

Morton (1973, p. 334) believes that
“over a sufficiently small region, migration is a more important systematic pressure than mutation or selection.” Its quantity and directions vary from area to area
but seem especially susceptible to population density and economic opportunity afforded by available technology and transportation routes (Cavalli-Sforza and
Bodmer, 1971, p. 430). Table 6 displays

the numerical size and source of immigration to Colonsay and Jura, accounting for
every migrant over the extant generations. As discussed in population composition, the absolute number of migrants to
Jura as a proportion of its population is
nearly twice that proportion on Colonsay.
But the proportion and sources of immigration into Colonsay and Jura correspond. On each island the smallest yet
similar proportion of migrants comes from
neighboring Hebridean islands (Colonsay, 15.2 per cent of migrants; Jura, 11.0
per cent of migrants). Eachisland then has
an intermediate number of English migrants (Colonsay, 37.0 per cent of migrants; Jura, 32.1 per cent of migrants).
The largest proportion of migrants comes
from the Scottish mainland (Colonsay,
47.8 per cent of migrants; Jura, 56.9 per
cent of migrants), particularly from
Glasgow where transportation networks
originate.

Because “measuring the degree of endogamy is the relevant operation” in

definition of a population unit (Fix, 1979,
p. 210), Table 7 lists the spatial marriage
type for the reproductive and postreproductive couples on Colonsay and Jura. On
each island the majority of couples is in
the postreproductive generation. Unlike
many reported island populations (e.g.,
Freire-Maia and Cavalli, 1978), the majority of matings on Colonsay and Jura are
not endogamous. Although neither island
constitutes a rigorous breeding population, they differ in their respective degree
of departure from deme status. The proportion of marriages involving Colonsay
natives (25.0 per cent endogamy and 62.5
per cent exogamy, 87.5 per cent total)
doubles that proportion of marriages involving Jura natives (12.7 per cent endogamy and 31.8 per cent exogamy, 44.5 per
cent total). Exogamy is the most numerous type of marriage on Colonsay while
migrant couples prevail on Jura. The dissolutions of these two geographical isolates have followed similar patterns: The
rates of marital admixture have increased

between the two successive adult generations now living on each island. The postreproductive generations of Colonsay and
Jura show a majority of marriages involving natives through high exogamy. Colonsay has retained this trend in its reproductive generation but Jura has not. With
increasing immigration to the islands, the
next generations will not usually derive
from native inhabitants.

The completed family represents the
most vital unit of demographic analyses
when estimating potential microevolution
within and between human populations.
The analyses of fertility on Colonsay and
Jura use only couples from the postreproductive cohorts and couples from the reproductive cohorts who have not had a
child in more than five years as indicative
of completed family. size. Tables 8 and 9
respectively record the completed fertility
statistics for Colonsay and Jura, Each
island has similar proportions of couples
with completed family size (Colonsay, 26
of 32 couples, 81.2 per cent; Jura, 51 of 62
couples, 82.3 per cent) and similar numbers of endogamous and exogamous couples with completed family size (Colonsay, 25 endogamous and exogamous
couples; Jura, 27 endogamous and exoga
mous couples). On Colonsay, 20 of the 26
completed families (76.9 per cent) have
the husband older than the wife while this
proportion is 36 of the 51 completed families (70.6 per cent) on Jura.

No endogamous couple on either island
is sterile and, in fact, they have the highest
mean number of offspring per spatial marriage type. But Jura’s overall mean number of offspring (1.9+1.6 offspring per
completed family) is significantly lower
(p =0.05) than Colonsay’s overall average
(2.9+1.6 offspring per completed family).
A shorter reproductive span (Jura,
3.7+4.4 years; Colonsay, 6.043.5 years)
and a longer length of generation as
measured by the wife’s age at first child
(Jura, 29.4+6.3 years; Colonsay, 25.8 +
4.9 years) accompany Jura’s reduced fertility.

The lower fertility on Jura first derives
from an appreciable number of infertile
exogamous (5) and migrant (6) couples;
Jura’s childless rate (11 of the 51 completed families, 21.6 per cent) is nearly
twice that of Colonsay (3 of the 26 completed families, 11.5 per cent). Additionally, Jura has a higher proportion of
completed families with only one child (11
couples, 21.6 per cent) than does Colon

say (1 couple, 3.8 per cent). Late exogamous marriages on Jura play a role. Four
of the five exogamous completed families
with one child involved marriage past the
spouses’ ages of thirty and a subsequent
wife’s age at first birth past the age of 35. A
delayed age at marriage carries the biological significance of delayed age at initial

childbearing with its concomitant shorter
reproductive span (Bumpass and
Mburugu, 1977).

NATIVE GENEALOGY AND INBREEDING

The collection of genealogical data
from Colonsay and Jura natives (previously defined as inhabitants with at least

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 27, No. 2

one parent born on that island) depended
entirely upon their memories and oral tradition. They recalled remote male ancestors more frequently than remote female
ancestors. Some natives naturally remembered, or wished to reveal, more than
others. This methodology introduces a
bias in excluding possible migrant inbreeding from the calculation of a
population’s total coefficient. However,
the native pedigrees are comparable in
depth and efficiency: (1) Each pedigree includes five generations (infrequently to six
generations), and the oldest ancestors recalled are grandparents of the postreproductive natives; and (2) the native pedigree of Colonsay contains 65 of its 81
natives (80.2 per cent) while the native
pedigree of Jura contains 65 of its 74 natives (87.8 per cent).

By individual native pedigree ascertainment converted to the arithmetic

mean of the individual inbreeding coeffi- _

cients (i.e., f, the Malécot coefficient of inbreeding summarized by Reid, 1973, pp.
91-97), the inbreeding coefficient of Colonsay natives is 0.0023, or an average genealogical relationship near a third cousin
once removed. On Jura the native inbreeding coefficient is 0.0044, or an
average genealogical relationship near a
third cousin. Regarding the aforementioned methodological bias of immigrant
exclusion in pedigree linkage, the much
larger migrant group to Jura could contain
more inbred individuals but no migrant
family to either island acknowledged any
consanguinity.

Though exceeding the inbreeding
coefficient of a British sample from the
Orkney islands (f = 0.001834, Roberts et
al., 1979, p. 392), both population inbreeding coefficients are low to moderate
levels of human inbreeding (cf. Reid,
1973, pp. 98-99) and must be considered
minimum estimates restricted by their 5-6
generation depth of genealogical data;

considerable remote consanguinity was
further implied by surname concordance
in individual pedigrees. Even the highest
human population inbreeding coefficients
measured by pedigree analysis barely surpass 0 (e.g., f = 0.0403 for the 1961 islanders of Tristan da Cunha, Roberts, 1967,
p. 154). The pedigree method of allelic
identity-by-descent designates most individuals in a population of limited genealogical data with separate inbreeding
coefficients of 0. Therefore, the Malécot
coefficient as a population mean usually ©
has a modal value of 0 with low variance.
As an example from Colonsay and Jura,
each island native coefficient derived from
the high (e.g., parents as first cousins) inbreeding coefficients of a few individuals
(5 of 81 Colonsay natives, 6.2 per cent; 7
of 74 Jura natives, 9.5 per cent). Native inbreeding on Colonsay and Jura may recall
a more isolated historical past.

The native pedigree of Colonsay revealed that 45 (55.5 per cent) of the 81 natives have either MacNeill or MacPhee ancestry, the earliest surnames in island clan
history; moreover, 28 natives (34.6 per
cent) trace their ancestry to five ‘“‘founders” of the immediately past generations. On Jura, 62 (83.8 per cent) of the 74
natives have either Buie or Shaw ancestry,
recalling the earliest clan and family surnames there; 39 natives (52.7 per cent)
trace their ancestry to just four “founders” of two couples.

Such common ancestry among an appreciable number of individuals in a population constitutes the founder effect. The
founder effect is usually reported and perceived as a post hoc phenomenon of reproductive success. But Roberts (1968, 1973,
1979) has meticulously measured the
genetic effects of two census declines on
the island population of Tristan da Cunha
and discovered that considerable microevolution can occur at a nadir in numbers, or “‘bottleneck.’’ Each decline al

tered the ancestral contributions of the
original founders. The emigration of families from the island, termed the ‘‘booster
effect” (Roberts 1968, p. 1088), played a
particularly effective role in concentrating
the gametic contributions of a few ancestors at any one time. As native families
similarly emigrated from Colonsay and
Jura in steady booster effects due to
economic pressures over the last 150
years, founders have been momentarily
established for the residual native gene
pools at various points in the past. Founders, as those ancestors with the greatest
contributions to then native descendants,
were surely different in 1967, or 1957,
than ones identified in 1977. As a hypothesis for serological research, kin-structured
emigration has likely caused allelic microdifferentiation between the respective native gene pools of Colonsay and Jura (cf.
Fix, 1978; Leslie et al., 1980, 1981). Constant emigration may explain the
significant heterogeneity at the ABO and
Rh loci for Lewis island of the Outer Hebrides (Clegg, 1979, p. 468).

DISCUSSION

The combination of mutation, migration, selection, random drift, nonrandom
mating, and census history produces microevolution in a human breeding population. Although the definition of a breeding
population remains rather arbitrary, endogamous mating determines the breeding population over space while the joint
mixture and survival of ancestral genes
give it a continuity of descent through time
(Thompson et al., 1978; Sorg, 1980). An
80 per cent rate of endogamy can empirically define the genetic deme (Fix, 1979,
pp. 211-212).

Qualified as the comparative, synchronous data of semi-isolated populations
caught in a moment of time, the 1977
genetic demographies of Colonsay and

 

Social Biology

Jura islands profile the dominant and subordinate forces of microevolution there.
Demographic data do not directly investigate mutation but the family medical histories revealed no recurrent genetic
anomalies. As reported elsewhere
(Sheets, 1979), the opportunities for selection through differential fertility and
mortality on Colonsay and Jura when
measured by Crow’s Index are very low
compared to other human populations.
The low levels of native inbreeding would
not greatly affect the heterozygosity of the
gene pools. Therefore, mutation, selection, and inbreeding likely play minor
roles in the current human microevolution
on Colonsay and Jura.

Random genetic drift seems one major
force of microevolution presently at work
on Colonsay and Jura. The classic calculation for drift with its sampling deviation,s,
and

s = [q(1—q)/2N]”

measures maximum allelic change when
the gene frequency g equals 0.5 and N is
the effective population size (cf. Lasker,
1952). If the effective population sizes of
Colonsay (63.7, 50.6 per cent of the population) and Jura (74.1, 35.1 per cent of the
population) are placed in the equation,
their respective maximum sampling errors
due to random drift are +0.063 for Colonsay and 0.059 for Jura per generation.

However, Colonsay and Jura share remarkably similar census histories and migration patterns. Human movement must
rank as the dominant force during their
most recent microevolutionary episodes.
Recall from Figure 2 and Table 1:

1. Each island population peaked in
1841 and has since experienced an uninterrupted decline to a dangerously low ‘‘bottleneck” in absolute size for 1977.

2. Colonsay’s 1977 size of 127 is 13.0 per
cent of its peak population of 979 while
Jura’s 1977 size of 211 is 16.0 per cent of its
peak population of 1,320.

Vol. 27, No. 2

Today Colonsay and Jura are not rigorous
breeding populations. Given 70-75 per
cent native endogamy during 1841-1891
(Sheets, ms.), they are former geographical isolates in dissolution through an increasing marital admixture with immigrants most often from the Glasgow area.
With each generation they attain closer
genetic affinities to the mainland population of west Scotland. Jura’s faster dissolution comes from its greater economic attractiveness to outsiders. Other isolate
populations of Europe in Ireland (Crawford and Gmelch, 1974; Fox, 1978), Switzerland (Friedl and Ellis, 1974), and
Poland (Berdychowski and Henneberg,
1978) exhibit similar trends toward dissolution as they economically integrate
themselves with urban centers. Both Colonsay and Jura follow the modern tendency in Great Britain for increased interregional gene flow (Coleman 1977, 1979).

Fix (1978, pp. 329-330) reviews “‘the almost embarrassing variety of mechanisms
which may produce local genetic differentiation.”” But the relevance and the challenge of human genetic demography lie in
explanation of biological and demographic data by cultural phenomena. For
example, Clegg (1980) suggests the biological deprivations from parental unemployment may have maintained a high age
of menarche for Outer Hebridean women
born between 1920 to 1935. Human migration dictated in large part by Hebridean economics dominates the other
forces of microevolution inferred by the

respective demographic structures of Colonsay and Jura islands. Subsequent reports on the historical demography and
expanded native genealogies of Colonsay
and Jura will document the breakdown of
each local genetic isolation and hence
demonstrate how the conditions of 1977
reflect changes in population structures of
the past.
