a ABSTRACT: This paper presents a technique for scaling contraceptive use motivation for the
8 sample population of the Family Planning Health Services Project in Matlab. The project,
E which began in 1977, is conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease
S 9 Research, Bangladesh. The hypothesis of the research is that through the use of a scaling
O S algorithm the power of demographic characteristics, attitudes, and intentions for predicting
00 oc contraceptive use can be enhanced. The analysis shows that two factors explain use motivation.

< Scale 1 is weighted for demographic variables and desire for additional children, while Scale 2 is
+ >, comprised of education and intentions of contraceptive use. Both scales have a pronounced
“independent predictive power. We conclude that scaling has improved upon the predictive

3 power of indicators of reproductive motivations.

S Considerable attention in the demographic literature has been addressed to
‘Sthe question of whether stated repro‘5 ductive intentions are meaningful indi&cators of subsequent reproductive be“havior. Prospective studies have
‘demonstrated the inconsistency be~ tween stated intentions and behavior
®@(Kar, 1978; Freedman, 1975; and Her3 malin, 1979). Much of the methodologi‘g cal work on intentions and behavior at‘etempts to bring into account the
5 multidimensionality of preference. For
© example, Coombset. al. (1973) have developed a method from scaling theory
which incorporates multiple responses
about alternative family composition
into the construction of a single preference scale.

This paper utilizes three years of data
from Matlab to test a procedure for
measuring underlying motivation to
practice family planning. The underlying logic derives from the observation
that many characteristics of women cor
relate in some way to contraceptive use,
and each variable thus reflects “motivation” to some degree. Consequently, a
simple measure of intentions as a predictor of contraceptive use can be improved upon by considering other influential variables. In this analysis we
examine a set of variables which we
posit as correlates of contraceptive use.
Hypothesized predisposing characteristics of users function as independent
variables, and use of contraceptives is
the dependent variable. In order to prepare a multidimensional scale of the independent variables, factor analysis is
applied to the data set.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In December 1977, two months after
initiation of the Family Planning Health
Services Project (FPHSP) in Matlab, a
survey was conducted to serve as a baseline for measuring subsequent changes
in knowledge of use of and intention to

use contraception. Among the respondents of the original sample, 20 per cent
were reinterviewed in December 1978
and December 1979. The design of the
field aspects of the FPHSP and the services provided have been documented by
Bhatia (1980) and the system of record
keeping and service statistics were documented by Rahman (1981). Research
has shown that the FPHSP has had a
significant impact on fertility (Phillips,
1982) and child mortality (Chowdhury,
1986). In the baseline survey in 1977, all
the eligible women of FPHSP were interviewed with a questionnaire, known
as Record Keeping System-1. Items of
information in the questionnaire include: sociodemographic characteristics
of the respondents, their knowledge and
use of contraception, desire for additional children, and intention to use contraception in the future.

Social Biology

In the original sample, there were approximately 13,000 eligible women interviewed, and from among these 20 per
cent were selected using proportional allocation according to the size of villages.
There were 2,299 eligible women after
an exclusion of 11.5 per cent of women
who lost their eligibility because of divorce, widowhood, sterilization, migration out, and husband absent from
household. These women were subsequently reinterviewed in.1978 and again
in 1979, In all, 2,217 and 2,120 women
were found to be present in the first and
the second rounds of the survey, respectively. Among the respondents of the
three different surveys, 2,111 were
found to be present in al! the surveys.
These respondents constitute the sample for the analysis in this paper. Thus,
the nonresponse rate is 8.2 per cent in
this study.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The conceptual framework for this
analysis appears in Figure 1. Motivation
to use contraception (M) is viewed as a
proximate determinant of use (UV), Path
(1).

Motivation, in turn, is affected by reproductive norms, attitudes, and beliefs
(A), Path (2). This, in turn, has two
causal components. Demographic characteristics, such as number of living children, directly affect motivation, Path
(3), and also directly affect attitudes,
Path (4), through the impact of sex preference on the desire for additional children. Background characteristics (B)
such as educational attainment and economic status also directly affect motivation, Path (5), and attitudes, Path (6).

RESULTS

SCALING CONTRACEPTIVE USE
MOTIVATION

It is useful to note that scaling theory
posits that some unmeasured construct
has measured indicators, each with an
unknown weight representing the specific contribution of an indicator to the
scale. Factor analysis is one among
many techniques that can be used to
identify commonality of a set of indicators, to quantify their relationship to the
unmeasured scale, and to thereby permit scoring of each individual on the
scale by simply summing the weights associated with the particular attributes of
each case (Goruch, 1974).

A representation of a common factor
model for individual i is a linear model
of the form:

where

Xj is a predicted response of individual ito

F; 1s score of individual i for the first factor.

W,,is loading of variable v for Factor f.

Fis the factor of individual i common factor f.

W, is the weight given to variable.

Uj, is unique factor score of individual i for
variable v.

The Uv are factors derived from the
generalization of individual variation to
the sample population—‘‘the within individual” component to variation.

Table 1 shows that two factors explain “‘use motivation” and the logit regression results at the bottom of the table show that these scales predict use
with about the same degree of goodness
of fit as the raw data (Likelihood Ratio
Statistics = 373.3 versus 394.8) which
was found on predicting power of contraceptive use by a logit regression
model by Chowdhury (1983). The loadings show that Scale 1 is weighted for demographic variables and desire for additional children, while Scale 2 is
comprised of education, intentions, and
current use. As the logit results show,
both the scales have a pronounced independent predictive power that greatly
exceeds the effect of any single indicator.

Table 1 also shows that varimax matrix rotation improves the precision of
loadings in that the loadings for the two
scales are more distinct, but the magnitude and signs of the rotated loadings
are not appreciably changed.

The logit regression results attest to
the utility of scaling. For example, if a
respondent was one standard deviation
above the mean on the “demographic
pressure” and “reproductive intention”
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

scales in 1977, her predicted probability
of use two years later is given by:

P = [1 + Exp{—(— 0.801 + 0.837
x 1.712 + 0.457 x 0.684)}] = 0.720

Similarly, an exceptionally motivated
respondent who is two standard deviations above the mean with respect to
both scales has a predicted use probability of

P= [1 + Exp{—(— 0.801 + 0.837
X 1.712 x 2 + 0.457 x 0.684
x 2)}] = 0.936

Clearly, scaling has improved upon
the predictive power of indicators of reproductive motivation.

DISCUSSION

On the basis of the above analysis it
was found that motivation to use contraceptives is multidimensional in nature
and should not be measured by intentions alone. The predominant influence
was exercised by the demographic factors of age, living children, and living
sons, and the attitudinal factors of desire
for additional children and intentions.

Fic. 1.—Conceptual framework.

Social Biology

Attitude, in Figure 1, is multidimensional with family size desires and demographics reflecting a ‘“‘demographic
pressure dimension,” and with intention
and husband’s education reflecting a
separate factor which represents a “reproductive planning” dimension. Husband’s education has an effect that is
largely distinct from desire for additional children but is associated with intention and use. Intention, current use,
and education load well into a common
factor. The effect of demographic factors on contraceptive use is mediated by
family size desires. Most importantly,
the paper has shown that a set of indicators, taken together, are highly predictive of contraceptive use.
