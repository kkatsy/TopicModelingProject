Mean Age and Life Expectancy at Birth
in Stationary Populations: Comment

Morales (1989) calls attention to an
inequality that was developed in the economics literature in 1977 relating the
mean age of a stationary population, life
expectancy, and the variance in ages at
“death.” He is correct that it is an important relation and that it is largely unknown in American demography. However, a full version of the relation is
derived in Pressat (1972, p. 480):

_l1(e+ co
Ap 54

where
Ap = the mean age of the
stationary population,
€o = life expectancy at birth,
o? = variance in ages at death.

One interesting application of the
equation occurs for processes in which

 

the risk of an event is constant over age
or duration. In this case, o? = e2 and
Ap = €o. For example, if fecundability
(the monthly probability of conception
for a noncontracepting woman exposed
to intercourse) is constant over time and
across women, then the mean number
of months required for a woman to become pregnant will equal the mean
length of time that a group of women in
the cross-section have been exposed to
the risk of pregnancy.
