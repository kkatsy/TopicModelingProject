\O ABSTRACT: Much lower levels of fertility in urban than rural areas throughout sub-Saharan
© Africa imply that fertility decline in the region may be facilitated by rapid urbanization and
_rural-to-urban migration. The present study uses data from Demographic and Health Surveys
Cin six countries—Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Togo and Uganda—to assess the impact of
olong-term rural-urban female migration on fertility. Results of logit analyses indicate that in most
countries women who leave the countryside represent the higher fertility segment of the rural
© population i in the years before migration. Migrants’ risk of conception declines dramatically in
all countries around the time of migration and remains lower in the long run among most migrant
‘2 groups than among rural and urban nonmigrants. Descriptive analyses suggest that the decline

spousal separation.

in retrospective birth histories, and
thereby allow for the first time the
cross-national study of migration-fertility interrelationships.

Our limited knowledge of the demographic consequences of migration to
African cities is also a result of historical patterns of migration in the region.
Most migrant women have been seasonal circulators who migrate between
rural areas. Large-scale migration of
women to cities is a recent phenomenon in most countries. Migrationfertility linkages have become more
important for African demographic research, however, in light of the increasing volume and permanence of female
rural-to-urban migration in the region
in recent years (Peil, 1985). These linkages also have critical implications for
government policies and programs relating to migration and family planning. Identification of a prolonged
decline in migrant fertility following
migration, for example, would suggest
that many migrants may have moved to
the city in part to realize their familybuilding preferences, and may serve
as “innovators” who can impart ideas
concerning lower family size to other
urban subgroups, as well as to the rural
population upon visiting or resettling
in the town or village. For governments seeking to lower national population growth, such a finding would
support the removal of policy barriers
to cityward migration. On the other
hand, evidence of continued high or increased fertility after several years of
urban residence would identify migrants as an appropriate target group
for urban family planning programs,
and would provide justification for
some of the anti-accomodationist measures of municipal and national author

ities throughout the region who aim to
reduce current high rates of urban
growth.

The present study uses DHS data
from six countries—Ghana, Kenya,
Mali, Senegal, Togo, and Uganda—to
assess the impact of long-term rural
to urban migration on fertility. The
central research question is whether individual women modify their reproductive behavior as a result of moving
from high to lower fertility settings,
and if so, at what stage and through
what mechanisms this occurs. A crossnational focus is chosen to address this
issue, to examine whether observed
migration-fertility relationships are
generalizable to the West and East Africa regions as a whole.

CONCEPTS AND HYPOTHESES

To date, studies of the interrelationships between migration and fertility
have been mainly guided by four theoretical perspectives: selectivity, disruption, adaptation and socialization.
These differ from each other in (1) relating migrant-nonmigrant fertility differentials to the timing of migration
and (2) their emphasis on the impact of
type of residence and the act of migration itself on fertility.

The selectivity hypothesis argues
that migrant-nonmigrant fertility differentials exist before migration. It is
well established that migrants are selected at origin in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, many of which
are believed to affect fertility directly or indirectly. Rural-urban migrant
women in Africa in the 1980’s, for example, were more likely to be unmarried, educated, and to have experienced low child mortality than women
who remained in rural areas (Brocker
 
 

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

hoff and Eu, 1993), all of which would
be expected to result in lower fertility
for migrant women before the move,
and fertility patterns which resemble
those of the native urban population
after migration. In addition, migrants
may be selected in terms of some unobserved orientation toward change
(Sabagh and Yim, 1980) or fertility
preferences, which determine one’s
= — residence choices (Ribe and Schultz,
aI 1980). It is plausible, for instance, that
9 for some women, migration to urban
€ areas may be motivated by a desire to

S (Goldstein, 1983; Hendershot, 1971).
‘5s Migration and reproductive behavior
&may both reflect migrants’ desire for
“upward social mobility. In African
-& settings, this desire may lead to fer~ tility control, e.g., to pursue incomeearning opportunities, or high fertility,
'g to enhance the social status of the mi'S grant. Whatever the personal charac= teristics that distinguish migrants from
= nonmigrants, the selectivity hypothesis
A posits that it is these differentials,
rather than the migration process or
residential setting, that explain fertility
differentials (Bacal, 1988).

The disruption hypothesis maintains
that temporary changes associated
with the process of migration itself interfere with fertility just before migration, during the move, and in the
months immediately following resettlement in the new location (Goldstein
and Goldstein, 1982), primarily by re

ducing the frequency of sexual intercourse. Migration may involve, for example, temporary spousal separation
(Millman and Potter, 1984) or an interruption of mate selection (Hendershot, 1976). In high fertility populations, separations of two or more years
duration can be expected to have a
marked effect on fertility, particularly
among younger couples (Potter and
Kobrin, 1982). In the case of family migration, increasingly common in parts
of Africa (Peil, 1985), the risk of conception or birth may be reduced by loss
of libido or the stress associated with
moving (Hervitz, 1985). On the other
hand, migration may result in termination of lactational amenorrhea, e.g., if
the breastfeeding child is fostered out
by the migrant mother, or in unavailability of contraception while the
woman is migrating or before she has
located a source of supply in the new
location, both of which could increase
the migrant woman’s probability of
conceiving. The disruptive effect of
migration may also be age-related
(Stephen and Bean, 1992) and vary according to the economic status of the
couple (Yadava and Yadava, 1990).
A third perspective, the adaptation
hypothesis (Goldstein and Goldstein,
1983), places emphasis on the effect of
destination setting on migrants’ fertility. It assumes that migrants will undergo changes in fertility attitudes and
behavior after migration as they gradually adapt to the new socioeconomic,
cultural, and physical environment at
destination (Hervitz, 1985). Such
changes in behavior will be fast enough
that migrants’ fertility soon comes to
resemble that of natives in the destination area (Stephen and Bean, 1992).
With respect to rural-urban migrants,

their lower fertility than rural nonmigrants results mainly from migrants’
adjustment to urban constraints (e.g.,
higher costs of living and childraising,
more crowded housing) and _ their
adoption of urban (lower) fertility
norms through exposure to modern
media (Farber and Lee, 1984; Goldstein, 1978; Lee and Farber, 1984) or
as a function of changing tastes (Campbell, 1989; Findley, 1982). In the African context, increased contraceptive
use and induced abortion may both
contribute to reduce the fertility of
rural-urban migrants, given the greater
availability of family planning services
and possibly fewer constraints to illegal
abortion in urban than rural areas (Coeytaux, 1988). Insofar as urban areas
are characterized by much lower fertility than rural areas in most developing
countries, including throughout Africa, the adaptation hypothesis takes
on the policy implication that ruralurban migration may be an important
mechanism to reduce national fertility
and population growth.

Finally, the socialization hypothesis
argues that changes in fertility norms
and behavior take place over a long
time period, often from generation to
generation. While also recognizing the
importance of setting, it posits that migrants’ fertility preferences are determined by their childhood environment
(Hervitz, 1985). Hence, rural-urban
migrants are expected to have similar
fertility levels after migration as nonmigrants at the rural origin despite the
presence of sufficient motivating factors to lower fertility in the urban area,
because of the inherited barriers of
childhood socialization (Perez, 1991).
Convergence of migrants’ fertility to

wards that of urban natives is expected
to occur only after a generation (Campbell, 1989; Lee et al., 1983). Due to
data limitations, most studies, including ours, are unable to directly test the
socialization hypothesis and can only
infer it from the absence of an adaptation effect.

The four hypotheses, if supported
by empirical evidence, can lead to different conclusions concerning (1) the
fertility impact of migration and (2) the
timing of such impact (immediate or
long-term). Results of numerous research efforts to date vary considerably
from study to study (Perez, 1991). Inconsistent findings may suggest that the
interrelations between migration and
fertility differ depending on the cultural and socioeconomic contexts under investigation. We argue, however,
that a more problematic issue relates to
measurement and research design.

While some studies have used longitudinal data to assess the childbearing risks of individual women in relation to the timing of migration
(Goldstein and Goldstein, 1982; Lee.
and Farber, 1984), most studies on
migrant fertility have used cumulative
fertility measures such as “children
ever born.” With these measures it is
difficult, if not impossible, to separate
later effects (adaptation) from earlier
ones (selectivity or disruption). For
example, lower cumulative fertility of
migrants at destination than nonmigrants at origin could be the result of
selectivity, disruption, adaptation, or a
combination of the three. The question
therefore remains as to what extent migrants’ fertility is subject to more than
one of the expected effects, and if so,
which effect is most important.
 

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

A second problem is that most research based on single-round survey
data measures interruption and adaptation effects by the observed fertility difference between two migrant
groups: recent and long-term migrants,
or actual and expectant migrants.
Lower or higher fertility of long-term
migrants than their recent counterparts
is interpreted as an adaptation or dis~Y . . °

instead of one setting, to arrive at more

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

The six DHS analyzed here, conducted between 1986 and 1990, interviewed women ages 15 to 49 regardless
of marital status. Each survey used a
nationally: representative sample except in Uganda, where nine northern
districts representing about 20 per cent
of the national population were excluded. Sample sizes range from 3,200
in Mali to 7,150 in Kenya, while the
number of women who migrated to urban areas, our focal group, ranges
from 759 in Mali to 1,197 in Kenya.
Each survey defined “urban area”’ according to the definition used in the
most recent census, with minimum
population sizes ranging from 1,000 to
10,000. Migrants are defined in the
DHS on the basis of the question
‘“‘How long have you lived in this locality?” Nonmigrants, or natives, are
those women who respond “‘Always,”’
while responses of migrants are coded
by number of complete years lived in
the current area. We have calculated
the time of migration to the current locality as the survey month minus the
number of complete years lived at
the locality, e.g., women responding
“three” settled in the urban area 36
months before the survey month. It
should be noted that the period of
residence in the current locality may
include departures of less than six
months to other localities, where some
children may have been conceived.

The quality of the migration data
may suffer most from problems of

representativeness. Migrants living in
the city at the time of the survey may
not be representative of all persons
who in-migrated over a given time period, if there has been selective onward
or return migration. One way to assess
this is through a comparison of characteristics of current urban migrants
and rural residents who have returned
from urban areas (urban-rural migrants). In the six countries studied
here, socioeconomic differences between these groups (not shown) are
sufficiently small] in size, and the number of permanent returnees to rural areas so few, as to discount the importance of selective return migration as a
threat to the following analyses.

The limitations of fertility data collected in retrospective birth histories
are well known (Hill and David, 1988)
and will not be repeated here. While
DHS data quality is thought to be inferior to WFS data collected in some
African countries, such as Senegal
(Barbieri, 1990), in general, DHS fertility and mortality data from Africa
and elsewhere compare favorably with
information gathered by the WFS (Institute for Resource Development,
1990). .

DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES

The total fertility rates of ruralurban migrant and nonmigrant groups
presented in Table 1 provide some insight into whether migrants to African
towns and cities are selected for higher
or lower fertility than rural stayers,
whether childbearing patterns are disrupted by migration, and whether migrants eventually experience the lower
fertility levels of urban natives. Rates
are calculated for three-year periods
to enhance the reliability of estimates

Social Biology

based on small numbers of women in
some age groups. A rough indicator of
migrant selectivity is the fertility rate
three to six years before the survey of
women who subsequently migrated to
urban areas in the three years preceding the survey, as compared to the rate
of rural nonmigrants during that period. The hypothesis that migration
disrupts fertility can be assessed by
comparing the rate of this most recent
migrant group during the three years
preceding the survey (during which
time they migrated) to their rate in the
earlier period. Evidence of fertility disruption would be a decrease (or increase) in migrant fertility between the
periods that differs significantly from
the change in fertility experienced by
nonmigrants. The fertility rate of
women who migrated three to six years
ago during that period may also reflect
temporary changes in childbearing patterns as a result of migration, to the extent that the rate increases in the subsequent three-year period, or differs
greatly from those of women living in
rural areas (rural natives and less-thanthree years migrants) in this earlier
period. Adaptation to lower fertility in
urban areas would be reflected most
obviously by a decrease in the fertility
rate of women who in-migrated six to
ten years ago from the earlier to later
periods, to levels that approximate
those of lifetime urban residents.
Table 1 indicates that women who
migrated from rural to urban areas in
the three years preceding the survey in
each country had lower fertility than
rural natives in the years immediately
preceding migration. These migrants’
total fertility rate in the period three to
six years before the survey ranged from
0.26 lower than rural stayers in Uganda

analyses later in this study will examine
whether this migrant selectivity for
lower fertility just before migration reflects a postponement of childbearing

until after the move, or a continuation
of lower fertility than nonmigrants
throughout the childbearing ages before migration. The rates also suggest
that migration from rural to urban

areas disrupts fertility in some African
countries, but does not always lead to
a temporary decline in fertility. In
Ghana and Mali, the most recent migrant group experienced a larger decline in fertility between the premigration and migration periods than
did nonmigrants between these threeyear periods, and women who migrated three to six years ago experienced much lower fertility during that
period than women in rural areas. On
the other hand, in Kenya and Togo, recent migrants experienced an increase
in fertility during the period in which
they migrated while the fertility of
rural and urban nonmigrants declined.
These differences between countries
might be explained by variation in
the extent to which migration involves
spousal separation or results in termination of lactational amenorrhea (e.g.,
if the breastfeeding child does not accompany the migrant mother).
Except in Uganda, where the fertility rate of long-term migrants remained at 5.9 over time, there is a clear
pattern of fertility decline among migrants after several years residence in
urban areas, which in most countries
exceeds the decline experienced by
urban natives. In Ghana, for instance,
six- to ten-year migrants experienced a
decline in fertility from 5.61 to 5.35 between the three-year periods while urban natives experienced an increase
from 5.21 to 5.34. In each country except Togo, fertility rates of long-term
migrants were closer to those of urban natives after living in the town or
city for several years than earlier, and
in Ghana and Kenya these migrants
achieved virtually identical fertility levels as urban natives. In sum, there is
evidence in support of each of the three

 

Social Biology

main hypothesized migration-fertility
relationships in most of these African
countries. It is also worth noting that
lifelong urban residents had considerably lower fertility than their rural
counterparts in the three years before
the survey in each country, suggesting
that there are indeed distinct urban
and rural fertility regimes in the region
which can be expected to impact on migrants’ fertility as they move between
areas.

While the DHS allow one to link
fertility to the timing of migration, as in
the following multivariate analysis, the
data provide more limited insight into
how migration affects proximate or
underlying determinants of fertility.
Aside from the information collected
in retrospective birth histories, most
other information collected from respondents relates to their status at the
time of the survey, rather than to the
pre-migration period or the time of
migration. The most critical limitation
of the data for this study is the lack of
direct information on spousal separation around the time of migration,
which presumably would have a dramatic impact on migrant fertility.
Nevertheless, comparisons of current
Status indicators of migrant and nonmigrant women can illuminate some
mechanisms through which ruralurban migration affects fertility, insofar as characteristics of migrants who
differ in duration of residence at the
time of the survey are suggestive of
changes experienced by all migrant
women with increased length of residence in the urban area.

Table 2 shows the per cent of married female visitors, migrants, and natives who were cohabiting with their
husband at the time of the survey, and
 

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

the per cent of these women who were
using a method of contraception.
While living in a separate household
from one’s spouse does not necessarily
imply great distance between spouses,
particularly in societies where polygamy is common, it may also reflect
separation as a result of the migration
of one spouse, as well as the necessity
of migrant couples to live temporarily
‘Cin separate dwellings (e.g., with kin)
upon entering the urban area until a
permanent residence can be estabFlished. From the table it appears, on
othe whole, that women who visit towns
sand cities for short periods, for employment or other reasons, often leave
= their husbands behind in the village,
"-whereas women who migrate to urban
areas for longer periods are more likely
Sto be joining their husbands. The sim<ilar or higher percentage of recent mi‘Sgrant (less than three years residence)
‘than urban native women living with

“that spousal separation accounts for little if any fertility decline experienced
by migrants after settling in the urban
>area. On the other hand, increased access to family planning services may
‘Zhave an immediate impact on the fer<tility of new urban residents. Among
women living with their husbands, recent migrants were more likely than rural natives to be using contraception in
each country. In Ghana, for example,
18 per cent of recent urban migrants
were using contraception, compared to
9 per cent of rural natives, while in
Uganda, about 15 per cent of recent
migrants and only 4 per cent of rural
natives used family planning. In each
country except Mali, contraceptive use
was moderately greater among longterm than recent migrants, which may

 

Migration and Fertility in Africa 27

imply gradual adaptation to urban
norms, constraints and opportunities
that favor fertility regulation, or may
simply reflect age or family-size differences between the migrant groups.
Table 3 presents socioeconomic, behavioral, and attitudinal characteristics
of migrant and nonmigrant groups that
may account for fertility differentials.
In the three francophone countries
examined, migrants are less educated
than lifelong urban residents, reflecting the unavailability of schooling
for women in much of rural Africa.
Women who migrated to cities, however, particularly those who moved
in the mid-1980’s, were considerably
more likely to have received schooling
than women who remained in rural
areas in each country, suggesting a possible inclination or receptiveness to
lower fertility once settled in the city.
Contrary to popular conceptions
(Abu-Lughod, 1961; Adepoju, 1984;
Lerner, 1967), migrants from the African countryside are not disadvantaged socioeconomically compared to
more established urban residents and
immediately achieve or surpass the
standard of living of urban natives.
While migrants are moderately disadvantaged in wealth and income in
Senegal, and slightly disadvantaged in
Mali, they quickly achieve similar economic levels as native women in Kenya
and Togo, and slightly higher levels in
Ghana and Uganda. Similarly, housing
facilities of migrants, which may be
suggestive of the social modernity of
urban neighborhoods in which migrants reside, are clearly inferior to
those of urban natives only in Senegal,
and are superior in Ghana and

region women dramatically improve
their economic status by migrating
from the countryside to towns and cities, which may allow them to support
more children, or conversely, may reduce the need to have many children as
an income-earning or economic security strategy.

 

The cross-sectional comparisons in
Table 3 also suggest that migrants from
rural areas do not necessarily gradually
adopt the shorter breastfeeding durations that are associated with urban areas and that could increase the risk of
conception following migration. In
four of the six countries, urban-born

children of recent migrants were
breastfed for shorter periods than children of long-time migrants. On the
whole, however, differences in duration of breastfeeding between urban
and rural groups remain small and are
unlikely to contribute substantially to
fertility differentials. Only in Mali and
Senegal, where they are the least welleducated, are migrant women less

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

MODEL AND VARIABLES

Downloaded by [Un

Logistic regression is used to analyze the risk of conceiving in the ten
years preceding the survey in each
country. Our model estimates migrants’ risk of conception at various
time periods before and after migration in relation to the risk of urban and
rural nonmigrants. The model includes
a set of demographic and socioeconomic variables commonly associated
with fertility to assess whether migrantnonmigrant differences observed in

Migration and Fertility in Africa 29

Table 1 are the result of differences
in these other factors. The multivariate model thus provides more precise
and comprehensive information on
migration-fertility interrelations than
the total fertility rates presented in Table 1, inasmuch as there is greater temporal coherence between migration
and conception, a broader time frame
is examined, the same migrant women
are observed before and after migration, and possible explanations for
migrant-native fertility differentials are
considered.

Since the DHS do not provide information on date of divorce or separation, our sample is restricted to birth
intervals of women whose first marriage was intact throughout the tenyear interval. Rural-to-rural migrants,
who are of less interest to our study,
and urban-to-rural migrants, who are
too few to analyze, are excluded from
the sample.

The model takes the following form:

In(P/1—P) =pPiZ ofr q,U + r,M1 +
ry>M2 + r3M3 + r,M4 + s,N1 ss
s,N2 + 53N3,

where,

 (P/1-P) = the odds of conceiving
(date of birth — 9 months) since a live
birth or (for first birth intervals) since
the month of marriage;

Z = aset of demographic and socioeconomic predictors of fertility (woman’s age and parity at the beginning of
the birth interval, survival status of the
child born at the beginning of the interval, and woman’s level of education);

U = a dummy variable for non-migrants (1 = urban residence, 0 = rural
residence);

parameters to be estimated.

N2 encompasses both the year before and the two years after migration
due to the small number of women in
our sample who moved between urban
areas in each of these two periods.

The calendar period for exposure to
the risk of conception is roughly similar
for migrants and nonmigrants. For
nonmigrants it is the entire ten-year
period before the survey. For most migrants, the time periods before and after migration used in the analysis may
have occurred at any time during the
ten years, since migrants may have
moved at any time in the ten years.
However, women who migrated in the
two years preceding the survey are excluded from the M4 and N3 categories,
and most of these women did not experience the full 23 months after migration represented by M3 and N2.
Similarly, those women who migrated

 

 

Social Biology

nine to ten years before the survey
were not exposed in the period 12 or
more months before migration. We do
not believe that this censoring has a
substantial effect on our results.

The other independent variables included in the model are chosen on the
basis of previous research that demonstrates their strong relationship with
length of succeeding birth interval. The
coding of these variables is presented
in Table 4. We employ only one socioeconomic variable, level of female education, because other common socioeconomic determinants of fertility
available in the DHS, such as proxies
for household income (e.g., husband’s
occupation, ownership of consumer
durables), are likely to have changed at
some unidentifiable time between the
pre-migration period and the time of
the survey. Female schooling in subSaharan Africa, on the other hand, is
typically completed before age 15,
whereas mean age at migration to urban areas is no earlier than 24 in these
surveys.

The negative effect of female education on fertility has been shown and
explained in countless analyses of WFS
data (United Nations, 1987; Cochrane
and Farid, 1989; Ashurst et al., 1984)
and will not be elaborated on here. In
our analysis, the education variable is
particularly critical to assess whether
higher (or lower) migrant than nonmigrant fertility in the pre-migration period is a result of the pronounced differences in level of education between
the groups observed in Table 3, and
whether adaptation to lower fertility in
the city is facilitated by or contingent
on the woman having received schooling, as suggested elsewhere (Findley,
1982).

> The three demographic variables ineluded: in the model—woman’s age and
‘parity at the beginning of the interval
and the survival status of the child born
Bat the beginning of the interval—have
been used in virtually all recent studies
of determinants of birth interval
length. Each of these factors may have
a greater effect on proximate determinants of fertility than factors associated
with the migration process. Older
women are less fecund and, along with
high parity women, less likely to want

additional children than women at an >

earlier stage of the reproductive life
cycle, both of which conditions should
result in longer or open-ended follow
ing birth intervals. In some African
settings, older women may also respect traditional abstinence rules more
often and practice longer breastfeeding
(Trussell et al., 1989). Analyses of survey data from a wide range of areas,
including the Philippines (Akin et al.,
1988), Peninsular Malaysia (DaVanzo
and Starbird, 1991), Indonesia (Trussell et al., 1985), Kenya (Starbird et
al., 1990) and nine countries surveyed
by the WFS (Rodriguez et al., 1984) all
show either a strong inverse relationship between age of mother at the start
of the interval and her risk of conceiving or giving birth within the interval,
or a positive relationship between age
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

34 Brockerhoff and Yang

and length of interval. The declining
probability of conception with increasing birth order, on the other hand, is
a sensible hypothesis that has been
more often disproven than confirmed
in multivariate analyses that account
for other demographic influences on
fertility (Rodriguez et al., 1984).

In settings where women exercise
limited control over reproduction,
such as those studied here, the death of
the child born at the start of the interval can be expected to hasten a following conception primarily through the
termination of breastfeeding in cases
where the child died at a young age,
and to a lesser extent through nonuse
of contraception in order to replace the
child (Mensch, 1985). In our analysis,
we estimate the risk of conception associated with a child death at any age
of child but before the mother has conceived the subsequent child.

RESULTS

Table 5 presents exponentiated parameter estimates of the risk of conception for migrants at different stages
of the migration process and other results of the multivariate model. The estimates for migrants are also illustrated
in Figures 1 and 2. Rural natives are
used as the reference category in the
analysis in order to emphasize distinctions in rural areas in the pre-migration
period, e.g., the degree to which migrants are selected for higher or lower
fertility. The brackets next to the estimates for migrants indicate whether
these estimates are also significantly
different from those of urban natives.

In the period more than one year
before migration, migrant women
had much higher fertility than women

 

Social Biology

who remained in the countryside in
most countries. The risk of conception
among rural-urban migrants was
roughly twice that of rural stayers in
Ghana, Mali, and Senegal, and almost
three times as high in Uganda. Married
women who migrated between urban
areas also had significantly higher fertility than urban natives in Ghana
and Senegal in this period. This high
fertility of migrants a few years before
migration may reflect, among some
women, a deliberate attempt to have
children after the decision to migrate
has been made but before the women
(or their husbands) leave the village.
This might occur, for instance, if husbands migrate in advance of their wives
to secure an income or establish residence in the city, if women have to satisfy the fertility expectations of husbands and kin prior to moving, or if
there is an intention to complete
breastfeeding before moving. Viewed
differently, these estimates suggest
that childbearing may instigate migration to urban areas among some
women in these countries, if for example, the mother seeks the superior
amenities (e.g., modern health care,
schools) available for her young children in the town or city. In any case,
the estimates strongly suggest that insofar as migrants experience lower fertility than nonmigrants after migration,
this is not a result of migrants having
been the low fertility segment of the
population at origin.

Throughout Africa, migrant fertility
declines dramatically around the time
of migration. In each country except
Togo, rural-urban migrants experience
a substantial decrease in their risk of
conception between the distant and immediate pre-migration periods. The

decline is most striking for migrants in
Ghana and Kenya, falling to about
one-third the level of rural stayers.
One interpretation of this pattern is
that women in many African societies
do not migrate for long periods when
they have infants, but only after their
children are perceived as old enough to
accompany them or be fostered-out by
the migrant mother. In Togo, the decline in fertility occurs during the first
two years in the urban area, when risks
of migrants from rural areas are about
30 per cent lower than those of the native urban population (as in Uganda).
Similarly, migrants between urban areas appear to experience a drop in their
risk of conception around the time of
migration in each country except Togo,
although we can say this with confidence for only three countries (Ghana,
Kenya, and Senegal). The implication
is that migration to African towns and
cities involves personal or situational
changes that dramatically reduce fertility irrespective of national setting or
migrant background.

These reproductive patterns in the
time surrounding migration are no
doubt due in part to the temporary
spousal separation that often accompanies migration throughout sub-Saharan
Africa, particularly migration to towns
and cities (Adepoju, 1984). The extremely low risk of conception among
migrants in Ghana and Kenya just
prior to migration suggests that husbands of migrants may have already
departed for the urban area, as has
been the historical pattern of family
migration in these countries (Caldwell,
1969; Ominde, 1968) as well as elsewhere in the region (O’Connor, 1983).
In cases where the couple migrates together, it is plausible that they choose

not to conceive after they have decided
to move, in order to facilitate the move
and not give birth in unfamiliar surroundings. An alternative explanation
for the low risk in Ghana and Kenya is
that pregnant women do not migrate,
in order to preserve their own and their
child’s health and to receive support
from family and kin during delivery
and immediately following childbirth.
The lower risk of conception of migrants than rural natives around the
time of migration in the non-Sahelian
countries is also consistent with the
greater use of contraception among migrants than rural women as observed in
Table 2.

After having lived in the new urban
locality for two or more years, the fertility of migrants from both rural and
urban areas closely approximates the
fertility of native urban women in four
of the countries—Ghana, Kenya,
Mali, and Senegal. In the other two
countries, Togo and Uganda, ruralurban migrants have a significantly
lower risk of conception after living
two years in urban areas than urban natives. A significant increase, or “‘catching up,” in fertility following the dramatic decrease around the time of
migration is observed only among
urban-urban migrants in Ghana,
Kenya, and Togo, and these increases
are modest. The continued low fertility
of urban migrants over time suggests
that, in addition to postponement of
childbearing due to spousal separation
or other factors, a desire to have fewer
children or even terminate childbearing may account for much of the
decrease in conception we observe
around the time of migration as well as
in subsequent years. To the extent that
such reproductive control is exercised
Vol. 41, No. 1-2

by migrant women, it does not appear
attributable to advanced age or high
completed fertility.

In contrast to the early premigration period, when rural-urban
migrants in most countries experienced
much higher fertility than rural nonmigrants, after living in the city for several years women who left the countryside experienced a 24 to 49 per cent
lower risk of conception than rural natives in the four non-Sahelian countries. In all six countries, the risk
among migrants was also significantly
lower after two years of urban residence than in the initial pre-migration
period (test not shown), often by large
amounts. Although one can only speculate what migrants’ fertility would
have been had they remained in rural
areas, these results do suggest that fac
tors associated with the process of miS gration to African towns and cities re‘5 duce migrant fertility, and probably
contribute to the much lower urban
than rural fertility observed in African
-= countries.

In the absence of information on migrants’ reproductive attitudes or intentions over time, one cannot accurately
assess the relative importance of mirant selectivity in rural areas and mirants’ adjustment to the urban environment in determining their lower
fertility in African towns and cities. To
the extent that women move to urban
areas to pursue smaller family size,
these intentions are probably most
prevalent among rural women who
have received some schooling. An interaction term not included in our final
mode], however, revealed that migrants’ risk of conception after living in
the urban area for two years does not
significantly differ according to their

level of education in any of the countries analyzed. It seems more plausible
that many migrant women intend to
pursue large families or have additional children soon after settling in
the urban area, but are either circumscribed by structural forces common to
urban settings—limited housing space
and land, high costs of raising children,
greater income-earning opportunities
for women—that limit the number of
children an urban couple can support,
or gradually modify their reproductive
preferences as a result of exposure to
groups or institutions that favor lower
fertility.

Whereas Table 1 showed that urban
and rural nonmigrants experienced
very different levels of fertility in
the 1980’s, the multivariate analysis reveals significantly lower fertility for urban natives only in Kenya. This finding
is not surprising, insofar as the female
populations in rural and urban areas of
Africa are known to differ considerably in terms of factors included in this
model that impact on the timing or
level of fertility; on average, rural
women are younger, commence childbearing earlier, experience higher
child mortality, and are less educated
than urban women. As expected, older
age, high parity, survival of the child
born at the beginning of the interval,
and schooling each reduce a woman’s
risk of conceiving in most countries,
confirming previous findings from the
region (Starbird et al., 1990). Notably,
women have a considerably higher risk
of conceiving at parity one than at parity two to four when one considers also
whether they are age thirty or older,
reflecting that many women in the region do limit their family size. It is also
worth noting that in each country

where female education lowers the risk
of fertility, this reduction occurs from
primary schooling, but further substantial reductions result from secondary
school education. In sum, however, we
conclude that factors associated with
migrants, rural or urban areas of Africa, or the process of migration that
are not included in our model result in
distinct patterns of fertility among migrants over the course of the migration
process.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Of the hypotheses tested in this
study, the one most strongly confirmed
is that factors associated with migration to African towns and cities lead to
a decline in fertility around the time of
migration, i.e., the “disruption” perspective. This decline is apparent in all
of the states examined, is pronounced,
and is experienced by both urban- and
rural-origin migrants. Unfortunately,
the DHS provide limited information
on the mechanisms involved in this decline, although it is probable that temporary spousal separation is a predominant cause.

Several notable characteristics of
migrant fertility observed in Asian and
Latin American settings are not found
in these sub-Saharan African countries. Low migrant fertility following
the change from rural to urban residence, experienced throughout the region, is not the result of migrants having been the low fertility segment of
the rural population prior to departure. On the contrary, there is evidence in some countries that female
rural-urban migrants tend to be women

 

Social Biology

who have experienced high fertility in
the past. The notion of gradual adaptation of migrants from the countryside
to the lower fertility of lifetime urban
residents is also not found in Africa:
The decline in migrant fertility to levels
approximating those of urban natives is
immediate (sometimes even preceding
migration), and migrants from rural areas do not take longer to experience
lower fertility than migrants from other
urban areas. This implies that, despite
the enormous difference in standard of
living between urban and rural areas in
virtually every African country, urban
and rural life may not differ so much
for women in terms of types or degree
of social contacts, economic activities,
living arrangements or other socioeconomic or cultural factors as to make
rapid personal adjustment to the new
environment difficult. Moreover, the
almost universal exposure of rural residents in Africa to aspects of urban life
through association with return migrants or their own circulation between
urban and rural areas probably results
in a high degree of what Hanna and
Hanna (1981) call ‘‘anticipatory socialization”” among prospective migrants
—an adoption of norms, values, and
behaviors associated with the urban
environment while the migrant is still
living in the village. In this context, low
migrant fertility in urban areas is not
unexpected.

While the commonly perceived consequences of heavy in-migration to
African cities—pressure on housing,
services, and income-earning opportunities—may be real, immediate and
persistent low migrant fertility in urban
areas suggests that urban migrants
have a more modest impact on longDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

term urban growth in the region than is
often argued (Adepoju, 1986). Moreover, the apparent reduction in fertility
that accompanies rural-urban migration implies that migration to cities
may contribute to lower national population growth, had migrants continued to have higher fertility in rural areas if they had not moved.
Limitations of the DHS data do not
allow one to explore in detail the social
or behavioral mechanisms through
which fertility patterns are modified at
different stages of the migration process. Nevertheless, the findings presented here clearly show that migrant
fertility does undergo dramatic change

over time and raise additional questions worthy of further research. Foremost among these are: Is female migration to African towns and cities for
long periods motivated by a desire to
have small families (i.e., low fertility)?
What is the extent and length of spousal separation associated with longterm female migration to urban areas?
To what extent do structural characteristics associated with urban environments limit the number of children a
woman or couple can have? Both indepth migration surveys and more
qualitative research approaches should
be considered in order to address these
questions satisfactorily.
