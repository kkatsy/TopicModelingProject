Intellectual Performance, Race, and

Socioeconomic Status

In studies that have compared whites
and Negroes on tests of intellectual performance, the Negroes have nearly always
scored lower than the whites. In the widely
cited study of 1,800 Negro school children
from five southeastern states, Kennedy,
Van de Reit, and White (1963) found a
mean IQ on the 1960 Stanford-Binet of
80.7 (S.D. 12.4).

The debate concerning the extent to
which such group differences in performance are the result of environmental
differences (whether prenatal or postnatal)
or genetic differences in potential is by
no means new (see Peterson, 1923), and
interest in the subject has been maintained by recent articles favoring both
genetic (Jensen, 1969) and environmental
(e.g., Scarr-Salapatek, 1971) hypotheses.

Since many of the environmental and
cultural variables that are thought to affect
performance are not distributed equally
among the white and Negro populations
(Gottesman, 1968), it is difficult to make
meaningful comparisons. Meehl (1969)
has argued that matching for some of
these “nuisance variables,” besides being
impractical, may result in the systematic
unmatching for some other variables or in
the generation of quite unrepresentative
subsamples.

The matching problem is even more
complex since membership in different
socioeconomic groups may itself be partly
the result of genetic differences. The high
heritability, or proportion of variance due
to genetic factors, found for intelligence
in most populations studied (Jensen,
1969) together with a high degree of positive assortative mating has led Burt (1961)
and others to suggest that in a society
that gives most members an opportunity
to rise (or drop) in social class based on
their ability, one’s socioeconomic status
as an adult is partly the indirect result
of genetically influenced intelligence. Thus,
matching for social class may result in controlling for both environmental and genetic
factors.

Among children, unfavorable environmental conditions, such as may be expected in families having low socioeconomic
ratings, do lead to lower mean IQ’s. Studies
both of foster children (e.g., Skodak and
Skeels, 1949) and of identical twins raised
apart (e.g., Newman, Freeman, and Holzinger, 1937) have shown a relationship
between environmental ratings and IQ,
suggesting a direct effect of social and
cultural conditions on the measured IQ’s
of children.

by Niswander and Gordon (1972), is a
longitudinal study conducted by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases
and Stroke. The population was selected
from women registering for prenatal care
in 12 university medical centers. Most of
the women were clinic patients; 45% were
white, 47% Negro, and the rest a variety
of other ethnic groups, mostly Puerto
Rican. Race was identified on the basis of
the mother’s report, and no attempt was
made to assess the amount of racial mixture in the children. Interdisciplinary project personnel followed the women extensively during pregnancy and delivery and

examined the children periodically through
age eight years. Each child has been assigned a socioeconomic index score based
on parental occupation, education, and income data obtained during a prenatal interview (Myrianthopoulos and French, 1968).

The subjects for the present investigation were two large geographic samples of
children from this longitudinal study. The
distribution of scores on the socioeconomic
index differed significantly between the two
samples, but within the samples, the scores
of the whites and Negroes were nearly
identical (Figure 1). The lower socioeconomic sample was composed of children of

Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
The parents of the Negro children (90%
of the sample) and white children (10%)
had socioeconomic index scores that were
similar to but slightly higher than scores
of heads of households aged 15 to 44, based
on 1960 census data, in the total United
States Negro population (see Myrianthopoulos and French, 1968). The mean
score, on a scale of 0-95, was approximately
40 for both whites and Negroes. The median annual family income, based on data
obtained during prenatal interviews between 1959 and 1965, was about $3,400.
The average maternal education was just
over ten years for the Negroes and nine
and one-half years for the whites. The
father was absent from the home in about
10% of the white families but in nearly
25% of the Negro families. The proportion
of fathers who were professionals or college
students was under 5%. Approximately
60% of the whites and 70% of the Negroes
were semiskilled or unskilled laborers.
The higher socioeconomic sample consisted of children of mothers who registered
for prenatal care at Boston Lying-In Hospital, where the parents of the white children (90% of the sample) and Negro children (10%) had socioeconomic index scores
distributed similarly to the scores of heads
of households aged 15 to 44 in the total
United States white population. The mean
score was 60 for both whites and Negroes.
The median family income was somewhat
higher among the Negroes: $5,500 vs.
$5,000 per year for the white families.
Both the white and Negro mothers had
completed an average of nearly twelve
years of education. The father was absent
from the home in about 3% of the white
families and 7% of the Negro families. The
occupational status of the fathers was
higher than in the Baltimore-Philadelphia
sample. Approximately 16% of the whites

369

and 12% of the Negroes had professional
or technical jobs. Nearly 10% of the whites
but only about 2% of the Negro fathers
were enrolled in college or graduate schools;
one-half of the Negroes and 35% of the
whites were semiskilled or unskilled laborers.

In both samples, the patients’ charges
for prenatal and obstetrical care were based
on their ability to pay. The Baltimore and
Philadelphia hospitals are located near the
center of the cities, while the Boston hospital is near the suburb of Brookline.

Each child in the study was given two
individually administered IQ tests, the
Stanford-Binet (short form L-M) at age
four and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale
for Children (four verbal and three performance tests) at age seven. To maintain
high scoring accuracy, all examinations
were edited by a second examiner and again
as they were received in the Perinatal Research Branch in Bethesda. To help insure
comparable techniques of test administration and scoring among examiners at different study centers and to assess testretest reliability, quality control trials were
held regularly, in which randomly selected
children were retested after three month
intervals by an examiner from one of the
other eleven hospitals involved in the Collaborative Study. The original examiner
observed the second test and scored it independently. A total of 140 four-year-olds
and 371 seven-year-olds from the twelve
study centers were retested. For both the
four- and seven-year exams, test-retest correlations were approximately 0.84, while
concurrent interscorer correlations were
0.98.

The distribution of scores on the fouryear exam is presented by sample, race,
and three socioeconomic intervals in Table
1. The percentage of cases within the three
socioeconomic intervals reflected the difference in the composition of the two samples.

For example, in the Boston sample, 54%
had socioeconomic index scores between 60
and 95, while in the Baltimore-Philadelphia
sample, only 14% of the scores were in this
interval.

When the IQ’s of the large “representative” groups (i.e., whites from Boston and
Negroes from Baltimore and Philadelphia)
are compared, the mean difference (15.4
points) is about one standard deviation,
not unlike that found in scores of other
such studies (Shuey, 1966). However,
within the geographic samples, where Negroes and whites having more similar socioeconomic characteristics can be compared,
the average difference on this test was 6.0
points in Boston and 4.2 points in the Baltimore-Philadelphia sample. The IQ distributions are shown graphically in the left
side of Figure 2.

Within each sample, the Negro-white difference averaged about 34 points among
children in the first two socioeconomic intervals and approximately 7-8 points
among children with socioeconomic index
scores between 60 and 95. The greater relationship between the IQ of children and
the socioeconomic status of parents among
whites was also observed by Scarr-Salapatek (1971). This finding is consistent
with the hypothesis that whites have had
a greater opportunity to change in social
status on the basis of their individual abilities, including IQ. Therefore, the socioeconomic index would be correlated with parents’ IQ to a greater extent among whites
than among Negroes, and a corresponding
effect upon children’s IQ (like that observed here) would be expected.

The observation that Negro-white differences are relatively small between samples
having comparable socioeconomic distributions indicates that the larger differences
frequently discussed must be interpreted
with caution. However, the observation by
itself does not permit a distinction among

genetic, environmental, or combined explanations. The following indirect evidence
suggests that in the Negro samples, environmental components form a major part
of the socioeconomic effect on IQ. A study
of Collaborative Study data from all twelve
study centers (Nichols, 1970) showed that
the sib-sib correlation for the four-year
IQ was significantly lower among Negroes
than among whites. The simplest interpretation appeared to be that the heritability
of IQ, which depends on the population and
associated environmental conditions, was
relatively low in the Negro sample. The
theory that differences in performance
among socioeconomic groups are partly
genetically determined assumes a high heritability of intelligence. Therefore, a lower
heritability of intelligence in the Negro
sample is consistent with a smaller genetic
and larger environmental component of
the socioeconomic effect on IQ.

White or Negro children within any socioeconomic interval from the Boston sample had IQ’s that averaged approximately
eight points higher than children of the
same race and socioeconomic level from the
Baltimore-Philadelphia sample (Table 1).
A small part of this difference between
samples may have arisen from the three
broad socioeconomic categories used. For
example, within the 60-95 interval, the
mean socioeconomic index score in Boston
was about 75, compared to 68 in the Baltimore-Philadelphia sample. The remainder
of the sample difference may be the result
of more subtle cultural influences than can
be measured by the index. This possibility
could also help to account for the remaining
race effect.

The distribution of scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children given at
age seven is shown on the right side of
Figure 2, and Table 2 presents the distribu

tions of the verbal, performance, and full
scale IQ’s. The mean scores for all groups
were slightly lower on the WISC than on
the Stanford-Binet, due in part to the lower
ceiling on the WISC. The samples at seven
years were smaller, since results from these
tests are still being processed, so the data
have not been separated into the three socioeconomic intervals. The Negro-white differences were slightly less at age seven
than at age four: approximately four points
within each sample. This result is consistent with studies (Shuey, 1966, Kennedy,
1969) that indicated stability in Negro
children’s IQ’s, and supports the conclusion
that earlier findings (e.g., Kennedy et al.,
1963) of a negative relationship between
age and IQ in Negro children were due to
artifacts of sampling.

Other comparisons can be made using
the percentage distributions in Tables 1
and 2. For example, among four-year-olds
in the Baltimore-Philadelphia sample, the
proportion with IQ’s below 70, the usual
criterion for mental retardation, was 4%
among the whites and 6% among the Negroes. Of the four-year-olds in the Boston
sample, only 1% of the children of either
race were retarded (Table 1). Similar results were found for the children at age
seven: 2% of the white children and 4%
of the Negro children from Baltimore and
Philadelphia were retarded. Again, only
1% of the children of either race from
Boston were retarded (Table 2).

In the sample of Kennedy et al. (1963),
11% of the five- to seven-year-old Negro
children examined had IQ’s below 70. However, it should be remembered that their
sample was drawn from a different geographic area. Perhaps a more practical
definition of retardation should consider
the distribution of scores in the particular
sample. For example, on both the Stanford
Fic. 2.—Distribution of IQ’s at age 4 and age 7 by geographic sample and race.

Binet and the Wechsler, an IQ of 70 was
approximately 2.4 standard deviations below the mean of the Boston sample, but
only about 1.7 standard deviations below
the mean of the Baltimore-Philadelphia
sample. And in Kennedy’s sample, an IQ
of 70 was only nine-tenths of one standard
deviation below the population mean of
80.7.

In the present study, racial differences
in intellectual performance in samples of
young white and Negro children whose
parents had similar socioeconomic scores,
lived in the same city and had gone to the
same hospitals for prenatal care were much
smaller than often reported. The fact that
differences were minimized by comparing
samples of children with similar socioeconomic scores suggests that socioeconomic

factors are largely responsible for the usually reported Negro-white differences in
intellectual performance.
