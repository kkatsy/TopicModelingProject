An Evaluation of Survey Data

“ABSTRACT: The 1986 experimental Demographic and Health Survey in the Dominican Republic

as one of the first retrospective, population-based surveys of a developing country to collect
gnformation on prematurity status as well as birthweight. We show that the relationships among
“birthweight, prematurity status, and infant mortality are consistent with corresponding patterns
‘@bserved in other Latin American and Caribbean countries and in developed nations. Two

otable irregularities in the birthweight data are the atypically high proportion of infants
oaveighing 4,000 grams or more, and the high mortality rates among infants with missing
birthweight. Problems with the prematurity status data include an unexpectedly low proportion
<of premature births, an unusually small proportion of low birthweight explained by premature
“births, and an extremely high neonatal death rate among premature compared to term infants.
dnclusion of an explicit definition of “premature”? may help avert similar problems in future

 

‘health surveys.

Birthweight and gestational age are
«well-known indicators of an infant’s
thealth at birth and are highly predicive of morbidity and mortality in the
first few months of life (Thomson,
4983; Luchenco et al., 1972; McCormick, 1985). Most studies of the relaions among birthweight, gestational
age, and infant mortality have been
“pased on data from vital registration
Sources in developed countries. OpFportunities to study these relations in
developing countries have been fairly
limited, however, because data on
birthweight and gestation length are
rarely available for national samples in
these populations.

Several studies of birthweight and
infant mortality in developing countries have been based on birthweight
information that was collected at the
time of birth (Puffer and Serrano,
1987; Villar and Belizan, 1982; Mar
Michiga

 

torell and Gonzalez-Cossfo, 1987). A
major disadvantage of each of these
analyses is that the data were collected
from a small number of hospitals which
may not be representative of all births
in the national target population. Studies of prematurity in developing countries are even less common and are
subject to similar types of selections
biases (Villar and Belizan, 1982; Martorell and Gonzalez-Cossio, 1987).

In order to obtain national-level information on these important indicators of health at birth, several recent
surveys in developing countries have
included questions on birthweight. The
resulting evaluations of the usefulness
of the information offer mixed findings. A study of birthweight data from
the Malaysian Family Life Survey concluded that retrospectively recalled
data provided worthwhile information
on birthweight patterns in spite of

131

132

missing information and response error (DaVanzo et al., 1984). An analysis of data from the Demographic and
Health Survey in Peru demonstrated
that data on birthweight appeared to
be internally consistent, but that the
high nonresponse rate to the birthweight question led to biases in the estimated incidence of low birthweight
and in the estimated relations among
birthweight, mortality, and their sociodemographic correlates (Moreno and
Goldman, 1990).

Our study analyses data on birthweight and prematurity status from a
recent survey in the Dominican Republic. The principal objective is to assess whether retrospectively recalled
data on these variables are accurate indicators of what they are intended to
measure. We evaluate the data by examining distributions of birthweight
and prematurity status and patterns of
mortality by these two variables, and
by comparing the resulting estimates
with available data from other sources,
including other sample surveys in developing countries, vital registration,
and clinical studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this analysis are from
the experimental questionnaire of the
1986 Dominican Republic Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).
The general objective of this survey
was to resolve a number of methodological issues in survey research in
connection with the measurement of
fertility, contraception, child health,
and child mortality by using an “‘experimental” questionnaire in conjunction
with the standard questionnaire previously developed for the Demographic

Miller et al.

Social Biology

and Health Survey program (Westoff
et al., 1990). The DHS program has
conducted national health surveys using the standard questionnaire in more
than three dozen developing countries
since the mid-1980’s. The main innovation of the experimental questionnaire was the inclusion of a six-year
monthly calendar that collected information on pregnancies, contraceptive
use, postpartum behavior, marriage,
residence, and employment information. An additional feature of the experimental questionnaire was the inclusion of questions on birthweight and
prematurity status that were not part of
the standard questionnaire.

A national stratified sample of
about 12,000 Dominican women aged
15~49 was selected, approximately
two-thirds of whom received the standard questionnaire and one-third (N =
3,885) the experimental questionnaire.
Since most fertility, mortality, and
health-related information was obtained only for births in 1981 or later,
the sample used in this analysis consists
of the 2,714 singleton, live births between January 1981 and December,
1986).

Unless otherwise noted, the numbers cited here are based on the unweighted sample. However, for the figures to be nationally representative of
the Dominican Republic, they must be
weighted according to the weights calculated as part of the sampling design.!
Details of the sampling design are
given in Consejo Nacional de Pobla
1A two-stage stratified cluster design was used to
obtain a self-weighted sample within each of the
country’s eight administrative health regions. Each
region was also stratified by urban and rural areas.
AS a consequence, weights must be used to calculate
national-level estimates.

cién y Familia, (1987). We use
weighted statistics when comparing
rates from the Dominican Republic
with those from other countries, but
not for the purposes of assessing the internal consistency of the data. Where
weighted statistics are cited, we also
provide the unweighted figures for
comparison. |
Mothers were asked to recall the
‘birthweight of their infants in pounds
Sand ounces. We have converted birthQveight into grams in order to facilitate
comparison with other studies. A total
@f 10.2 per cent of births lack a reorted numerical birthweight. Inforation on prematurity status was collected with the question: ‘““When [your
“baby] was born, was he/she ontime or
Premature?” Unfortunately, no spetific gestation length was used to explain what was meant by “‘premature.”’
3 Duration of gestation is evaluated
“during prenatal care in the Dominican
Republic by measuring uterine height
Hay, 1988). Although nearly 95 per
rent of births in our sample were to
-women who received prenatal care
Arom a physician or trained nurse, we
do not know whether they were in‘gormed of their infants’ gestational age
At the time of the birth. As a conseajuence, we term the mother’s report of
prematurity status “subjective” to distinguish it from gestational ages known
to be based on standard means of assessment and recorded on medical
records or in a vital registration system. The standard WHO definition of
premature (or preterm) birth refers to
a gestation length of less than 37 completed weeks since last menstrual period. A subjective assessment of prematurity status was available for all but
one infant in the Dominican Republic

sample. Since gestational age is more
difficult to assess than birthweight, it
seems unlikely that this near-complete
reporting of prematurity status is a reflection of accuracy.

RESULTS
BIRTHWEIGHT

The birthweight distribution (Table
1) exhibits the expected shape, with
the modal weight category (3,0003,499 grams) accounting for roughly
one-third of all births, and few births
weighing less than 1,500 grams. However, the proportion of births with reported weights of 4,000 grams or more
(95% confidence interval = 12.2% +
1.2; 12.9% unweighted) is higher than
that reported for Mexico (2.8% +
0.7), Brazil (4.6%), Costa Rica (5.4%)
(Puffer and Serrano, 1987), and Malaysia (8.0% + 1.1) (Moreno and
Goldman, 1990).2 Only Sweden
(16.2%), New Zealand (12.2%)
(WHO, 1978) and Peru (13.3% + 1.8)
(Westoff et al., 1990) exhibit proportions of births over 4,000 grams comparable to that in the Dominican Republic sample. We note that the figure
for Peru is probably overstated, since
lighter infants were under-represented
among those with reported numerical
birthweights (Westoff et al., 1990).

The estimated proportion of low
birthweight (LBW) infants (weighing

2Sampling errors (and thus confidence intervals)
cannot be calculated for some of the comparison
countries because the statistics are based on the full
population of births from a given year, rather than
a sample. Sampling errors are given for estimates
based on sample surveys only and are based on the
assumption of simple random sampling. Because
design effects are not taken into account, our estimates of the variance are probably too low.

fewer than 1 per cent of births in the adjacent weight
range (plus or minus one-half pound). This heaping
is part of a commonly observed tendency to report
birthweights that are multiples of .one-quarter or
one-half pound or of 500 grams (David, 1980). Infants with reported weights of 5.5 Ibs. are not included in the LBW estimate.

what lower than those observed in
Peru and Mexico. The figure for Puerto Ricans in the United States (9.1
per cent) is quite close to that for the
Dominican Republic.

The mean (weighted) birthweight
for the Dominican Republic sample
(3,315 grams) is somewhat higher than
the mean birthweight observed in the
Peru and Mexico Demographic and
Health Surveys (3,223 and 3,267
grams, respectively) (Moreno and
Goldman, 1990) but slightly below the
mean weight for the United States
based on vital statistics (3,370 grams)
(NCHS, 1987). Median birthweight in
the Dominican Republic (3,184 grams)
is also quite close to that for U.S.
blacks and Puerto Ricans (3,170 and
Vol. 40, No. 1-2

3,190 grams, respectively; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1986); the median for U.S.
whites is 3,410 grams.

In accordance with expectations,
the distributions of births across 500gram birthweight groups differ considerably by subjective prematurity status
(Figure 1): Roughly half of premature
infants are reported as weighing less

—than 2,500 grams, compared to only
Sabout 6 per cent of term births. Mean
weighted) birthweights for premature
Fand term infants are 2,459 and 3,352
rams, respectively. Sixteen per cent of
srreterm births and 10.0 per cent of
cterm births are missing information on
birthweight. Based on the results of
“other studies that suggest an association between nonreporting of birthSyeight and incidence of LBW (Moreno
and Goldman, 1990; David, 1980), it is
‘Slikely that the true differences between
‘the birthweight distributions for term
fand premature infants are even more
“pronounced than those shown in Fig

~. In order to determine whether certain subgroups of women were less
gikely to report a birthweight, we esti‘gnated multivariate logistic models of
aving a reported birthweight (not
Shown). These analyses demonstrate
Ahat infants delivered without professional medical assistance were only
about one-twentieth as likely to have a
reported birthweight as those delivered by doctors or nurses. This finding
suggests that many infants for whom
birthweight is missing were likely never
weighed (Miller et al., 1992).4 Less

“The extent to which mothers are able to report
birthweight appears to be directly related to the percentage of deliveries in the formal health system. In
the Dominican Republic, 10 per cent of infants

than 10 per cent of infants in the sample were delivered without professional medical assistance. Further, infants who died were less than half as
likely to have a reported birthweight as
those that survived. Mothers with no
education or with primary education
were only 30 per cent and 60 per cent
as likely to report a birthweight as
mothers with secondary or higher education. Women with less than a
secondary-level education constituted
nearly 70 per cent of the sample. Finally, mothers from rural areas were
only about half as likely to report a
birthweight as their urban counterparts.

PREMATURITY STATUS

Whereas the birthweight distribution reported for the Dominican Republic appears to be generally consistent with corresponding values
reported elsewhere, the reported level
of prematurity seems less so. The
(weighted) proportion of births reported as premature in the Dominican
Republic sample is 4.4 per cent + 0.8
(3.7 per cent unweighted), a value
which is slightly below levels reported
for Costa Rica and Chile, and markedly lower than values reported for the
United States, Uruguay, and Cuba
based on data from vital registration or
clinical records (Table 3).

In the Dominican Republic sample,
the incidence of prematurity is considerably below the incidence of LBW.
Prematurity is less common than LBW
in many populations because while

cent were delivered by a medical professional. The
corresponding figures from the Peru DHS sample
are 32 per cent and 56.3 per cent, respectively
(Westoff et al., 1990). The proportion of women
who received “modern” prenatal care in the Dominican Republic is higher than in most currently
developing countries.

most preterm infants are LBW, some
<term infants will also be LBW as a con“sequence of intrauterine growth retar“dation (Villar and Belizan, 1982).
However, further exploration of the
Mssociation between birthweight and
‘prematurity status raises additional
SSuspicion about the accuracy of the
‘Dominican Republic data. The extent
pf intrauterine growth retardation
4IUGR) is often approximated by the
‘proportion of overall LBW accounted
-for by term births (Kessel et al., 1982;
Ferraz et al., 1990). The Dominican
Republic stands out from the other six
ountries shown in Table 3 in that
Serm-LBW births account for a relaAively high percentage of the overall inCeidence of LBW in the Dominican Republic. More than 70 per cent of the
overall incidence of LBW is accounted
for by term births (75 per cent unweighted), compared to between 39
per cent and 66 per cent in the other
countries shown.

In their cross-national study, Villar
and Belizan (1982) do find other countries (e.g., India and Guatemala) in
which term infants account for 70 per
cent or more of the incidence of LBW.

However, those countries tend to have
LBW rates that are two to three times
as high as that observed in the Dominican Republic DHS sample.5 They
found that in countries with LBW incidence comparable to our estimate for
the Dominican Republic, preterm infants accounted for 55 per cent to 65
per cent of the overall incidence of
LBW. They concluded that when the
incidence of LBW is less than 10 per
cent, preterm infants represent the primary component of LBW. Because it is
generally considered to be more difficult to reduce the incidence of preterm
birth than the incidence of low birthweight, the combination of a low percentage of preterm births and a (relatively) high percentage of IUGR is
unlikely. These findings strongly suggest that the incidence of preterm birth
is understated in the Dominican Republic DHS data.

5Villar and Belizan (1982) estimate a 68 per cent
contribution of term LBW for the Dominican Republic in 1975-76, but that was associated with a
much higher estimate of the overall proportion of
LBW (17.8 per cent) than was observed in our
1981-96 sample. Their Dominican Republic sample
consisted of only 304 infants and was based on clinical records.

Multivariate analyses (not shown)
demonstrate that several characteristics of women and infants are significantly associated with reporting a preterm birth (see Miller et al., 1992 fora
more detailed presentation). First, infants born more than three years before the interview were only half as
likely to have been reported as premature as those born closer to the date of
interview. This finding suggests that
the mother’s impression of gestational
length fades with increasing time since
the birth. Second, infants of mothers
aged 35 or older were more than twice
as likely to be reported as premature
than infants of women aged 20-34.
While prematurity is often more common among births to older women, the
relative risks are generally not this
large (Ferraz et al., 1990). Finally, infants of rural women were only about
two-thirds as likely to be judged premature as their urban counterparts. A
differential of this size is surprising,
since it cannot be explained by differences in type of attendant at delivery or
education, both of which are controlled in the multivariate model.

MORTALITY

Because births that occurred within
a year of the survey were not exposed
to the risk of dying for a full year, life
table methods were used to estimate
mortality. The methods used to calculate the mortality rates and their associated standard errors are described
below. All tests of significance in this
paper are based on 2-sided tests.

Calculation of mortality rates.—
Monthly mortality rates (71, i = Q, ...,

month and P; the total exposure time
for that month. Infants for whom the
interview occurred A months after their
month of birth contributed & months of
exposure to P;, infants who were censored at age 0 months (i.e., the interview took place in the same month in
which they were born) contributed
0.33 months (Trussell et al., in press).
The amount of exposure contributed
by infants who died was calculated as
number of days up to 30 days and number of months thereafter.

The probabilities of dying in the first
month (,qg;—termed the ‘neonatal
mortality rate”) and the remainder of
the first year (,g;—the “‘post-neonatal
mortality rate’’) as well as in infancy
(246) were derived from the estimated
monthly rates as follows (ElandtJohnson and Johnson, 1980):

Note that the mortality rates are actually probabilities.

to derive the estimated variance of

1987):

Under the assumption that the mortality rates are constant within each single
month (and that censoring is independent of survival), the variance of 77, can
be estimated as follows (Cox and
Oakes, 1984):

var (mj) = -pi

 
Vol. 40, No. 1-2

Substitution of the estimates from
Equation (3) into Equation (2) and
taking square roots of the results provides the estimated standard errors
used to calculate the confidence intervals shown in Figures 2 and 3.

As shown in Figure 2a, the neonatal
mortality rate (NMR) declines sharply
with increasing birthweight from more
than 260 per 1,000 among infants

aweighing less than 1,500 grams to a
“minimum of about 12 for those in the
$B ,500-3,999 gram group, followed bya
Snoderate increase to 28 for infants
aveighing 4,500 grams or more. NMR
or infants under 1,500 grams are sigchificantly greater than those for instants weighing 1,500 grams or more
Ap < 0.05). Although the rates for infants in the next two categories (1,500Aj ,999 and 2,000-2,499 grams) are also
‘Substantially greater than those in the
heavier groups, the corresponding
“differences are not statistically signifi‘pant because of small sample sizes in

shows a similar decline with increasing
spirthweight, although the relative dif“ferences are smaller than in the neo“natal period and are not statistically
Significant.
© Mortality rates by birthweight and
prematurity status jointly are presented in Figure 3, along with their
95% confidence intervals. In the neonatal period, premature infants have
much higher mortality than infants
born on time, regardless of their low
birthweight status. For example, the
relative risk of neonatal death for preterm compared to term infants is 21.2
(p <0.01), while the corresponding
relative risk for LBW and normal

Birthweight and Prematurity Status

139

birthweight infants are 19.5 (p < 0.01)
and 14.3 (p<0.01), respectively.
LBW infants are at higher risk of neonatal death than their normal-weight
counterparts (RR=4.5, p<0.01).
LBW and premature infants also have
higher than average mortality in the
post-neonatal period, but the differentials are far smaller than in the neonatal period. The relative risk of
PNMR among preterm infants is 4.4
(p < 0.01), while the relative risk for
LBW infants is 3.2. Infants with missing birthweight have neonatal mortality rates quite close to those for LBW
infants (75 and 77 per 1,000, respectively; Figure 3a), but are characterized by more moderate mortality in the
post-neonatal period (44 per 1,000
compared to 79 per 1,000 for LBW infants; Figure 3b).

Among infants for whom both birthweight and prematurity status are
known, the infant mortality rate IMR)
is highest for infants reported to be
both LBW and preterm (397 per 1,000)
and lowest for normal-weight term infants (37 per 1,000) (not shown). These
patterns correspond well with those reported by Mata (1978) based on a sample of Guatemalan children. Within either weight group in the Dominican
Republic, the relative risk of infant
death for preterm versus term birth is
quite high: 5.0 and 7.4 among low and
normal weight infants, respectively
(p<0.01). The effects of higher reported birthweight on infant mortality
within each of the two prematurity status groups are much smaller (i.e., the
corresponding relative risks are not significantly greater than one at the 5 per
cent level). These results stand in contrast to evidence from several studies
discussed in Thomson (1983), which

demonstrate that when both variables
are considered together, the influence
of gestational age is small compared to
the effects of birthweight, and that increasing gestational age has its largest
effect among infants weighing at least
3,000 grams at birth. Furthermore, the
IMR for the preterm, normal-weight
group is far greater relative to the
IMR’s for the other weight/gestation
classes in the Dominican Republic than
has been observed elsewhere (Mata,
1978; Starfield et al., 1982).

Another notable finding is the extraordinarily high mortality among
premature infants for whom birthweight information is missing (857 and
199 per 1,000 for NMR and PNMR, respectively). A closer examination of

the data shows that nearly 80 per cent
of these infants died in their first week
of life (not shown). Infants in this
category thus constitute a very select
group, apparently composed of those
who were very unhealthy at birth and
may never have been weighed.

DISCUSSION

This study has analyzed the quality
of retrospectively recalled data on
birthweight and prematurity status that
were collected as part of the experimental questionnaire of the Demographic and Health Survey in the
Dominican Republic. Many of the relationships among birthweight, prematurity status, and infant mortality esti

3 Nevertheless, certain anomalies chare acterize the birthweight data and espees cially the prematurity data.

Two conspicuous irregularities in
the birthweight data are the atypically
high proportion of infants weighing
4,000 grams or more, and the high
mortality rates among infants with
missing birthweights, a finding which
Suggests that mothers were less likely
to provide birthweight information for
infants who died shortly after birth.
Birthweight was also less likely to be
reported by mothers with low educational attainment, rural residents, and

those who did not have professional
medical assistance at their delivery, all
high-risk subgroups. Because only
about 10 pr cent of births lacked a
birthweight in the Dominican Republic
sample, however, these missing data
should not Jead to substantial bias in
the estimated relations between socioeconomic and biodemographic variables and risk of low birthweight.
Several results suggest misreporting
of prematurity status. First, the proportion premature is lower than in
other countries with available data.
Also problematic is the small proportion of LBW explained by preterm
births in the Dominican Republic compared with other countries with a similar incidence of LBW. One possible

explanation for these patterns is that
the subjective cutoff used by the
women to define “premature” is lower
than the WHO standard of 37 weeks. If
this were the case, then infants classi
fied as premature in the Dominican
Republic study would constitute a
smaller higher-risk subgroup of all infants than if the standard criterion had
been applied.

Examination of mortality rates by
prematurity status and birthweight
casts added doubt on the quality of the
prematurity data. Particularly suspect
is the very high relative risk of neonatal

death among infants reported to have
been born prematurely compared to
those born on time. The relative risks
of mortality for preterm versus term
infants—for the entire sample and

within birthweight groups—are far
higher than those reported in other
studies and may reflect a tendency to
report retrospectively infants who died
in their first month as premature,
rather than a “true” effect of short gestation on the risk of dying. The high
relative risks for infants reported as
premature could also result from the
use of a low cutoff duration to define
preterm birth. Another piece of evidence that raises concern about the
quality of the prematurity status data is
that infants born more than three years
before the interview are only half as
likely to be reported as premature,
suggesting that the data may be affected by recall bias.

Despite these discouraging results,
our study does not rule out the possibility of collecting data on gestational
age through retrospective surveys. It is
quite possible that the inconsistencies
observed in the Dominican Republic
sample derive primarily from the absence of a definition of “‘premature.”’
We recommend that, in future surveys,
questions on gestational age include
prompts based on specific gestation
lengths (number of weeks or months)
in order to provide a consistent definition of the desired concept. Questions
of this type have been included in other
retrospective surveys. For example, in
the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth, a question on duration of
pregnancy was supplemented by a
question on whether the infant was
born before the expected due date, and
if so, by how many weeks (Center for
Human Resources Research, 1988). A
similar question was asked in Round II
of the Malaysian Family Life Survey
(RAND corporation).

We also recommend that all mothers be asked for their subjective assessment of prematurity status, in spite of
the misreporting problems described
above. This subjective information offers the analyst approximate estimates
for the potentially large fraction of
women who will not be able to recall a
numerical gestation length. An analysis of the experimental Demographic
and Health Survey in Peru indicated
that approximate assessments of the infant’s size at birth (e.g., very small, average, etc.) for the full sample of
births, combined with numerical estimates (available for only 68 per cent of
the sample), led to improved estimates
of the incidence and correlates of low
birthweight (Moreno and Goldman,
1990). The Peru findings suggest that
estimates of birthweight and gestational age based on a combination of
numerical and subjective information
are apt to be less biased than those
based solely on subsamples with the
relevant numerical information. Such
an approach would facilitate the study
of birthweight and gestational age in
countries where vital statistics are very
defective or nonexistent, or where the
number of births delivered in the formal health system is small. Coordination of these surveys with a nationally
representative study of data on birthweight and gestational age collected
at the time of the birth would also
contribute to our knowledge about the
quality of retrospectively recalled data
on these important determinants of infant health. Finally, discussion of the
concept of ‘‘on time” birth and its measurement in a focus-group setting could
provide important information about
the contexts in which high quality inVol. 40, No. 1-2

formation on gestational age could be
collected. For example, it may be unrealistic to expect accurate reporting
of prematurity status in populations
.where few women receive prenatal
care or calendar numeracy is poor.
