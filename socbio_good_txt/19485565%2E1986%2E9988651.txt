causes of infant death. Some of the very
same factors, such as infection or colonization by microorganisms, when occurring after birth, are called “‘exogeneous’? causes of death. Whether
occurring to the mother, and through
her to the fetus before birth, or occurring directly to the baby after birth,
many causes of infant death are environmental and theoretically modifiable.

The crucial question may not be should
we define neonatal death as death occurring by day 18 or by day 28, but
should we not just reformulate but also
reconceptualize the definition of neonatal mortality; and then, how do we muster our knowledge and resources to
avert the many infant deaths over
which, in some sense, we could exercise
control?

We agree with many of Geronimus’
comments (1986) and welcome the opportunity to clarify our stance and to further the general conceptual treatment of
neonatal mortality. While our initial focus was empirical (Poston and Rogers,
1985) and Geronimus’ comment (1986)
is theoretical, we would like to extend
these ideas to a more practical level.

Because the focus of our paper was to
determine the accuracy of neonatal and
postneonatal mortality rates as proxies
of endogenous and exogenous causes of
death, we maintained the endogenous/
exogenous distinction. Our results suggest that endogenous and exogenous
mortality rates are more accurate and
impart more information than neonatal

and postneonatal mortality rates. Thus,
Our intent was to evaluate the accuracy
of neonatal morality, not to develop a
new theory of infant mortality.

We are still inclined to maintain that
medical technology, emphasizing curative health care, has comparatively little
control over many deaths arising from
endogenous causes. New technology
has saved very-low birthweight neonates, sometimes through heroic measures, but we wonder whether infant
deaths are averted or merely prolonged
(see also Zdeb, 1982, p. 734). The effective reduction of infant mortality due to
maternal cigarette or alcohol consumption, or drug addiction, requires preventive intervention before birth, or during
pregnancy, not advanced medical technology after birth.

We see the need for a reconceptualization of neonatal mortality, but believe that this involves greater development, including the use of new data sets,
perspectives, and models. Only recently
have individual life styles and behaviors
(e.g., maternal alcohol and cigarette
consumption and drug abuse) been implicated as contributing to infant deaths.
New data sets, such as the National Natality Survey, which include information
on the mother as well as the infant, are
just becoming available. Nevertheless,
cause of death codes are still not detailed enough to determine the relative
impact of life style factors on death.
Therefore, such complex interrelations
are best studied through modelling techniques that incorporate current data to
develop new theory.
