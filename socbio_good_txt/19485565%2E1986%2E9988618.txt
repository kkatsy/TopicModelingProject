Number of Siblings, Family Background, and the
Process of Educational Attainment

ABSTRACT: Sociological research has found that educational attainment is the most important
known determinant of men’s occupational positions. Since the educational process occurs primarily while boys depend on their families, sociologists are increasingly interested in familial
influences on education. This paper concentrates on the number of siblings in the family, and
addresses two principal questions concerning the relation of sibship size to educational outcomes. First, controlling for family background characteristics, does sibship size affect men’s
educational attainment and, if so, where in the educational process is this effect most evident?
Second, among family variables, what is the relative importance of sibship size compared to the
father’s education, the father’s socioeconomic status, farm background, and a broken family?
Research was based on probability samples of 57,000 white men in the United States.

Sociologists have had a longstanding
research interest in the effects of size on
social organization and individual behavior. The large bodies of work on the
structural effects for organizations—be
they industrial, governmental, educational, military, or health services—of
changes in scale cannot have escaped

_the most casual observer of social re
search, nor can studies of the social effects of numerical growth and decline on
geographical units, like towns and cities,
have been widely ignored. Even at the
“micro” level, sociologists have done
detailed analyses of differences in inter
action patterns among small groups of °

varying size—differences that are not
lost on anyone who has, for example,
experienced both undergraduate
courses and doctoral seminars.

This traditional and productive emphasis on studying the effects of scale
makes it all the more surprising that systematic sociological research has skirted

around a detailed concern with the longterm consequences for individuals of
coming from families of different sizes
(however, see, Duncan, 1968; and Blau
and Duncan, 1965, Ch. 9). Social research on the long-term effects of the
family has come within a hair’s breadth
of focusing on family-size outcomes,
only to glance off in another direction—
a direction strongly dictated by a different theoretical preoccupation. This preoccupation has been the effect of
parental social class on individual life
chances.

What now leads me to an interest in
the long-term effects of family size?
Clearly, the demonstrated importance
of size for types of social groups other
than the family would be reason
enough. But, my curiosity has been particularly piqued because of a lifelong
commitment to research on the causes
and consequences of differential fertility. What are the long-term conse

quences for individuals of variability in
sibship size, taking account of a number
of background factors associated both
with the outcomes and with family size?
As I began to formulate what research
could be undertaken to answer such a
question, or provide some partial answers to it, J was led back to the very
body of distinguished and pioneering
work that had largely “skipped over”
it—the work on the effects of the family
on the intergenerational transmission of
social status. Since a great deal was already known about the effects of the
family on individual outcomes, the place
to start looking at possible long-term
family-size effects seemed to be where
one could build on prior knowledge and
data about other types of familial influences.

Over the past twenty-five years, replicated studies have found that educational attainment is the most important
known determinant of men’s occupational positions (see, for example, Blau
and Duncan, 1967; and Featherman and
Hauser, 1978). Because the educational
process occurs primarily while boys depend on their families, sociologists have
become increasingly attentive to familial influences on education (for example, Sewell and Hauser, 1975; Sewell et
al., 1976). What have they discovered?
Put very simply, they have found that
the father’s education is the most important family background predictor of the
son’s education. Holding constant factors such as race, the father’s education
plus his occupation plus the number of
children in the family have been
grouped together to indicate a major influence of family background on men’s
educational attainment. But, what of
the relative importance of number of siblings compared to father’s education
and father’s occupation? Given these re

searchers’ focus on social class effects, a
silence concerning the relative importance of family size is not surprising. A
number of major studies did not even include this variable in the analysis. At
best, family size has been viewed as a
control, measuring the differential dilution of parents’ personal and financial
resources, not an independent focus of
interest. What can be found when one
builds on this prior work, but shifts the
investigative focus to the effects of family size? |

In examining here some of the answers I have been discovering (Blake
19814; 1981b; 1985, and forthcoming), I
shall concentrate on the number of siblings in the parental families of adult
men who have completed their educations and address two principal questions. First, controlling for family background characteristics and the men’s
ages, did sibship size affect the men’s educational attainment and, if so, where in
the educational process was this effect
most evident? Second, among the family background variables, what is the relative importance of sibship size compared to the father’s education, the
father’s socioeconomic status, farm
background, and a broken family (the
background variables used in the analysis)?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The basic data for this analysis are the
1962 and 1973 surveys, Occupational
Changes in a Generation (OCG, 1962,
and OCG, 1973) conducted by the U.S.
Bureau of the Census, the General Social Survey 1973-1983 (GSS 72-83) conducted by the National Opinion Research Center of the University of
Chicago, and finally, the 1970 National
Fertility Study conducted by the Insti

tute for Survey Research at Temple
University (for the Office of Population
Research at Princeton University and
the Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin). The
OCG surveys were national probability
samples of men age 20-64 (OCG, 1962)
and 20-65 (OCG, 1973). The total number of respondents in 1962 was 20,700,
and in 1973, 33,613. The GSS is an annual probability sample of the adult
population of all ages. For men, the
pooled annual data (1972-83) total
6,984 respondents. The 1970 National
Fertility Study data were derived from a
probability sample of 6,752 evermarried female respondents aged 15-44
and concerned the women’s husbands.
Since the surveys oversampled blacks
and the present analysis focuses on
white males only, the total number of
cases is reduced somewhat for each
study, as is evident from the tables.
Even so, the analysis is based on 56,484
cases in all. In addition to scale, the research has the advantage of replication
on four separate data sets.

The family background variables
used as controls in the multivariate analysis that follows are of major theoretical
importance for educational attainment
and number of siblings. Fathers’ education and socioeconomic status have
been associated negatively with the
number of their offspring throughout
U.S. history, and whether the father was
a farmer (or worked on a farm) has been
positively associated with family size.
Equally, low parental education and socioeconomic status (and being a farmer
or farm worker) have been related to
low educational achievement for offspring. In general, coming from a broken family has had an independent negative effect on educational attainment,
reflecting primarily the income disad

vantage associated with being brought
up in a female-headed household. Coming from a broken family has been particularly prevalent among only children.
The respondent’s age, an indicator of
the period during which he grew up, is of
course negatively associated with educational attainment (since the latter has
risen over time), and positively associated with number of siblings (since the
long-run trend in family size has been
downward). In the present analysis, the
father’s socioeconomic status is measured by the Duncan socioeconomic index which converts detailed data on occupations into a continuous variable
(Reiss, 1961). None of the data sets included information on the respondent’s
intelligence. The possible significance of |
this omission will be discussed subse- .
quently. The term “‘sibsize” refers to the
number of individuals’ siblings. A man
with no siblings (an only child) is designated as coming from “‘sibsize 0,” a man
with one sibling comes from “sibsize 1,”
etc. The distribution, by sibsize, of the
men in each survey is shown in Table 1.

As for the dependent variables, initially I will discuss total years of educational attainment, and then break this
experience down into components—
years of graded schooling (0-12), proportions completing high school, proportions of high school graduates going
to college, and years of college schooling. In order to insure that men had
completed their educational experience, the analysis of total years of education (0-17+), and years of college
schooling, was based on men age 25 and
over. The remaining analyses were performed on men age 20 and over. If this
precaution had not been observed, a
spuriously positive association between
age and educational attainment among
younger men would have been evident

RESULTS

SIBSIZE AND TOTAL YEARS OF
EDUCATION

The upper tier of Figure 1 summarizes the bivariate relation between sibsize and total years of education for the
men in each survey. As may be seen,
there is a marked linear relationship between sibsize and total years of education attained. The somewhat less distinguished performance of the only child,
versus those having one sibling, is due to
the effect of disproportionate numbers
of broken families among only children.

The correlation ratios (etas) for the
data presented in Figure 1 range between 0.298 and 0.389. Table 2 indicates
that the difference in educational attainment between only children and those
having six or more siblings is, in most
surveys, close to a standard deviation.

bined, this difference is 0.94 of a standard deviation. A less extreme comparison, contrasting respondents from
two-child versus four-child (or larger)
families (Table 2), shows that the difference ts still very large—on average, 0.71
of a standard deviation.

Another way of looking at sibsize differences is to compare them with other
types of variability in educational attainment to which we customarily attach importance, such as differences by race
and age. During the mid-1970’s in the
United States, the black/white differential in years of education among men
was 1.7 years (Current Population Reports, 1977). By age, the differential between those aged 25-29 and those aged
60-64 was 1.1 years among white men.
During a comparable time period, our
analysis of the GSS 1972-83 data (Figure 1 and Table 3) shows that the educational gap between white men who were
only children and those who had six or
more siblings was 3.5 years. The gap for
white men in the OCG 1973 study was
3.2 years. In effect, the difference be

*The background factors used to adjust the means in each of the studies are father’s SEI, father’s education, farm background, respondent’s age, and family intactness. The Ns for each analysis have been reduced due to nonresponse on the dependent variable, educational attainment, and exclusion of respondents under age 25.

GSS 1972-83 study, and 2.4 years for
men in OCG 1973.

In fact, as racial and age differences
in educational attainment have lessened
over time, sibsize differences in such attainment (which have remained relatively constant) have become comparatively more important for people’s life
chances. This is evident when we make
the same comparisons for the 1950's as
we made for the 1970’s. During the mid1960’s in the United States, the black/
white educational differential among
men was 3.3 years and the difference between older and younger men (those
25-29 and 55-64) was 2.9 years (Current
Population Reports, 1966). These race
and age differences in education were
markedly greater than those for the
1970’s, but the sibsize differences in
OCG, 1962, were virtually identical to
those for OCG, 1973.

Obviously, the variability in educational attainment by sibsize is not assignable entirely to the fact of sibsize alone.
These differences are partly a function
of other family characteristics known to
be associated both with sibsize and with
people’s educational attainment. As has
been discussed earlier, we have controlled in so far as possible for the same
background variables in each survey
(see lower tier of Figure 1). We have
used the respondent’s age, the parental
family’s socioeconomic status as measured by the father’s score on the Duncan SEI index, the father’s educational
attainment, whether the family was intact, and farm background as controls in
a multiple classification analysis.

Although controlling for these background variables reduces the sibsize differentials somewhat, they continue to
be impressive. Table 3 compares the difDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

ferences in the bivariate and adjusted
means for only children and those from
families of seven or more; and for those
from two-child families and those of
four or more children. These results
show that, even after adjustment, the
difference for men between only children and those from families of seven or
more 1s approximately two years of total
education in relation to a grand mean of
between 11 and 12 years, depending on
the study. The adjusted sibsize differ~ence between the smallest and largest
families thus equals or exceeds the bivariate black-white difference among
men during the 1970’s in the United
States referred to previously. The difference in adjusted means between men
from families of two children and four or
more is just slightly less than the bivariate black-white difference for men.

SIBSIZE AND THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS

At what point, or points, in the process of acquiring an education does sibsize intervene most importantly? Because of free schooling and compulsory
education in the United States, one
might think that the dilution of family
resources resulting from many children
would make little difference to educational attainment through high school,
but that, after high school, sibsize would
be a major determinant of who would go
to college. Actually, our results are
quite different from common-sense expectations. Sibsize has a major effect on
educational attainment even during
graded schooling (0-12). In fact, as we
shall see, in most studies attainment is
more highly correlated with sibsize at
the graded level of schooling than at the
postsecondary level.

Consequently, another aspect of the
importance of sibsize for educational attainment is that it has exerted its effects

Siblings and Educational Attainment 11

early in the schooling process. It has operated to select out a high proportion of
students prior to high-school graduation, thereby cutting them off from further academic advancement. This finding suggests that sibsize operates not
simply by diluting parental economic resources for postsecondary schooling,
but by impinging on basic education at
the graded level in a manner that includes both economic and noneconomic
effects.}

Years of Graded Schooling.—Figure
2 shows, for all of our adult studies, the
adjusted means for total years of graded
schooling (0-12) by sibsize. As between
only children and those from families of
seven or more, it is typical for men to
have lost a year or more of graded
schooling. In judging the importance of
such a deficit (all other factors in our
analysis controlled), we must bear in
mind that the loss of a year of graded
schooling inevitably translated into
large proportionate decrements in highschool graduation. Hence, the loss of a
year of graded schooling, on average,
can be judged as very significant because
of the importance of completing the last
year of high school. We shall consider
this next. 
Proportions Graduating from High
School._—The unadjusted percentages
graduating from high school according
to sibsize are shown in the top tier of Figure 3, As can be seen, the magnitude of
the differences between small and large
families is very great. The absolute difference among men between one-child

‘Clearly, there are real costs attached to keeping youngsters at school even through high school,
since the child’s time represents an opportunity
cost for the parents and the child must be fed and
clothed. Nonetheless, it does seem farfetched to
suggest that children from large families drop out
of graded schooling for economic reasons alone.

and seven-child (or larger) families varies between 27 and 41 percentage points
(Table 4). Thus, among men, a comparison of one- or two-child and seven-ormore—child families shows small families to have about twice the proportion
of high-school graduates as large families. Those from two-child families, as
against those from families of four or
more children, typically exhibit a 25 percentage point differential.

Turning to the adjusted means (the
lower tier of Figure 3), the sibsize differences are somewhat attenuated but the
relationship is more linear since some of
the special disadvantages of only children are controlled. Despite the theoretical importance of the background
variables for which we have adjusted, it
is clear that the sibsize differences in
high-school graduation remain large.
Singleton boys are half again, or close to
half again, as likely to graduate from
high school as boys from families of
seven children or more. The percentage

Siblings and Educational Attainment 13

point differences in high-school graduation between singletons and those from
families of seven or more, and between
those from two child families and those
from families of four or more children,
are summarized in Table 4.

These data thus strongly reinforce
the finding that total educational differentials by sibsize do not simply reflect
relative advantage and disadvantage after high-school graduation. Even in the
graded schooling years, and with major
parental background variables controlled, increasing sibsize has deleterious consequences for educational at-.
tainment.

If the precocity of selection seems
strange to some readers, they should refer to an article by Suter (1980) which
deals with part of the process by which
such early selection comes about. As Suter makes clear, the major reason so
many men in the United States did not
finish high school was because they fell
behind (were “left back’) early on—

often in grade school. Even after the advent of compulsory schooling to ages
15-16 (depending on the state), such
men did not simply drop out of high
school, they dropped out of lower
grades in which they had remained until
the school-leaving age came around.
Postsecondary Education.—Among
the selected population of high-school
graduates, we see in Figure 4 that attendance at college (percentage of highschool graduates who went to college) is
also influenced by sibsize (background
factors controlled). Interestingly, however, among large sibsizes (sibsizes 5
versus 6-plus) in particularly, there is
less difference than there is for proportions graduating from high school. This
suggests that, among these large sibsizes, the high-school selection left a
population of “survivors”? who had
about equal chances of getting to college. In effect, the differences in life
chances between being from a six-child,
or a seven-plus—child family had already
been partialed out at the high-school
level. Table 5 shows the percentages

the case of each study, shows the percentage of men completing 8 years of
schooling by sibsize groupings. Notonly —
do these percentages drop as sibsize increases, but those from sibsizes 7+ suffer a precipitous drop even at this low
level of schooling, and those at sibsize 46 are well below those from small and
medium sibsizes. The second row shows
the percentage of all men who graduate
from high school. Again, not only do the
percentages decline as sibsize increases,
but they decline very markedly as one
goes from sibsizes 2~3 to 4-6 and 7+.
For example, in OCG 1962, 81.5 per
cent of those from sibsizes 0-1 had graduated from high school, but only 34.8
per cent of those from sibsizes 7+ had
done so. Comparable figures for OCG,
1973, are 87.8 and 44.0 per cent, and for
GSS 72-83, they are 91.6 and 48.7 per
cent. Finally, if we ask what percentage
of the men, by sibsize, ever went to college, we find that, in OCG, 1962, it is
48.2 per cent for sibsizes 0-1 and 11.3
per cent for sibsizes 7+. For OCG,

If men have managed to enter college, does sibsize affect the number of
years of college schooling they have

' been able to achieve? Figure 5 for the

men in each study shows that the effects
of sibsize are relatively small for this select group. That these effects exist at all,
given the process of prior selection by
sibsize that we have withessed, is quite
remarkable.

THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF SIBSIZE ON
GRADED AND SECONDARY EDUCATION

Our results so far, using Multiple
Classification Analysis, suggest that as
the level of schooling rises the effect of
number of siblings decreases. The truth

of this is most succinctly exemplified by
the unstandardized regression coefficients (slopes) for sibsize at each educational level. These are shown in Table
6. From this table it is clear that the effect of sibsize diminishes with each level
of schooling, the greatest effect being at
the graded-schooling level. We have
suggested that the selection against
large families that occurs so early in the
educational process is probably due to
two factors. One, outright schoolleaving (dropping out) among those
from large families, and two, being
“left-back” in high proportions among
those from large families until droppingout occurs at a legally permissible age.
Here we may note that this selection has
important methodological implications

ber of siblings among juniors and seniors in high school, or among college
populations. Such populations will have
been already strongly selected by number of siblings at an earlier stage in the
educational process.

THE IMPORTANCE OF S1RsIZE RELATIVE
TO OTHER FAMILY BACKGROUND
VARIABLES

As was noted earlier, the effects of
sibsize, relative to the effects of other

family background variables, have
tended to be understated by students of
social stratification who investigate the
consequences of family background for
educational opportunity.

One reason for investigators’ underestimating the relative importance of
number of siblings is that the influence
of this variable is often incorporated
into the overall influence of family background or “home”’ effects (so-called
ascriptive influences) versus the responDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

Vol. 33, No. 1-2

dent’s own characteristics and performances (viewed as meritocratic). Thus absorbed into “background,” number of
siblings serves to overestimate the importance of paternal socioeconomic status (SES) and turn attention away from
sibsize as an independent influence. For
example, the following quotation from
Alexander and Eckland is fairly typical
of discussion of even those studies that
have specifically included number of siblings as a predictor (Alexander and Eckland, 1980, p. 35).

More recent research, in revealing the
range of advantages and liabilities conferred by the family of origin, serves only
to broaden and deepen our appreciation
of the residue of ascription in the supposed meritocracy (Blau and Duncan,
1967; Duncan et al., 1972; Hauser and
Featherman, 1977).

To what is this persistent importance of
the family attributed? Largely, it appears, to the simple fact that children
from high SES families tend to go further
through school than their low SES counterparts, and hence reap the labor market
benefits that advanced schooling accrues.

A second reason for underestimating
the relative importance of number of
siblings to an individual’s attainment is
that models of status attainment (including those used here) treat parental SES
as exogenous—in no way influenced by
parental reproductive behavior. Yet parental educational attainment and occupational achievement are not independent of parental age at marriage and
childbearing, including number of children. Hence, to the extent that parental
SES is itself influenced by numbers of
children, the effect of the respondent’s
sibsize on measures of parents’ education and occupation is not counted.

Additionally, in so far as investigators have studied the educational process among high-school students (for ex
Siblings and Educational Attainment 17

ample, the high-school seniors in the
Wisconsin Study, or the National] Longitudinal Study of the High School Senior
Class of 1972), the importance of number of siblings to postsecondary educational goals and attainment will appear
relatively small (compared to other variables) because of the selection process
by sibsize that has already taken place.
Many youngsters from large families
have already dropped out (or been held
back), leaving a selected group of survivors from these families, whereas those
from small families are less selected.

Finally, as a number of critics have
noted (Scarr and Weinberg, 1977; Williams, 1976; and Spaeth, 1976) parental
socioeconomic status is itself, in part,
the translation of parental ability into
socioeconomic currency. Were it possible to control for parental ability, the effect of parental SES on the son’s
achievement would probably be less and
an additional effect of the parental ability transmitted to the child would be
added. This point, which is increasingly
being addressed by economists and sociologists (see, for example, Griliches,
1970; Griliches and Mason, 1972; Taubman and Wales, 1974; Welch, 1974; Bowles, 1973; Bowles and Nelson, 1974;
Bowles and Gintis, 1974; Eckland,
1967; Griffin, 1976; Hauser and Daymont, 1977) cannot be discussed further
here.

Here we will examine the relative effects of sibsize and other background
variables for the adults in some of our
samples. Table 7 shows, for OCG, 1962,
and 1973 as well as GSS 1972-1983, the
standardized coefficients of the principal variables in our model for each level
of the respondent’s educational attainment. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that the standardized coefficients

(using the basic educational attainment

model for adults) have been presented. _

Among the variables in the model, it
is clear in all the surveys, that the father’s education ts the most important
influence on the son’s total educational
attainment. In this regard, the following
quotation from Hauser and Featherman’s analysis of total educational attainment in the two OCG studies is
worth noting (1976, p. 105):

... We have not shown any standardized regression coefficients; some readers
may be interested to know that in virtually every subpopulation we have looked
at, father’s education is relatively more
important than any other background
variable.

In both OCG, 1973, and GSS, 1972-83,
sibsize is second in importance and outweighs, in negative effect, the positive
effect of the father’s socioeconomic index (SEI) (the third most important influence). In OCG, 1962, sibsize is closeto the father’s SEI and probably would
also exceed it in this study as well were it
not for the anomalously high SEI (see
Hauser and Featherman, 1976, p. 104
for mention of the fact that there seems
to be some inflation of the OCG, 1962,
SEI score for the father).

Turning to the relative status of the
variables in the disaggregated process of
education, we find some interesting
results. Among the educational levels,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 33, No. 1-2

the relative influence of the father’s education and sibsize is greatest for graded
schooling, whereas the father’s SEI is
unimportant at this level. This finding
might suggest that, given free schooling,
whether the grades are completed depends more on the value placed on education by the parents and the child’s
ability (both native and as a consequence of socialization in the home)
than on socioeconomic factors. However, the dilution of material resources
is represented by sibsize at this level of
schooling as 1s the corresponding ability
of parents to sustain the direct and indirect costs of early schooling. How much
the sibsize variable operates by influencing IQ and grades, and how much by influencing the direct and indirect costs of
maintaining offspring in school, cannot
be measured in these adult samples,
since data are not available on either JQ
or school performance. However, other
parts of our analysis have shown that,
among samples of youngsters, the effects of sibsize on IQ are substantial, especially among samples of very young
children (Blake, in press). Hence, one
can speculate that the early drop-out
rate among men from large families was
not due entirely to the diluting effect of
sibsize on material resources, but that it
was due as well to sibsize effects on IQ,
and the influence of the latter on school
performance. It should be noted also
that men whose fathers were farmers
(farm background in the equations) experienced some relatively important
negative effects at the graded-schooling
level. Thus, although in general the father’s occupational status was unimportant for graded schooling, having a father
who was a farmer was a disadvantage.
Once a boy graduates from high
school, Table 7 shows that college attendance and years in college depend

Siblings and Educational Attainment 19

more on the father’s SEI than on either
his education or sibsize. By the collegegoing level, there are a number of reasons why father’s SEI should move up in
relative importance. One reason is that
there has been a drastic selection of children from larger families reducing,
thereby, the relative importance of sibsize. Second, college involves not only
indirect costs (the student’s time and
consequent loss of earnings), but usually
substantial direct costs as well. It is
worth noting that, at this level, the effect
of farm background (although small)
moves from negative to positive, reflecting perhaps the availability of postsecondary opportunities at land-grant colleges.

CONCLUSION

Thave analyzed the effects of number
of siblings on total years of education,
years of graded schooling, proportions
graduating from high school, proportions of high school graduates going to
college, and years of college schooling.
Even after controlling for family background variables, I have found differences by sibsize in level of total education that rival simple bivariate
educational differences by race and age.
Those from large versus small families
lose about a year of graded schooling on
average, which translates into large differences in proportions graduating from
high school. Hence, although it seems
logical to think that the deleterious effect of large families centers on chances
for postsecondary education, the actual
fact is that the greatest effect is early in
people’s schooling—in the grades. Since
there are marked negative effects of increasing sibsize on IQ, it is highly probable that IQ, as well as the dilution of parents’ material and personal resources
 

 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

20 Blake

among many children, affects the dropout rates among those from large families.

Sibsize influences college attendance
much less than it influences graded
schooling. I believe that this finding

reflects the biases introduced by the |

marked selection out of large families at
the graded schooling level. Those children from large families who have made
it through high school are a sample of
survivors. They are quite probably
highly selected for IQ, motivation, performance, and whatever other factors
contribute to college attendance.

If sibsize is important as a predictor
of educational attainment, how does its
importance rank relative to that of other
predictors in the family background
model? For total years of education and
years of graded schooling, the father’s
education ranks first and sibsize second.
The father’s SEI ranks third for total
years, but it is unimportant for graded
schooling. By contrast, college schooling depends more on the father’s SE]

Social Biology

than on his education or on sibsize.
These results may be surprising for some
students of educational mobility, since
there has been a tendency to lump sibsize with the parents’ education and the
father’s occupation as “socioeconomic
background,” and to assume, thereby,
more importance for socioeconomic effects in the “macro” sense than seems
justified. It is one thing to look at socioeconomic effects controlling for sibsize,
and another to aggregate a major predictor like sibsize into the overall effects of
socioeconomic status.
