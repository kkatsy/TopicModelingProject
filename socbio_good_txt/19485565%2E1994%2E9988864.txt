socioeconomic caste groups.

The concept of genetic load was first
introduced by Muller (1950) as one of
the approaches to explain the relationship between inbreeding and some of
its presumed effects. Crow (1958) defined genetic load as the relative decrease in the average fitness of a population, with respect to the fitness it
would have if all individuals in the population had the genotype that has maximum fitness. Genetic load is a quantity designed to measure the loss of
A fitness of a population resulting from
selection against the deleterious homozygotes (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). The load resulting from
the loss of zygotes due to mutationselection balance and the load resulting
from overdominant loci are referred to
as mutational and segregational loads,
respectively. Only a few reports on the
genetic load among Andhra castes (Srikumari et al., 1985; Rao and Murty,
1990; Reddy, 1992) are available in the
literature.

ABSTRACT: The effect of inbreeding on mortality is assessed through genetic load estimates
among four caste populations, the Chakali, Kummari, Mangali, and Madiga of Andhra Pradesh,
India. The regression coefficient ““B” is positive and statistically not significant except in the
Mangali where reduced fetal wastage with increased inbreeding coefficient is noted. The B/A
values of the majority of populations suggest that the genetic load is mainly segregational. It is
suggested that among the Kummari, the load is predominantly mutational for prereproductive
mortality. Relatively higher values of intercept ‘‘A” are observed in the present study for low

In the present survey, we study the
effects of inbreeding on reproductive
wastage by estimating genetic load
among four endogamous caste populations of Andhra Pradesh, namely,
Chakali (washermen), Kummari (potters), Mangali (barbers), and Madiga
(cobblers). The former three groups
are classified as backward class communities in Andhra Pradesh while Madiga are a scheduled caste population.
All the families covered in the present
study belong to rural lower socioeconomic strata. The present paper is the
outcome of further analysis of demographic data published earlier by Babu
and Naidu (1989).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Estimates of genetic load were computed from the data on the reproductive histories of 405 couples belonging
to four castes, namely, Chakali, Kummari, Mangali, and Madiga, living in

rural Gokavaram mandal of East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, India.
The stillbirths and abortions were considered as prenatal loss while deaths up
to 15 years of age were recorded under
prereproductive mortality. The inbreeding effects in terms of genetic
load on fetal loss and prereproductive
mortality were estimated by an exponential regression model as illustrated
by Rao (1988).

where P; is the expected proportion of
survivors and F; is Wright’s coefficient
of inbreeding of the i" subgroup based
on the type of marriage. Coefficients
“A” and “B” were obtained by iterative computational methods. The chisquare tests were performed to test
the goodness of fit by considering the
values of “A” and “B.” The B/A ratio
explains the relative influence of mutational and segregational loci in maintaining genetic load. Usually the B/A
ratio will be = 10, if the load is predominantly mutational; and approximately 2 if the load is predominantly
segregational (Morton et al., 1956).

RESULTS

Estimates of genetic load among the
four Andhra caste populations are presented in Table 1. Three caste groups
exhibit a positive but nonsignificant regression coefficient “B” for prenatal
loss while the Mangali show a negative
(—0.1205) value. The results indicate
that fetal loss was reduced with an increased inbreeding coefficient among
the Mangali which is a deviation from
general observation. The B/A values
suggest that in most cases the load is
mainly segregational. The B/A ratios

are relatively lower for both prenatal
and prereproductive mortality among
the Chakali which clearly indicates that
the load is predominantly segregational. The B/A ratios based on prenatal loss among the Kummari and
Mangali also indicate a predominantly
sepregational load, but among the Madiga the load is mainly mutational. The
ratios based on prereproductive mortality indicate that the load is predominantly mutational among the Kummari, while the Mangali and Madiga
exhibit segregational load. When the
total mortality including prenatal
and prereproductive deaths is considered, only the Kummari exhibit a
higher B/A value suggesting mutational load. Consistency of segregational load based on both prenatal and
prereproductive mortality is observed
among the Mangalt. The lethal equivalents per gamete lie between “‘B” and
“B+A.” The lower and upper limits of
lethal equivalents per gamete among
present castes range between 0.1 and
3.2 and average around 0.17 and 0.68
respectively. The intercept ‘‘A”’ measures the mortality of the noninbred
fraction, which is supposed to be an
index of public health condition. The
present caste populations record relatively higher values of “A” which is
consistent with their low socioeconomic status and poor public health
conditions.

A review of literature on the genetic
load among Andhra castes reveals negative and nonsignificant ““B’’ values
among fishermen castes, the Vadde,
Vadabalija, and Jalari (Reddy, 1992),
for prenatal loss similar to the observation made in the present study of the
Mangali caste. The B/A values suggest
a segregational load in the majority of

Andhra castes including the present
study populations.

Although various studies are available on inbreeding effects, it is difficult
to explain the effect of inbreeding
on mortality. It may be that high rates
of inbreeding do not always elevate

the level of reproductive wastage as
expected in populations, especially
among contemporary Andhra populations, due to the elimination of deleterious genes through prolonged
consanguinity with very high rates of
inbreeding over several generations.
