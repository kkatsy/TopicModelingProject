Physique and Family Variables
in University Girls in Britain

ABSTRACT: In a large sample of girls admitted to the University of Warwick, 1971-81, physique, as measured by height, weight, and ponderal index, was examined in relation to family
variables and socioeconomic class. Not only do girls of different social classes enter the university at different average ages, but also the family size from which they come varies. There are
differences between social classes in mean height, and the secular trend to increasing height

continues.

Chamla (1983), drawing together
data on secular trends 1960-80 in height
in young adults in Western European
countries, was unable to find any relevant material covering this period from
Britain where, although there have been
several growth studies of children since
the war (e.g., Douglas, 1964; Dougias et
al., 1965; Miller et al., 1972), there is
relatively little information on diachronic variation in body size and shape
in the older age groups. A previous
twelve-year study of Swansea University students (Roberts and Dann, 1975;
Dann and Roberts, 1976) indicated a
tendency to increasing height and linearity, partly due to changes in the regional derivation of the students in the
sample. It appeared of interest to report
a further series of cross-sectional studies
among university students, which investigated whether secular trends in body
size and shape are still continuing and
whether socioeconomic differences in
physique persist, and how they are related to other factors in the family environment.

MATERIALS AND METHOD

The subjects were 3,496 girls, admitted to the University of Warwick during
the eleven-year period 1971-81. They
were all born between 1946 and 1964,
the majority between 1953 and 1964,
and at admission they were between the
ages of 17 and 28, with the great majority between 18 and 20. The sample included no girls born outside Britain, and
no girls were colored. All were measured in their first six months of residence by the same observer, using the
same instruments and giving the same
instructions to each, e.g., for stature to
stand as upright as possible and to look
horizontally before her. Final adjustment of the head into the Frankfurt
plane was completed by touch. Thus,
the variation included no inter-observer
or inter-instrument error, and there is
no reason to suppose any consistent
trend in intra-observer or posing error
over the years in which the work was undertaken. All measuring was done between 1000 and 1600 hours, and the

same numbers of girls were measured
each morning and afternoon session at
the end as at the beginning of the survey;
diurnal variation may therefore contribute slightly to the variance in stature,
but no consistent trend is likely.

The following independent variables
were considered for each girl:

A, Year of birth less 1945;

X Family size as measured by number of siblings;

X 3 Her numerical position in the sibship;

X4The father’s occupation described numerically, as in the
Registrar-General’s classification.

The following dependent variables were
considered separately:

Y, Height in centimeters, measured
to the nearest centimetre, which
ranged from 137 to 184;

Y, Weight, measured in kilograms, which ranged from 34
to 108;

Y3 The ponderal index, measured as
stature over the cube root of
weight which gives a measure of
the linearity of physique and
which ranged from 10.62 for the

Social Biology

plumpest to 15.14 for the most
slender.

These variables were examined by
analysis of variance and multiple regression techniques.

RESULTS

The means and standard deviations
for each variable by social class (X4) are
given in Table 1. Analysis of variance
shows that the classes differ highly significantly in each of the social variables. It
seems that girls of Social Class I enter
the university at an average age older by
ten months than those of Social Class I,
by one year and 11 months than those of
Social Class HI and IV, but only by 11
months than those of Social Class V.
This may be due to secular trends in the
sample, with enrollment of an increasing proportion of girls from Classes ITI
and IV. Girls of Social Class V tend to
come from larger families than do the
remainder, and their position in the
family is also later. However, girls of Social Class I also come from slightly larger
families than those of Classes II, II, and
IV. As regards physique, there are again
highly significant differences between
classes in mean height, with the girls of
Social Classes I and II being slightly

taller, but there are no significant differences in weight. The difference observed in ponderal index therefore, with
girls of Classes I, II, and HI being
slightly more linear in average physique
than those in Classes IV and V, is to be
expected.

secular trend. There is, however, a
slight suggestion of increase in mean
height from year to year, while variation
in weight from year to year is significant
(p = 0.028) with the suggestion of a tendency to increase in weight.

Of the zero-order correlation coefficients between the independent and
dependent variables (Table 3), those of
stature with year of birth and with social
class are significant, the latter highly so.
The ponderal index shows a highly signi

ficant negative correlation with social
class, but with no other variable. On account of these intercorrelations, a multiple regression analysis was undertaken
of each dependent variable on the four
independent (Table 4). Stature shows a
significantly increasing secular trend
and an increase with social class, while
there is also a somewhat disturbing
significant diminution with the number
of sibs. This social class effect on height
is independent of the secular trend. The
ponderal index shows a tendency to increased linearity in the upper social
classes. Of the variables in the weight regression, only position in family exerts
an effect that is barely significant. Of the
three overall regressions, only two (stature and ponderal index) are significant
(F = 8.22, p < 0.0001; F = 4.66, p <
0.001, respectively), but the low multiple correlation coefficients indicate how
slight is the proportion of total variance
in the physique variables to be attributed to the socioeconomic variables,
barely 1 per cent in height, 0.50 per cent
in ponderal index, and 0.25 per cent in
weight.

Since it may not be valid to treat the
socioeconomic classification as a numerical variable, the interrelationships were

Social Biology

examined within social classes by covariance analysis. The regression coefficients within social class and their
standard errors are given in Table 5.
They differ little from those in Table 4,
though for all three variables there is a
very slight increase in the multiple correlation coefficients. The results as expected are very similar to those of the initial analysis of variance. Though small,
the effect of social class on physique,
primarily through the effect on stature,
appears well established.

The occurrence of regional variations
in physique in Britain has been recognized for more than a century, and the
differences pointed out by Beddoe in
1870 remained in the 1940’s, with gradients of increasing stature and weight as
one moved south and east across the
United Kingdom (Roberts, 1953). In
the years covered by the present survey,
the University of Warwick was expanding, and it is possible that such expansion might have brought a change in
composition of the sample. Examination of the students by region of origin
shows indeed highly significant differences in stature. Considering only regions where the numbers are sufficiently
large, we find the smallest statures occur

cial Class 5 is very obvious. Thirdly, in
the physique variables, though the
results are very similar, with a clear class
gradient in height but not in weight, giving the different average morphologies,
the Warwick girls are consistently taller
than the Swansea girls, the mean difference increasing in the lower socioeconomic groups. The mean weight is
slightly lower in Classes 1, 2, and 4, but
rather greater in Class 5, and the result is
a slightly more linear physique in all five
classes in Warwick. The associations of
stature with year of birth and social class
are about the same in Warwick as in
Swansea, as shown by the zero-order
correlations, but those of ponderal index are less close. The effects of the social variables on height, as shown by the
regression coefficients, are consistently
greater in Warwick, by a factor of 4 for
birth year and a factor of 2 for the remainder. The secular change in weight
has disappeared, and the effect of social
class on ponderal index has increased.
There has been a slight decrease in the
multiple correlation coefficients in all
three variables.

INTERPRETATION

The obvious differences in height
among the socioeconomic classes attracted social investigators in Europe in
the nineteenth century, such as Villerme
in France and Chadwick in England, to
use stature to trace changes in economic
and social conditions. Tanner (1955,
1966, 1982) has repeatedly drawn attention to the usefulness of growth data for
monitoring social and economic environments and, recognizing this, the National Bureau of Economic Research in
America recently sponsored an examination of economic and social trends as
indicated by secular change in height. It

Social Biology

established that the changing pattern of
height of American whites, and its relationship to socioeconomic differences,
is substantially different from that in
most European populations (Fogel et
al., 1982). The historical data that are
available show that the secular trend in
height, while generally positive, has at
times been negative.

One interpretation, then, of the general trend toward earlier menarcheal
age that occurred in Britain until about
twenty years ago, and toward greater
stature at.a given age, was that these
were a reflection of improvement in environmental conditions. The cessation
of the downward menarcheal age trend
(Roberts and Dann, 1975) and its apparent replacement by an upward movement in the subjects here analyzed
(Dann and Roberts, 1984) could be seen
as possibly indicating deterioration in
those environmental factors that affect
growth and development in Britain. The
present finding of a secular trend toward
increasing stature provides some reassurance. Yet this perhaps is not as solidly based as it may at first seem. Factors
to consider are that the present sample
relates to a selected and possibly privileged section of the population which
may not be representative of the whole.
Whether or not differences in height observed between social classes in this
study are due to environmental or genetic differences, the diminution in stature within families with increase in number of sibs is not likely to be genetic. It
parallels the tendency toward later menarcheal age with sibship size, and it is noticeable that the regression coefficient of
height on position in family is negative
only in Social Class 5 in this study. This
suggests that in some sections of the
community their situation as regards the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

factors that affect growth and maturation may still be quite marginal.
Whatever the cause, the present
study reveals an interesting discrepancy
in that social class differences apparently continue to occur in stature but not
in menarcheal age. The results are in
agreement with other recent reports. No
class differences in menarcheal age were
found in two studies in northern England, respectively, in a depressed industrialized and a middle-class residential urban area (Roberts, et al., 1971;
Roberts, et al., 1975). As regards physique, however, Billewicz et al. (1983)
showed that in Newcastle upon Tyne
adolescents at age 15 both boys’ and
girls’ height, and particularly leg length,
tended to diminish with father’s occupational status and with family size. Smith
et al., (1980) showed that differences of
attained height by social (occupational)
class and family size persisting in S- to
10-year-old children, are already well
established by age 5 years; in boys also,
skinfold thicknesses and arm circumference diminished with family size. In
other countries the situation varies.
There is generally an inverse relationship between social class and obesity in
adults in the United States and Western
European countries (Baird, Silverstone,
et al., 1974; Oken et al., 1977; Ravelli
and Belmont, 1979) and sometimes in
children (Stonkard et al., 1972; White
Physique and Family Variables 51

law, 1971; Wilkinson et al., 1977), but
Others have not observed this relationship (Rona and Chinn, 1982; Garn et
al., 1975). Differences in height between socioeconomic groups in Oslo
schoolchildren seem to have disappeared (Brundtland, 1980). It seems
that in the United Kingdom, while the
environmental, and particularly general
care and nutritional, differences that
distinguished the socioeconomic classes
and possibly influenced menarcheal age
have today disappeared, those affecting
stature have not. Rona et al (1978)
noted that in primary schoolchildren biological factors (parental height and
birth weight in particular) contributed
much more to the variance of height
than did social factors (social class, family size, and employment status) and so
did Billewicz’s material. This suggests
that genetic differences between classes
affecting stature remain. This is not to
imply that all environmental restriction
on growth has been removed; instead, it
is to be sought between families within
classes, rather than between classes.
