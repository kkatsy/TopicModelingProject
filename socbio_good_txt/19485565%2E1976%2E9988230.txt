Childlessness, Health, and
Marital Satisfaction

ABSTRACT: Data on the health and well-being of 2,480 married couples in an urban areaprobability sample suggest that parenthood detracts from the physical and psychological health of
husbands and wives, particularly among younger couples. Rates of joint marital satisfaction also
were lower for active parents than for former parents and childless couples, regardless of the
duration of the marriage and the wife’s age and employment status. That parenthood may be
detrimental to both health and marital satisfaction is suggested by the finding that former parents
were better off than active parents on both indices, though not as well off as childless spouses.

Back in 1947, data from the 1941 Indianapolis fertility study were published
showing that childless couples were happier with their marriages than couples
raising children (Reed, 1947). Since then,
no one has investigated this relationship
with a sample even as representative as
the one used for the Indianapolis study.
The absence of research in this area doubtless reflects American values for, until
recently at least, we have considered
childlessness a misfortune, not a way of
life any married couples would choose
voluntarily.

Most of the large-scale fertility studies
conducted in the past thirty years show
that very few Americans will say that they
prefer to remain childless; few even go so
far as to indicate a preference for only one
child. Nevertheless, childless marriage is
now a fashionable topic, due no doubt to
the combined effects of the women’s liberation movement, anxiety about overpopulation, and the high cost of rearing
children. Ellen Peck’s The Baby Trap
(1972) reached a large audience, and childless marriage has been advocated with enthusiasm by journalists (e.g., Rollin, 1970)

and popular psychologists (Silverman and
Silverman, 1971). Even McCall’s magazine, a stronghold of traditional femininity, recently printed a sympathetic account
of the activities of the National Organization for Non-Parents (Lester, 1974).

Scholarly attention to childless marriage
has largely been confined to its incidence
(still low) and to its demographic correlates (e.g., Whelpton et al., 1966; Kiser et
al., 1968), although the previous tendency
to treat childlessness stricly as a manifestation of sterility has been replaced by attention to “voluntary” childlessness (Gustavus and Henley, 1971; Veevers, 1971),
1973; Rao, 1974). But sociologists have
rarely discussed, much less investigated,
childlessness as a factor in marital satisfaction, despite Peck’s argument to the effect that mothers make unsatisfactory
wives and Rossi’s influential “Transition
to Parenthood” (1968) which explored the
many negative consequences motherhood
has for the health and well-being of women.

The possibility that the first child
creates a difficult situation (“trauma”) for
its parents has been explored, inconclu

sively, in a series of small nonrepresentative samples (results summarized by
Jacoby, 1969). Dissatisfaction with the
spouse and with the marriage increased
after the birth of the first child in two
independent panel samples drawn from
predominantly white, middle-class, urban
populations (Feldman, 1971; Ryder,
1973). But the relation between marital
satisfaction and parental status has evidently not been investigated in a large representative sample since the 1941 Indianapolis study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data I shall present here were taken
from a large area-probability sample of
households in Alameda County, California, in 1965. These data were collected by
the Human Population Laboratory of the
California State Department of Public
Health, whose publications (California
Department of Public Health, 1966, and
Hochstim and Athanasopoulos, 1970) describe the sampling procedure and the
sample in detail. Generalization from this
sample to other American metropolitan
areas is legitimate; for even though
Alameda County may be distinctive with
respect to population characteristics such
as ethnicity, age, and occupation, there is
no evidence that within this population
relationships involving the major variables presented here are markedly different from those in similar populations
elsewhere.

In an earlier publication from this study
(Renne, 1970), I reported in passing that
married persons in this sample who had
never had children were happier with
their marriages than those who had had
children—regardless of race, family income, or duration of marriage. Since then
I have discovered that childless couples
not only were happier, but those in the
younger age groups were healthier as well,

which suggests that factors other than
physical malfunctioning may be contributing to childlessness among urban couples.

The present paper is confined to the
2,480 couples in the sample, that is, to
those who were married, living with
spouse, and whose spouse also returned a
questionnaire. The total sample, based on
4,452 households, consisted of 6,928
adults—persons age 20 or older, or ages
16-19 and ever married—who completed
a 23-page mail questionnaire concerned
primarily with health. For most of the
couples there was sufficient information to
distinguish childless couples (14 per cent),
those rearing children (61 per cent), and
those who had had children but were no
longer active parents (25 per cent). These
three categories comprise the variable
“parental status.”

Parental status as defined here is
primarily a social rather than a biological
variable; and it refers to couples, not to
individuals. Couples who were living with
children classified as their own were considered “active parents”’—regardless of
whether both spouses, or neither one,
were the biological parents—as were individuals who had never had children of
their own but were living with the spouse’s
offspring.

The definition does incorporate a biological element in distinguishing between
“childless couples,” where neither spouse
had ever had children, and “former parents,” where at least one spouse dad in the
past had children. Most of the former parents, of course, were couples whose biological offspring had become adults or had
left home; but a divorced and remarried
man, for example, whose children had
remained with their mother, was classified
along with his wife as a former parent
unless his household included his current
wife’s children, in which case both spouses
were Classified as active parents.

It should be emphasized that the

Alameda County survey was not intended
as a study of family characteristics except
insofar as they were related to health. Its
overall purpose was to investigate the relation between health and “way of life” as
represented by a number of social and
demographic variables. Race, marital
status, income, and occupation were emphasized more than family size, which was
used principally to evaluate income adequacy; and the questionnaire did not cover
spacing of children, use of birth control,
attitudes toward family size, or other
characteristics that might account directly
for the presence or absence of children.

a third of the wives were under age 25,
compared with about one in ten of the
wives raising children. Former parents, of
course, were older—88 per cent of these
wives were over age 45, compared with 19
per cent of the active mothers. Table 1
(extreme left-hand column) gives the
wives’ age distribution in each of the three
parental-status groups.

Childless couples were also likely to
have married recently, as Table 1 shows;
but in the older age groups this difference
was not a large one. Among childless
couples with wives aged 45-64, 87 per
cent had been married at least ten
years—not much less than the 92 per cent
of active parents in the same age group
who had been married that long.

Thus, childlessness was not confined to
recent marriages or to a particular age
group. It was naturally more common
among recent marriages; but when the
wife was over age 45, couples married re

cently were no more likely to be childless
than those married longer. In this older
age group, the rate of childlessness was
higher for those married 3-19 years than
for those married 20 years or longer. This
finding reflects a positive relation between
childlessness and age at marriage, also reported by Veevers (1971b, 1972a) for
ever-married women age 45 and over in
Canada in 1961 and by Mitra (1966) for
American women in 1960.

Among couples married at least three
years, childlessness occurred more frequently when the wife was over 45 than
when the wife was 25-44 (Table 2). Rao

not confined to the recently-married and
indeed may have been increasing among
young couples. Comparison between the
age-group totals in Table 2 and rates of
childlessness reported for American wives
generally (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1974, Table 50) indicates that in 1965
childlessness was more common _ in
Alameda County than in the country as a
whole among wives under 25, but not
among older wives. Alameda County’s
rate for wives under 25 was also higher
than Rao (1974) reported for comparable
age groups in his Rhode Island sample.
These comparisons suggest that young

(1974) and Veevers (1971a) note a decline
in childlessness since the 1940’s in Rhode
Island and the United States respectively,
noting that voluntary childlessness was
more prevalent during the 1930’s (when
women over 45 in 1965 were entering their
reproductive years) than in the “babyboom” period of the 1950’s when women
25—44 in 1965 were entering their reproductive years.

Both Rao and Veevers assume that
childlessness will continue to decline, and
they attribute the high rates among
women under 25 to a delay in first births.
Our data show, however, that among
those married at least three years,
childlessness is, if anything, more common
for wives under 25 than for wives 25-44.
In other words, by 1965, childlessness was

couples in the comparatively  welleducated, disproportionately white-collar
population of Alameda County may have
been a “vanguard” in the movement to
delay, limit, or avoid parenthood that has
since become more fashionable.

Race and religion.—The traditional
ideological differences between Catholics
and Protestants might lead one to expect
higher rates of childlessness among Protestants, as Rao (1974) found in Rhode Island; but in Alameda County this higher
rate for Protestants occurred only among
foreign-born white (including Mexican)
wives under 65. (Catholics are a minority
in Alameda County and represent different ethnic groups than they do in Rhode
Island where they are a majority.) Among
native-born white wives there was vir

tually no difference between Catholics and
Protestants, although wives aged 25-44
who claimed no religious affiliation were
about three times as likely as Catholics to
have remained childless.

Black wives under age 25 were only
about half as likely as native white wives
under age 25 to be childless (19 per cent
vs. 41 per cent); but among wives aged
25-44 Blacks did not differ from whites,
and among those over age 45, Black wives
were twice as likely as white wives to be
childless (25 per cent vs. 12 per cent). A
similar age difference also occurred among
Catholic wives, which suggests that physiological factors may have contributed to
childlessness among older couples of lower
socioeconomic status. In this regard, Veevers (1971a) suggests that the rapid decline
of childlessness among nonwhite women
since 1940 may have been due partly to
“improvements in the control of venereal
disease.”

Higher rates of childlessness among
older couples generally, white as well as
Black, were not due to the higher rates of
divorce or widowhood and remarriage in
these groups, for the rate of childlessness
among remarried couples was lower than
among couples in first marriages of the
same duration.

Husband’s occupation.—Among younger
white couples, childlessness occurred most
frequently at the highest occupational
level. About half the couples in which the
wife was under 25 and the husband was in
a high-level white-collar job were childless, compared with about a quarter of
those in which the husband was a factory
or service worker or unskilled laborer.
Among older white couples, husband’s occupation was not consistently associated
with the rate of childlessness.

Wife’s education and employment.—
One might expect to find that a relatively
high proportion of college-educated wives
had avoided motherhood, but our data did

Childlessness and Marital Satisfaction

187

not consistently support this expectation.
Table 3 shows that among younger wives,
the college-educated were more likely to be
childless, but that among women age 45
and older education had no such effect.
Rao (1974) reported a similar pattern for
the women in his Rhode Island sample.
This finding suggests that female college
graduates born after 1920 were more likely
than those born earlier to remain childless. The comparisons between childless
couples and active parents in Table 3 indicate a possible generational effect, since
they show that childless wives under age
45 were more highly educated than active
mothers, while among older wives active
mothers were more highly educated. To be
certain that this finding reflects a declining
interest in motherhood among collegeeducated wives, we would, of course,
have to know what proportion of the
women aged 25-44 in 1965 were still childless 5 to 25 years later.

An inverse relation between women’s
labor-force participation and their fertility
has been well established in previous research (e.g., Sweet, 1973, Chapter 3); but
no research has yet established whether
women unable to have children are more
likely to work outside the home or whether
they limit their fertility in order to work.
At present, our data cannot be used to
answer this question either, but the
follow-up study conducted in 1974 will
presumably shed some light on the question. As of 1965, working wives in our
sample, like those in other samples, were
more likely to be childless, although working mothers were as likely as housewives
to have several children.

With respect to childlessness, as opposed to fertility, we found that wives
working full time were much more likely
than housewives to be childless—or, conversely, that childless wives were much
more likely to be working full time (Table
4). A substantial minority of childless

wives were vot in the labor force, however, and the proportion working port
time was about the same for active
mothers as for childless wives. Among
wives under 45, housewives with full-time
work experience were less likely to be
childless than other housewives, indicating that motherhood may have induced
women in the former category to leave the
Jabor market.

What kind of job the wife had was evidently less important than whether she
worked or not. Among working wives
aged 25-44, professional and technical
workers did have a higher rate of
childlessness (25 per cent) than any other
group, but among working wives aged
45-64 the rate of childlessness was about
20 per cent regardless of occupation.

In summary, childless couples were

~

likely to be young, although more than a
third were over 45, and married relatively
recently, although almost two-fifths had
been married more than ten years. A majority of childless wives under age 45 had
attended college, compared with less than
a third of active mothers under 45; and
about half of those under 65 were working
full time, compared with about a fourth of
active mothers. Neither the husband’s occupation nor the wife’s was related consistently to the couple’s parental status, although in the younger age groups childless
spouses were somewhat more likely than
active parents to be in the higher-status
white-collar occupations.

assumption being that any “normal”
woman would have at least one child if she
could.! Even in 1965, this attitude was
prevalent enough to warrant the assumption that some large proportion of the
childless couples in the Alameda County

' For survey evidence on this point, see Rainwater
(1965, Chapters 4-5) or Whelpton et al. (1966, Chapter 4). In a population chosen for its unusually high
fertility and heavily pronatal attitudes, Eaton and

Mayer (1954, p. 20) found only 10 women (3 per cent)
who had never had children among the 340 women
over age 45. This finding suggests that the 10 per cent
sterility rate usually cited for American couples (e.g.,
Freedman et al., 1959, p. 18; Whelpton et al., 1966,
Chapter 4) may overestimate the amount of
physiologically-based childlessness in the population.
Rao (1974, p. 156) found only 22 women (4 per cent)
who said that it was not physically possible for them
to have children among 555 wives ages 30-49, and an
equal number were evidently childless by choice.
Similarly, Veevers (1972b) estimated that no more
than 50 per cent of childless couples in Canada in
1961, or about 5 per cent of married women, were
physiologically unable to have children.

population were childless for reasons
beyond their control, particularly in the
older age groups, although we have no
data with which to check this assumption.
If childlessness in this population were a
function of physiological impairment,
however, one would expect to find that
childless couples reported more physical
health problems than those who had had
children.

On the contrary, Table 5 shows that
childless wives and husbands were less
likely than active parents to report physical disabilities, impairments, chronic
illnesses, or other physical symptoms.?
These differences are small, but they occurred in every age group under 65. The
small differences in the 45-64 age group
and the reversal after age 65—and particularly the large proportions of childless
husbands and wives in the over-65 group
who reported two or more chronic illnesses
or a disability—do suggest that childlessness was associated with poor health in the
past.

Among older people then (in this sample, those older than the median age of 45
years), most childlessness was probably
not voluntary, but due primarily to
physiological impairment. Although we
have no direct evidence that childlessness
was more likely to be voluntary among
younger couples than among older
couples, it seems more reasonable to infer
that it was voluntary than to conclude that
sterility was more common among
younger persons without other health
problems than it was when the older wives
were of childbearing age.

Respondents were asked for a subjective
appraisal of their health as well as for
specific illnesses and symptoms. Their an

swers were categorized as shown in Table
6. Again, childless spouses in the younger
age groups were healthier, especially
wives. Forty-three per cent of childless
wives under 25 described their health as
excellent or better than that of others the
same age, compared with 24 per cent of
active mothers under 25; for husbands in
this group, the percentages were 56 per
cent and 41 per cent. The association between parenthood and poor health, or at
least low morale, is evidently stronger for
mothers than for fathers.

In each of the three older age groups,
however, the difference between childless
spouses and active or former parents is
successively smaller, and among women
over 45, mothers were more likely than
childless wives to describe their health as
excellent. Again, this finding suggests that
childlessness on the part of women born
before 1920 was not voluntary and may
have been a consequence of poor health.
On the other hand, the reversal after age
65 may also reflect the fact that none of the
parents in this group were actually raising
children.

For women under 45, the association
between health and childlessness may
reflect a causal process in the opposite direction, that is, it suggests that parenthood
may have had a deleterious effect on
health or at least on the individual’s
evaluation of his or her health. Mothers
under age 25, for instance, were almost
twice as likely as childless wives to describe their health as fair or poor, or worse
than that of others the same age.

The parental-status difference for both
spouses was larger for the subjective
health measure than for the more objective measure based on questions about
specific symptoms and illnesses. Lacking
any direct evidence on the actual
physiological effect of parenthood on
health, we may infer that to some large
extent these responses represent differ

ences in morale rather than health. Husbands’ and wives’ responses to eight questions about emotional or “feeling” states
(e.g., how often they felt “very lonely or
remote from other people,” “bored,” “on
top of the world,” etc.) support this inference. In all four age groups, childless
wives and husbands were more likely than
active parents to display a relatively high
level of psychological well-being, and
those under 45 were also less likely to display an absence of well-being.*

PARENTAL STATUS AND MARITAL HAPPINESS

Knowing that childless couples tended
to enjoy better health and higher morale,
we should not be surprised to find that
they were happier with their marriages,
and indeed they were. Responses from
both spouses to six questions about their
marriages were scored in such a way as to
yield three groups: the “unhappily married,” who expressed serious dissatisfaction; the “happily married,” who expressed no dissatisfaction at all or had only
minor complaints; and an intermediate
group who could be classified as neither
happily nor unhappily married. For
example, a wife who said she had seriously
considered divorce or separation recently
would be classified as unhappily married,
no matter how she answered the other five
questions, while a wife who said she sometimes regretted her marriage would be
classified in the intermediate group unless
she also expressed more serious dissatisfaction in responding to other questions.
All respondents in the “happily married”
group described their marriages as happy
“all in all” and said they had never regretted their marriages.4

In a comparison of active parents with
childless couples, as couples, the largest

correlates, see Berkman (1971).

“This index and its correlates are described in
detail in Renne (1970).

Childlessness and Marital Satisfaction 193

difference is in the proportions of both
spouses who were happily married.
Forty-five per cent of the childless couples
agreed in assessing their marriage as
happy, compared with only 24 per cent of
active parents; and both spouses expressed
serious dissatisfaction in 13 per cent of the
active-parent marriages, compared with 6
per cent of childless marriages. Number of
children made less difference in the percentage happily married than simple parental status, a finding also reported by
Reed (1947).

Controlling for wife’s age does not affect
this relationship, although the difference
between childless couples and active parents was smallest in the 45-64 age group.
Duration of marriage does affect the relationship, however, as Table 7 shows.
Among couples married 10-19 years,
childless couples were only slightly more
likely than active parents to be happy with
their marriages; rates of joint happiness
were low in this time period for all
couples, and rates of joint unhappiness
were high.

Low rates of marital happiness (or satisfaction) have been associated in other
studies not with the duration of marriage
but with the presence of school-age children (see Rollins and Feldman, 1970, fora
summary of several of these studies). But
our finding that even childless marriages
of 10-19 years duration were less satisfactory than others suggests that it is not the
couple’s “life-cycle” stage (i.e., children’s
ages) but rather the duration of marriage
itself that is associated with satisfaction.
(Rollins and Feldman (1970) excluded
childless couples from their own study on
the grounds that they were “atypical.”)

For durations shorter than ten years or
longer than twenty, however, childless
couples retained a clear advantage over
active parents and former parents alike.
Differences were largest in early marriages

(one to two years) and long-term marriages
(thirty years or more). In both periods,
over half the childless couples reported no
more than minor complaints from either
spouse, while only about one-third of active parents married one to two years and
one-eighth of those married over thirty
years were as happy.

Long-term childless marriages were
probably “selected” by the process that has
in the past produced a relatively high divorce rate among childless couples in the
early stages of marriage (U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare,
1963, pp. 24-34). But the difference between childless couples and active parents
in the first two years of marriage cannot as
easily be explained by selection. Instead,
the most obvious explanation is that children reduce marital satisfaction, just as
they seem to have a negative effect on the
physical health and psychological wellbeing of parents in the younger age
groups. In the later stages of marriage,
also, the difference between former parents and those still involved in childrearing is striking. Former parents married
thirty years or more were three times as
likely to be happily married as active parents, although they were less positive

about their marriages than couples who
had never had children.

The implication, of course, is that children impose a strain on marriage. Put another way, the assumption of parental
roles interferes with or takes precedence
over the dyadic relationship established
prior to the birth of the first child, an
interpretation also suggested by Feldman
(1971) and Ryder (1973) on the basis of
their interviews with couples before and
after the birth of the first child.

Another less obvious implication is that
childless marriages may be more equalitarian, since it is these marriages that most
often include a working wife or, in the
younger age groups, a college-educated
wife. The question then arises as to
whether it is the presumably equalitarian
nature of such marriages or the absence of
children that contributes to higher rates of
satisfaction among childless couples.
Table 8 offers evidence relevant to this
question.

Unfortunately for the assumption that
equalitarian marriages are happier, Table
8 shows that joint satisfaction was reported Jess frequently when the wife was
gainfully employed than when she was
not. Regardless of duration, the happiest

marriages appear to have been those in
which the wife was neither gainfully employed nor a mother, while those in which
the wife was a working mother were least
likely to have been satisfactory to both
spouses. (A more refined measure of the
wife’s status, taking into account education, occupational level, and work experience, indicated that these distinctions had
much less effect on joint happiness than
the simple working-wife vs. housewife distinction.)

Table 8 does show that whether the wife
was gainfully employed or not, childless
couples were more likely to be happily
married. This difference appeared consistently when the wife’s education and occupational status were also taken into account, and in general it was as large a
difference for housewives as for working
wives. Moreover, differences in joint satisfaction between parents and childless
couples tended to be larger than the difference between housewives and working
wives. Evidently gainful employment on
the part of the wife detracted from marital
satisfaction, but to a lesser extent than
motherhood.

SUMMARY

Data on the health and well-being of
couples in this large urban sample suggest

Renne

Social Biology

that parenthood detracts from the health
and morale of husbands and wives, particularly among younger couples. This
phenomenon is probably social rather than
biological, since former parents show less
evidence of strain than active parents.

Childless marriages were more likely to
be happy ones, even among the older
couples for whom childlessness was associated with poor health; and the childless marriages tended to improve with
time, while parents’ marriages tended to
deteriorate. Rates of joint marital happiness on the part of active parents showed a
fairly steady decline as the length of marriage increased; for childless couples, in
contrast, rates of joint satisfaction declined over the first four time periods and
increased during the last two periods
(Table 7). The follow-up data collected
from this sample in 1973-74 will yield more
conclusive evidence on this point, but
even these cross-sectional data offer strong
support for the argument that childless
marriages are happier, regardless of the
duration of the marriage or the age of the
couple.
