Graying of the Hair and Mortality

In a study of hypotheses about aging,
Damon and Roen (1973) use grayness of
hair as an indicator of rate of aging. Grayness of hair is, of course, positively correlated with age (0.54 to 0.76 in 15 Series
studied by Damon and Roen). In testing
the correlation of pulse rate with grayness,
Damon and Roen found inconsistent results among various series studied. When
age was held constant in one of their studies of 440 healthy white males, the positive
correlation coefficient of pulse rate and
grayness was statistically significant.

If age is held constant, does graying of
hair remain a significant criterion of aging
in other respects such as mortality? Ii
the hypothesis that grayness of hair is
symptomatic of aging even when chronological age is held constant, then one might
expect positive correlations between grayness of head hair and likelihood of death
from natural causes in a fixed period of
subsequent years. The observation that
men tend to gray earlier than women
would also be consistent with the hypothesis,! since age-specific death rates are lower
in women than in men at all ages.

A follow-up study of mortality in a

Solomon Islanders, but not for Caucasians, according to studies cited by Damon and Roen.

 

population in which grayness of head hair
had been observed and recorded 21 years
previously presents an opportunity to test
this question.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In 1948, we interviewed and examined
480 adult Mexicans in Paracho, Michoacan, and scored each as to occurrence of
gray hair: O for none, 1 for slight, 2 for
moderate, and 3 for general. The category “slight” included individuals with
only one or a few gray hairs; “moderate”
indicated individuals with some parts of
the scalp showing a scattering of gray
hairs among predominantly pigmented
hairs; and “general” referred to individuals with numerous gray hairs in all parts
of the scalp.

In 1969 the death registers for all the
intervening years were examined; 75 of
the men and 26 of the women had died
(98 were listed; informants told us of the
deaths of three others). Ages were recorded during interviews in 1948 and later
checked with the death records.

Since few individuals under age 35
showed any gray hairs and there were no
cases of precocious graying in our series,
the analysis was confined to individuals
aged 35 or older. The few individuals aged

290

Vol. 21, No. 3

70 or older in 1948 were not included in
the analyses of mortality, since virtually
all had died by 1969.

Comparisons of differences between the
sexes was on the basis of ¢-score analysis
of the differences of scores of the individuals of either sex from the mean for
their respective five-year age group. Mean
scores for each five-year age group of each
sex were then separately calculated, and
differences between those known to have
died of natural causes and all others were

evaluated by t-score analysis of differences
between the means of these age-sex adjusted scores. A comparison between those
who reported their parents to be “Jndigenes” (Indian) and those who considered their parents to be “Mestizos” (Indian
and Spanish) or other was made in the
same way.

whether the individual was known to have
died a nonviolent death between 1948 and
1969. Seven men who had met violent
deaths and 3 women who died in accidents
or childbirth are omitted from the table
because no relation between hair graying
and such events could be anticipated.

The men have a higher average grayness score than the women. The difference
is not statistically significant. However,
since it agrees with data on other populations, sex as well as age are shown separately in Table 1 and allowed for in the
rest of the analyses. As shown in Table 1,
age groups 35-39, 45-49, 50-54, and
60-64 among males and 40-44 and 55-59
among females show a tendency toward
more graying in those individuals since
reported to have died than in the remainder,

Age groups 35-49 combined show a
positive association of no graying (0) and
likelihood of having survived (chi-square
with Yates correction, 4.37 in males, 8.86
in females). Individuals of each sex aged
50-69 show a tendency in the same direction if separated into no (0) and slight (1)
gray hair versus moderate (2) and general
(3) graying, but the data yield low nonsignificant chi-squares.

Since the correlation with age within
such wide age groups may account for at
least some of the positive association, age
was discounted by comparing each grayness score with the mean of its own fiveyear age group of the same sex. The 55
individuals of these ages known to have
died nonviolent deaths average 0.25 units
of graying above their age-sex means, and
the 183 not known to have died average
0.08 units below. The difference (0.33
units) yields a ¢-score of 2.16 and is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

DISCUSSION

If there is a universal tendency for mortality risks to be positively associated with

 

Social Biology

grayness of head hair, it might have considerable practical importance through use
of head-hair color as an indicator of the
presence of conditions (general aging or
specific disease processes) responsible for
the association. It is therefore important
to examine the factors which might bias
the present analysis. These are: (1) possible dyeing of the hair by some individuals; (2) correlation of hair grayness with
age within the age intervals; (3) use of the
unsupportable assumption of normal distribution of grayness in the statistical
scores analysis; (4) possible association of
a genetic tendency to earlier grayness in
the same subgroup of the population as
has the higher mortality rates; (5) incompleteness of the death records; and (6)
errors in recorded ages.

POSSIBLE HAIR DYEING
If there were artificial dyeing of the

‘hair by some individuals, and if these in
dividuals also had lower mortality risks
than others, our results could be explained
by the association between the two factors.
For instance, if dyeing of hair were practiced more by the healthy than by the ill,
our findings could be seriously biased.

The possibility of hair tinting is suggested by the somewhat lower frequency
of gray hair by age group for females than
for males. However, in 1948 we investigated
the possible use of hair dye and found that
while some women were aware of the
practice, none we know of used it. By
1973, dyeing was practiced, but even then
apparently only by young women. We find
it hard to believe that hair dyeing could
be a biasing factor in this study.

HAIR GRAYNESS AND AGE POSITION WITHIN
AGE INTERVALS
Another problem with our mode of
analysis is that even within five-year age
groups there must be some positive correlation of grayness with age. Damon and
Roen report coefficients of correlation of

Vol. 21, No. 3

grayness with age ranging from —0.15 to
+0.30 within ten-year age groups. Our
use of five-year intervals would reduce this
factor to a very small influence.

ASSUMPTION OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
OF GRAYNESS

Our use of a rating scale of only four
points (0, 1, 2, and 3), not necessarily
equally spaced, leads to a distribution of
score differences from the age-sex means
which is not completely normal. For instance, when scored as we have done, the
distribution is truncated at +3 and —3.
Nevertheless, the actual distributions are
roughly symmetrical and normal in appearance. Any departure from normality
would have no effect on the direction of the
difference and only a small effect on estimation of its significance. Non-normality
does not warrant rejection of the implications of the ¢-score, provided that the level
of probability (~) is not taken to be exact.
An alternative nonparametric mode of
analysis, such as the comparison of the
medians of attainment curves, has the disadvantage of losing informational value
from already scant data.

GENETIC TENDENCY TO EARLIER GRAYNESS

To the extent that there is any association of grayness of hair and mortality rates
with racial or ethnic subgroups of the population studied, the tendency would be in
the opposite direction to that observed.
There probably is a tendency for the more
“Indian” members of a mixed Mexican
community to acquire gray hair later in
life than the more “white” members.

The tendency for Indians to show less
grayness than whites in the United States
is a matter of common observation. The
males of the present Mexican series show
less grayness at all ages than a series of
nearly ten thousand Irish males studied
by Hooton and Dupertuis (1951). Among
the Mexicans the majority of individuals
in all five-year age groups under 40 had no

Graying of the Hair and Mortality

293

gray hair, whereas among the Irish the
majority of individuals in all five-year age
groups over 35 already had at least a
submedium degree of graying. Similarly,
we did not record a majority of males with
moderate or more grayness until age 55 in
Mexico, while among the Irish a majority
of males 45-49 years old already showed
medium or pronounced grayness. In a comparable study of inhabitants of three communities on the north coast of Peru
(unpublished), we found graying to proceed as among the Mexicans, but the onset
was often even later than in Mexicans.

Both the Mexican and the Peruvian
populations trace ancestry to both Indians
and Europeans. Although any remaining
significance tends to be cultural, racial
designations retain some biological meaning (Kaplan and Lasker, 1953; Lasker
and Kaplan, 1965). We therefore calculated the grayness scores of the Mexicans
aged 35 or over who listed both parents
as “Indigenes” separately from those of
Mexicans who listed at least one parent
as “Mestizo,” white, or the like. The latter
have higher age-adjusted grayness scores
than the former (¢=— 2.96, »< 0.01).
There is a similar tendency in the Peru\vian population, but there the difference is
not statistically significant.

On the other hand, there is no significant association of ethnic identification
with mortality in any ten-year age group
of either sex. For males aged 35-69, there
was no association of subsequent mortality
with “race.” Among females of these ages,
19.6 per cent of the Indigenes and 9.3
per cent of the Mesétizos had died, but the
difference was not Statistically significant,
and the association is the reverse of that
which would help explain the association
of gray hair with mortality.

INCOMPLETENESS OF DEATH RECORDS

A further difficulty with our data is that
many of the individuals not recorded as

dead may, in fact, have died elsewhere
and not have been recorded in the town.
However, fifteen of the individuals were
known to be alive in 1973 and the distribution of grayness among these appears
random.

ERRORS IN RECORDED AGES

If any reported ages are incorrect, the
individuals who were older than reported
might be grayer and might also have a
higher likelihood of death, and vice versa.
Comparison of ages on the death records
with those of the interviews revealed that
21 of them differed by more than 4 years.
The death-record ages are reported by a
member of the family and are probably
less accurate than the birthdate or age
given by the individual himself a number
of years earlier and used in this study.
In any case, in the few instances where age
in the death records places the individual
in a different five-year age group from that
used, the associations of grayness with the
likelihood of death are increased about as
many times as they are reduced. After
examining the influence of all discrepancies,
we judge the influence of errors in reported
chronological age to be small. The effect
of this factor would be to produce the
association we find, but the extent of the
factor is very small.

ADDITIONAL DATA

Since completing the analysis, the death
records for an additional four years (August, 1969, to August, 1973) have been
examined. An additional 19 deaths of individuals in the series are recorded. In
1948 these individuals had hair slightly
grayer than average for their age and
sex (-+0.23 units). This positive association of death with grayness is almost exactly the same as that recorded for those
dying in the 1948-69 period (-+0.25

Lasker and Kaplan

 

Social Biology

units). However, this finding does not tend
to confirm the association, since the 196973 deaths were all at ages 59-87 (mean
73, median 74) and the individuals are
probably as notable for their survival for
21-25 years past the interview date as
for their deaths in this period. The results
of the present analyses remain merely suggestive.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In summary, among the 480 Mexican
adults examined in 1948, 101 were known
to have died by 1969. Of the 91 who died
of natural causes, those between the ages
of 35 and 69 when examined had, on the
average, grayer hair than others of equivalent sex and age. None of various factors considered seems adequate to explain
this finding. However, the data on nineteen
additional deaths during 1969-73 do not
strengthen the case for an association of
earlier gray hair with earlier mortality,
and the finding is far from unequivocal.

In conclusion, there may be a relationship of graying of hair to senescence. If
confirmed, it may represent a tendency
for pathological processes in some individuals within the population to cause
earlier grayness and, occasionally, earlier
death. If such a cause is merely an early
stage of senescence and not recognizable
as a disease, recognition of such a relationship would be especially important. However, the observed relationship may not
generally be true.

Garn (1973, personal communication)
reports lack of any significant difference
in grayness of hair between coronary disease patients and controls. On the other
hand, Damon and Roen (1973) conclude
that there is a possible association of gray
hair with pulse rate which deserves further
study. We find an association of gray hair
and mortality which is also barely significant and agree that further study is needed.
