Human Biology of the Irish Tinkers:

Demography, Ethnohistory,
and Genetics

Although numerous reports have been
published on the demographic structure
of farming societies (Early, 1970; Erickson et al., 1970; Kunstadter, 1971, 1972;
Halberstein and Crawford, 1972), incipient agriculturally based populations
(Chagnon, 1967, 1968, 1972; Chagnon
et al., 1970), and hunting and gathering
societies (Birdsell, 1968; Yengoyan, 1968;
Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1969; Laughlin,
1972; Turnbull, 1972), little is known
about the demography of the itinerant
populations of Europe. There is considerable information on the genetics of the
Romany Gypsies of Europe (Verzar and
Weszeczky, 1922; Cazal et al., 1952; Ely,
1961; Beckman and Takman, 1965; Nicoli and Sermet, 1965; Avcin, 1969; Galikova et al., 1969; Rex-Kiss and Szabo,
1971; and Clark, 1973). However, most
of these studies include little information
on the fertility, mortality, and migration
patterns of the itinerant populations. A
recent article by Avcin (1969) presents
data on the reproductive histories and
consanguinity of a sample of Gypsies from
Slovenia.

This paper focuses upon an itinerant
population in Ireland, known as the Tin
kers (also called Travellers or Travelling
People). Some demographic data were collected by the Irish Police (Garda) in 1960
and 1961 in order to develop strategies
for integrating Tinkers into settled Irish
society. The results of these censuses were
published in the Report of the Commission
on Itinerancy (Government of Ireland,
1963) and are a basic demographic source
in this report. An additional census taken
by the Department of Local Government
in 1971 and a questionnaire sent to local
authorities in 1972 yielded more data. To
date, no other genetic studies have been
performed on the Irish Tinkers and little
information has been available on gene
frequency distributions in Ireland. Most
genetic studies of Irish populations focus
upon the gene frequencies of one or two
loci (Hart, 1944; Hooper, 1947; Dawson,
1952, 1958, 1964; Hackett, 1958; Hackett
and Folan, 1958; Lundman, 1962; Casey
et al., 1969; Kopec, 1970). More extensive surveys of blood group frequencies
have been conducted by Palsson et al.,
(1970), Sunderland et al. (1973), and
Walter and Palsson (1973).

The primary purpose of this paper is:
(1) to describe the demographic structure

of the Irish Tinker population, and (2) to
discuss the genetic and evolutionary implications of these population parameters.

THE POPULATION

Like the Romany Gypsy, Tinkers were
traditionally wanderers. They traveled regular circuits, usually within the confines
of one or two counties, in patrilineally related groups of two to four families. Tinsmithing was their major occupation, but
they also traded workhorses and asses,
swept chimneys, peddled small wares, and
performed various odd jobs, all in rural
areas. They originally traveled on foot,
then in horse-drawn carts, and more recently in brightly painted barrel-top wagons. They camped on the roadside, usually
on the outskirts of a town, in tents and
wagons. Viewed with fear and suspicion,
they were unwelcome in the settled community and were only permitted to remain
in an area until their work was done,
rarely more than two weeks. This forced
social isolation contributed greatly to
their endogamy.

In the last two decades, the Tinkers’
traditional way of life in rural areas has
been disrupted. Modernization in Ireland
has led to the introduction of new goods
and machinery which have made the Tinkers’ traditional trades obsolete. Plastic
containers and enamelware, for example,
have eliminated the demand for the Tinkers’ handmade tinware. Farm mechanization has replaced the need for workhorses.
Improved roads, the private automobile,
and the expansion of bus service have led
to the demise of peddling, since farm
women are no longer isolated and are now
able to travel to towns to shop.

With the decline in their traditional
occupations, Tinker men have turned primarily to collecting scrap metal and the
women to begging—a direct outgrowth
of peddling but without the pretense of

 

Social Biology

offering something for sale. These new
subsistence patterns are most successfully
pursued in the towns and cities, where
scrap metal and other castoffs are more
plentiful and begging is easier. Simply
because housing is concentrated in urban
areas, female beggars are able to go to
many more homes each day. By the late
1960’s, a substantial majority of Ireland’s
Tinker population had migrated from the
countryside into population centers. By
1971, 248 of Ireland’s 1,302 Tinker families were living on the outskirts of Dublin
alone. In response to the large number of
Tinkers moving into urban areas, the
Itinerant Settlement Movement began in
1965 to help settle Tinkers. The movement, which originated in Dublin but soon
spread nationwide, has used government
financing to construct approximately seventy serviced campsites for Tinker families.

Today, approximately 300 families are
living on government sites. Some are permanently settled while others remain only
a few months before traveling on to a
new location. An additional 150 families
have been housed within the settled community. The remaining 800 families are
still living on the roadside. Some are
highly mobile (e.g., teams of four to five
families who lay asphalt), while others
change camp only a few times each year.
Table 1 shows the per cent of Tinkers
inhabiting different types of accommodations in 1960 and 1972.

The Tinker community has thus far
survived these dramatic changes. Tinkers
remain a social isolate having little contact with members of the settled Irish
community. Furthermore, they still retain
a distinct argot, called Gammin or Cant
which is unintelligible to the settled Irish
population.

some of the popular theories of the ethno

genesis of the Irish Tinkers: (1) The
Tinkers are descendants of the outcasts
who chose to live beyond “the circle of
the Brehon Laws,” the ancient body of
common law of the prehistoric Irish island. (2) The Tinkers are descendants of
native chieftains and their families who,
dispossessed in the successive English
plantations of Ireland, assumed an itinerant life style. MacMahon claims that
the Tinkers of today bear the names of
some of the noblest Irish clans and are
associated with the territories inhabited by
their chieftain ancestors. (3) The Tinkers
are a hybrid population resulting from
admixture between the Irish and the Romany Gypsies. (4) The Tinkers are displaced peasants and laborers driven from
their lands and occupations by economic
upheavals, famine, and conflict. Cromwell’s invasion and conquest of Ireland
(1649-50), followed by the Act of Settlement in 1652, uprooted much of the native
Irish population, forcing them into an
itinerant existence. These new itinerants
swelled the ranks of those artisans and
tinsmiths who traditionally traveled the
roads of Ireland. The blood group frequency data and the genetic distances
between the Tinkers, sedentary Irish, and
Romany Gypsies support the latter hypothesis (Crawford, 1974).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data were collected both from recently
settled Tinkers and from Travellers on the
roads. Three government settlements on
the outskirts of Dublin—Labre Park,
Finglas, and Rathfarnam—were the primary sites of investigation. The annual
turnover in these settlements is approximately 50 per cent, according to one government official, so that there is a constant
influx of Travellers, some permanently
assuming a sedentary life while others return to the road. Out of the 238 Tinkers
interviewed and tested, 126 were encountered on the roads in the counties Dublin,
Wicklow, and Wexford. The remaining 56
per cent of the sample came from the three
government settlements listed above.

Demographic and genealogical information were collected by using a demographic
proforma specifically designed for thé Irish
itinerants. The data were obtained during
two periods of time, during the summer
of 1970 and during 1971-72. Additional
data were also collected by one of us who
spent one year in the field (1971-72).
The demographic data were analyzed and
tested for consistency through comparison
of responses from related individuals on
family size, mortality, place of origin, and
age of spouse. If contradictory responses
from relatives could not be resolved, the
interview was deleted from the sample.

RESULTS

The size of the Tinker population in
Ireland is increasing according to the government censuses. In 1960, the population
of 6,591 itinerants was divided into 1,198
families spread over all of Ireland’s 26
counties. The greatest concentrations of
Tinkers were in Galway, Cork, and Mayo,
in predominantly rural areas. The 1971
census registered an increase in population size with a total of 7,778 Tinkers,
divided into 1,302 families. The greatest

concentrations of Tinkers were in the
urban areas of Dublin, Limerick, and
Galway, reflecting the massive rural-urban
migration which had taken place since the
previous census.

The Tinker population is young, with
52 per cent of the 1960 and 53 per cent

of the 1961 population under 15 years of
age (see Table 2). This high proportion
of children in the population contrasts
markedly with the age structure of the
Irish population, in which only 31.8 per
cent of the males and 30.8 per cent of
the females were under 15 years of age
during the 1968 census. The disparity in
the age structure of the Irish and the
Tinker populations reflects the high fertility of the Tinkers.

The Irish Tinker population exhibits a
slight preponderance of males over females.
The tertiary sex ratio, the number of
males per 100 females in the total population, was 106.16 for 1960 and 106.46 for
1961.

There is some geographical variation in
the relative number of males and females
in the Tinker population. Kilkenny County
exhibits the greatest numerical disparity,
with a sex ratio of 153.26. In contrast,
County Kildare has more Tinker females
than males, with a sex ratio of 87.71. The
disproportionate number of males to females among the Irish Tinkers may be

 

Social Biology

due to the greater likelihood that males
will assume the itinerant way of life. It
is estimated that about 10 per cent of the
parents of today’s Traveller families in
Ireland had left behind them a settled
way of life (Government of Ireland, 1963).
The disproportionate number of males
may also reflect the extreme youthfulness
of the Tinker population.

MATE SELECTION

‘Almost 77 per cent of Tinker marrlages are contracted between partners
born in the same county (see Table 3).

This figure is roughly consistent with the
traditional traveling patterns described in
Table 4, in which 49.66 per cent of the
Tinker community followed circuits within
one county and an additional 23.32 per
cent within one province. Although the
latter group traveled a circuit covering
several counties within a province, they
generally identified themselves with one
county and usually wintered there. The
traditional pattern of choosing mates from
the same county has not been greatly upset by recent urbanization. Although some

Vol. 21, No. 4

of the lineages which formerly exchanged
mates are now dispersed, most urban Tinkers continue to arrange marriages with
families from their home county and increasingly from within their own lineage.

Of the 190 marriages where family
names were recorded, 24 or 12.63 per cent
were isonymous (marriage of two individuals who have the same family name).
This frequency of isonymy among the
Tinkers is comparable to the frequency
reported in two isolated Italian Alpine
communities, Bellino with 13.82 per cent
isonymy in 1851~70, and Casteldelfino
with 11.59 per cent isonymy for marriages
occurring in 1866-77 (Lasker et al., 1972).
Lower isonymy rates were detected in
contemporary Mexican Indian farming
communities, with 2.16 per cent of the
marriages being isonymous in San Pablo,
Tlaxcala, and 1.3 per cent in the City of
Tlaxcala (Halberstein, 1972).

Unfortunately, the exact levels of inbreeding cannot be computed since a number of the genealogies are incomplete.
Numerous instances of first- and secondcousin marriages were identified in several
of the more complete genealogies. Masterson’s (1970) study of the frequency of
consanguineous marriages between Catholics in all of Ireland from 1958 to 1968
revealed that only 1 in 625 marriages were
contracted between first cousins. However,
five first-cousin marriages were observed
in the Rathfaram settlement in 1971-72.
These data support Masterson’s contention
that the itinerants may contribute substantially to the: published consanguinity
figures.

AGE OF MARRIAGE

It appears that the Tinkers are presently marrying at a younger age than
during the previous generation. The combined mean age of marriage of the Tinkers
interviewed is 18.17 years for females and

21.61 years for males. However, a subdivision of the sample into two generations
(those born prior to 1930 and those born
after 1930) suggests that members of the
present generation marry at an average of
2 years younger than during the previous
generation (see Table 5).

The earlier age of marriage has been
attributed to the parents’ desire to marry
off their daughters as close to puberty as
possible in order to protect their virginity
and prevent an illegitimate pregnancy
(Gmelch, 1973). Parents are careful to
protect girls from having premarital affairs
because the loss of virginity would ruin a
girl’s reputation and make it very difficult
to find her a suitable marriage partner.
An illegitimate child would disgrace the
family and most likely result in the unwed
mother being ostracized from the group.
Traditionally, the activities of single
girls were closely supervised. Girls were
never permitted to be alone in the company of boys their age. In the traditional
rural setting, close supervision was possible because camps were small and isolated
from nearby villages as well as from other
Tinkers. If parents discovered or suspected
that their daughter was secretly seeing a
boy in camp, they simply left the group.
Today, however, camps tend to be large
and much less isolated. In these camps,
particularly in urban areas, there are many

326 Crawford and Gmelch

opportunities for undetected meetings between the sexes. Also, most teenage girls
are absent from the camp and therefore
beyond their parents’ supervision several
hours each day while begging. Because
Tinkers are more sedentary today, it is
not so easy for parents to leave camp
every time that they suspect that their
daughter is seeing a boy. Powerless to
prevent illicit courtship and thus to protect their daughter’s reputation, Tinker
parents today are arranging marriages
(“matches”) for their daughters at an
earlier age.

FERTILITY

The Tinkers exhibit a high rate of
achieved reproduction; the mean number
of children per prolific woman 40 years of
age and older is 10.43, with a variance
of 22.39 (see Table 6). The mean fertility

rate of the Tinkers is one of the highest

population is 7.94 with a variance of 2.68.
The Report of the Commission on Itin
 

 

Social Biology

erancy (Government of Ireland, 1963)
estimates an average of 6-7 children per
family of Tinkers. The disparity between
the mean derived from interviews and the
lower government census results may be
the result of the slight fertility increase
noted earlier in the paper.

This high fertility of the Tinkers can
be explained in part by the long reproductive careers of the females who, on the
average, are married at 18 years of age
and continue reproducing until age 40 or
45. Upon the completion of its reproductive activity, the average Tinker family
has produced at least 13 live births, and
one still birth. Three of their children will
die during the first 15 years of life. Given
a reproductive span of 22 to 27 years,
Tinker women conceive more frequently
than once every two years.

These frequent pregnancies are a nutritional drain on the female. The number
of calories estimated to be necessary to
sustain a single pregnancy is 80,000 (FAO,
1957). The caloric cost of 14 pregnancies
carried to term is 1,120,000 calories over
and above the required intake of 2,200
calories per day. More important are the
additional protein requirements of a lactating female, who would need an intake
of 98 grams of protein daily. If a woman
breastfeeds each child for nine months,
the additional protein requirement is
26,460 grams (White et al., 1964). Thus,
an Irish Tinker female with 14 pregnancies would require an additional intake of
1,120,000 grams of protein. Since the diet
of the Tinkers is marginal at best, the
additional protein needs would place a
great deal of stress on the organism.

Undoubtedly, these fertility and reproductive wastage rates are gross underestimates of the actual rates of neonatal
mortality, stillbirths, and spontaneous
abortions, since these figures were collected
through the use of a demographic pro

forma, Although these questionnaires have
built-in tests for internal consistency and
are cross-checked by interviewing close
relatives, these results must be considered
preliminary.

There appears to be a significant difference in the achieved reproduction rates
of the recently settled Tinkers and those
Tinkers still living on the roadside. The
mean number of children in the three government settlements is 9.73, in comparison
to 5.70 children among the Tinkers who
have maintained a more mobile life style.
This fertility difference is probably due to
the earlier age of marriage and to a reduction in the infant mortality rates. The
settled Tinkers have better access to med

vealed that 32.00 per cent of all children
born fail to reach 15 years of age. For a
Western European population, this death
rate is exceptionally high; however, in a
Mexican agricultural community, Cuanalan, more than 50 per cent of the children
born fail to reach 15 years of age.

A population such as the Irish Tinkers,
with high neonatal mortality and high
fertility has the potential for rapid evolutionary change. Crow (1958, 1966) proposed an index for the opportunity of
natural selection based upon the mortality
and fertility structure of the population.
In comparison with agricultural and urban
societies, Crow’s index is of medium intensity among the Irish Tinkers. In Table 7,

MORTALITY

A more complete treatment of mortality
and morbidity of the Irish Tinkers will be
presented in a subsequent paper. The
Travellers experience high mortality and
morbidity during the first year of life and
until 15 years of age. The Report of the
Commission on Itinerancy (Government
of Ireland, 1963) claims that 12.50 per
cent of 13,033 children born failed to
reach two years of age. Reconstruction of
reproductive wastage and infant and child
mortality based on questionnaires re
 

the total indices and the fertility and
mortality components of the Tinkers are
compared to published values for other societies of various economic and cultural
types. The demographic attributes of the
Irish Tinkers suggest that if disease favored a specific genotype, selection would
proceed at an intermediate level of intensity.

§ Phenotypic frequencies.

frequencies of the Irish Tinkers are similar
to those of the Kilkenny and Irish composite. Some significant gene frequency
differences between the Tinkers and the
Irish are also evident. At the Rhesus blood
group locus, the cDE chromosomal segment has an exceptionally high incidence
among the Tinkers—more than twice the
frequency found in the Kilkenny population. The Tinkers also exhibit anomalous
frequencies of the p* allele at the acid

phosphatase locus and the P-+ phenotype
at the P locus; the Hp! gene has a relatively low frequency when compared with
the Kilkenny and Irish samples.

GENETIC DISTANCES

Sanghvi’s chi-square method was used
to compare the Tinker gene frequencies

lations. It provides a measure of divergence
based on differences in frequencies over
any number of loci (Sanghvi, 1953). Computation of distance was based upon 14
alleles and chromosomal segments from
four genetic systems, ABO, Rh, MN, and
Haptoglobin. Although allelic frequencies
for 15 systems were available for the Irish
Tinkers and Kilkenny, fewer systems are
available for other populations, and the
greater the number of populations used
in the analysis, the fewer the available
allelic frequencies. Table 10 summarizes
the computed genetic distances between
ten populations or geographical groups.
The allelic frequencies representing England and Iceland were compiled from
Mourant (1954) and Giblett (1969);
Hungarian Gypsy, Hungarian, and Punjab
frequencies were obtained from Rex-Kiss
et al. (1973). Ireland is represented by the
Palsson et al. (1970) study.

These genetic-distance measures suggest
that the Tinkers are closest genetically to
the Irish populations. What is surprising
is that the Hungarians appear to be closer
genetically to the Tinkers than to the
English. The Tinkers differ most from the
Icelandic sample, which is surprising considering the known historical relationship
between Iceland and Ireland. This difference can in part be explained on the basis
of the Tinkers’ social isolation. While the

Tinkers are the closest genetically to the
surrounding Irish populations, they appear
to have diverged at a number of loci.

CONCLUSIONS

This study reveals that the Irish Tinkers constitute a social isolate, but the
population does not appear to have diverged significantly in all of the genetic
systems. Significant differences between
the Irish Tinkers and the sedentary populations exist at certain loci, but these
differences are often obscured by the problems associated with sampling.

Demographically, the Tinkers appear to
be in a state of transition resulting from

Social Biology

the governmental attempts at settling
them. Judging from the recent changes in
the age of marriage and in the preliminary
fertility data, it is likely that the Irish
Tinkers will continue to show an increase
in achieved reproduction. With the possible settlement of these traveling people,
it is probable that this social isolate will
continue to break down and may eventually lose its genetic and cultural distinctiveness.
