Seasonality of Birth:

Two Findings from the Decennial Census

ABSTRACT: Two results on the seasonality of birth phenomenon are derived from tabulations of
1980 census data: first, that the familiar pattern of spring trough and summer peak prevailed in
the decades before the establishment of a national birth registration data system; second, that
the seasonal pattern is most pronounced for the lower socioeconomic group.

Live births in the United States have
for some time followed a pattern of
spring trough and summer peak—at
least since the initiation of the national
birth registration system in 1933. The
pattern is known to be more pronounced for the South than for other regions and for blacks than for whites (National Center for Health Statistics,
1978). We have determined that this
pattern (1) existed as far back as the
1890’s, and (2) currently is more pronounced for lower than for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings come
from an analysis of census population
data, rather than vital registration data.

The enigmatic seasonality of births in
the United States has been analyzed extensively, but gaps in the knowledge of
this phenomenon exist along dimensions not accessed by the national vital
registration system. For example, did
the familiar pattern of spring trough and
summer peak hold in the early part of
this century as well? The conclusion of
one study (Shimura et al., 1981), based
on a small sample of birthdays collected
from baptism and gravestone records in
two States, is that the distribution of

U.S. births in the late 1800’s and early
1900’s exhibited a spring peak, as is
found commonly among European
countries. The authors offer little in the
way of a theoretical basis for such a shift
in the seasonal pattern of births, if it indeed took place.

With respect to differentials in the
amplitude of the seasonal pattern
among population subgroups, geographic and racial differentials are easily
derived from the comprehensive tabulation of live births by month and state and
race appearing in the annual Vital Statistics publication of natality data. On the
other hand, because socioeconomic information is not collected on the standard birth certificate, the association between socioeconomic status of parents
and the extent of seasonality of birth has
been studied only on the local level: in
Baltimore (Pasamanick et al., 1960;
Zelnik, 1969; Chaudhury, 1972), New
York City (Erhardt et al., 1971), and
Fulton County, Georgia (Warren and
Tyler, 1981).

Generally, these investigations found
greater seasonality among lower soctoeconomic groups than among higher so

cioeconomic groups. Warren and Tyler,
in fact, report an absence of seasonality
for their highest socioeconomic group.
Although Zelnik reports that the difference between his groups is not statistically significant according to a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test,
a different test focused more narrowly
on the spring and summer periods may
well have yielded a significant result.

The theory which seems to be most
highly regarded—although none are
compelling—for explaining the phenomenon of seasonality of births is the
biometeorological one, that is, that climate affects man’s physiological and reproductive performance. The socioeconomic differential is then seen as a
reflection of the greater ability of those
better-off to control climate, for example through air-conditioning and by vacationing in more moderate environments. Similarly, Seiver (1985) has
shown that the dimunition of the spring
trough over time may be attributed to
the increase in the number of homes
with air-conditioning.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

If the pattern of seasonality of births
before the 1930’s and the question of socioeconomic differentials on a national
scale are to be studied at all, some data
source other than the vital registration
system must be found. The approach of
Coale and Zelnik (1963) to the problem
of estimating the numbers of births occurring annually before the 1930’s
comes immediately to mind. They reconstructed an annual series of births
from tabulations of decennial censuses
by applying the obvious relationship
that living persons born x years ago are
age x in the census.

Our analysis is based on the 1980
Census of Population public-use “B”

sample, a tape file consisting of records
for a 1 per cent sample of households selected from among those who completed the “long” census form (Bureau
of the Census, 1983). The record content includes age last birthday in single
years through age 89 or as 90 and over,
quarter of birth, and place of birth;
hence the numbers of persons born in
the United States in each calendar quarter after 1890 who survived to Apmil 1,
1980, are easily obtained.

In the calculation by Coale and
Zelnik (1963) of the annual levels of
births predating national birth registration, it was, of course, necessary to combine the census population counts with .
estimated probabilities of survival from
birth to the census. For the present analysis, on the other hand, which is concerned with the relative numbers of
births in the four calendar quarters, the
population data themselves can be used,
with some adjustment, if one plausible
assumption holds. It is assumed here
that survivorship is unrelated to season
of birth, that persons born in any one
season are no less healthy than persons
born in any other season.

We are aware that one conjecture of
Pasamanick and his coworkers (1960) to
explain the spring trough in births is that
conceptions in the “unhealthy” summer
months are subject to excessive fetal
deaths. This, however, is not one of the
major theories and is not even explicitly
mentioned by Kevan (1979) in his review article. Moreover, a recent, comprehensive study (Warren et al., 1986)
concludes that the monthly variation for
abortions and ectopic pregnancies is not
significant, once the seasonality of conception is controlled. Similarly, the seasonality of stillbirths is minor (Slatis and
Decloux, 1967).

Two adjustments must be made to

year and quarter of birth. First, to adjust
them to the levels which would have
been attained were the four calendar
quarters equal parts of the year, with
due recognition of the need for different
adjustments for leap years and other
years.

The second adjustment is for length
of survival. In any cohort, those born
earlier in the year must survive longer
than those born later in the year to reach
April 1, 1980. Accordingly, survival
probabilities for 3, 6, and 9 months specific to age, sex, and race were applied to
persons born in the second, third, and
fourth quarters of the year, respectively.
These probabilities were derived from
the U.S. Decennial Life Tables for
1979-81 (National Center for Health
Statistics, 1985).

RESULTS
SEASONALITY BEFORE THE 1930's

From 1980 census population counts
for the native-born by year and quarter
of birth, adjusted as described above, it
is clear that births were fewer than average in spring and more than average in
summer in the four decades prior to the

1930’s. The sample of baptism .and
gravestone records in two states which
exhibited a spring peak, cited earlier,
was either a too-small or an unrepresentative sample.

The census data are summarized in
the left-hand panel of Table 1. Birth cohorts are combined into 10-year groups,
and the statistic presented in each table
cell is the ratio of births during a 10-year
period occurring in the given calendar
quarter to one-quarter of all births occurring during the period. Sample sizes
are also shown.

One can also learn from the table that
births in the fourth quarter were more
numerous than births in the first quarter
during the decades after 1940, while before then the opposite was true. Unfortunately, we cannot explain this reversal.

The right-hand panel of Table 1 is
based on counts of births since 1933
given in publications of the National
Center for Health Statistics (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1977; National Center for Health Statistics,
1966). The agreement is gratifyingly
close, supporting this study’s premise
that adjusted census population counts

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS

For an investigation of socioeconomic differentials in seasonal birth patterns based on census records, the births
to be studied must be fairly recent, so as
to minimize the chance that the socioeconomic status of the parents has
changed between the birth and the census date; yet they must also be extensive
enough to support statistically valid inferences. Accordingly, this aspect of the
study is based on births between 1977
and 1979, and the results reported have
been successfully tested for significance.

Socioeconomic information available
in the public-use file includes educational attainment and a code which classifies the family’s income position relative to the poverty level appropriate to
the family’s composition. We used each
of these to partition the sample into
three categories. With respect to family
income in 1979 the groupings are: below

the poverty level, above the poverty
level but below twice the poverty level,
and above twice the poverty level. The
three categories for the schooling of the
head of household are: did not finish
high school, finished high school but did
not begin college, and had some college.
The measures of socioeconomic status
used in the local studies cited earlier are:
educational attainment of mother, average property value in the census tract of
residence, and whether the hospital
service was general service or private
service.

We find, both for the income and the
education measure, that while the pattern of spring trough and summer peak
is common to all socioeconomic classes,
differentials in the amplitude of the pattern do exist, with seasonality greatest
for the lowest class. The magnitude of
the difference between the lowest and
highest socioeconomic classes is comparable to the magnitudes of Black-White
and South-Other differences. These
results are shown in Table 2, where,

again, the statistic given is the ratio of
births during the period occurring in the
given calendar quarter to one-fourth of
all births for the period.

CONCLUSION

The puzzling seasonal pattern of
birth continues to be a topic for re

search, including some promising work
in which women are asked to explain
what their seasonal preference is
(Rodgers, 1984). Here we have used
census data in an innovative way to address two aspects of the phenomenon
which had heretofore not been adequately treated.
