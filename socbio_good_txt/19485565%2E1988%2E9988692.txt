ABSTRACT: 224 subjects from 5 different racial/ethnic groups responded to a dating
questionnaire. There are both sex and racial/ethnic differences in frequency of cross-ethnic
dating in Hawaii and in attitudes (as reported by Ss) of parents and close friends toward withinand across-ethnic dating. Females date within their own groups more frequently than males
8 and also report stronger support of within- and lesser support of across-group dating by
significant others. Racial/ethnic differences are substantial, with groups higher in mean
income being more supportive of within-group dating, being more accepted by other groups,
and being less accepting of dating other groups. Amount of actual intergroup dating was
related, in part, to group differences in income, with the two groups lowest in income (Filipinos
and Hawaiians/Part Hawaiians) showing the highest amount of cross-ethnic dating, but with
the association breaking down in the upper income groups, possibly because of group
differences in group size and in length of residence. The results are remarkably similar to those
reported earlier on within- and across-group marriage in Hawaii.

There has been an historic trend toward an increased frequency of intergroup marriage in Hawaii (Glick, 1970;
Lind, 1980; Johnson, 1984). The most
recent data (State of Hawaii, 1985, p.
102) show 46.3 per cent of the 1984 marriages in which at least one member of
the couple was a Hawaii resident to be
intergroup marriages.

There are a number of reasons for
this very high rate of intergroup marriage. First, there are many groups
present in substantial numbers. There
are five major ethnic groups as well as
many other ethnic groups comprising
less than 1 per cent of the population,
and a large group of mixed ancestry.
The major groups, in numerical order,
are Caucasian, 241,872 (24.5 per cent);
Japanese, 228,341 (23.2 per cent);
Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian, 196,805 (19.9
per cent); Filipino, 111, 607 (11.3 per
cent); and Chinese, 46,793 (4.7 per
cent) (State of Hawaii, 1985). Second,

from the 1790’s onward (when the first
non-Hawaiians settled in Hawaii), intergroup marriage has been viewed favorably, probably because each group had
resources that the other group desired
(Johnson and Nagoshi, 1986). Third,
the general tolerance of and interest in
the ways of life of others, on the part of
the native Hawaiian population—in a
sense, their “spirit of aloha’ —may have
worked to keep intermarriage rates
high.

A number of variables influence who
marries whom. The proportion of intergroup marriage is inversely related to
group size (Johnson, 1984). More than
19 out of every 20 potential marriage
partners a Chinese-American might encounter are not Chinese, while roughly
only two of every three potential marriage partners a Japanese-American or a
Caucasian-American encounters are
members of other groups. The smaller
the group, the higher the proportion of

103

outmarriage. Other variables also influence outmarriage rates. The per cent
of outmarriage is lower in first marriages
than in later marriages (Jedlicka, 1975)
and in higher than in lower occupational
groups (Schmitt, 1971). If outmarriage
occurs, the probability of members of a
given group marrying a member of any
other group is substantially influenced
by group income. Persons who outmarry marry into groups with mean incomes similar to their own. This tendency 1s somewhat stronger for females
than for males (Johnson, 1984). The
most recent income data, for 1979 (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1983), shows the
following mean family incomes in Hawail: Caucasian, $26,557; Chinese,
$32,388; Filipino, $22,921; Hawaitian/
Part Hawaiian, $22,166; Japanese,
$31,994.

Personality factors also influence
marital choice. Women who outmarry
differ substantially from women who
marry within their own group. Adjective Check List (Gough and Heilbrun,
1965) data for women who married two
or more decades ago showed them to be
significantly higher in dominance, exhibitionism, autonomy, and aggression
and lower in abasement and deference.
Men who married across vs. within
groups differed a good deal less. Adjective Check List data showed them to be
lower in endurance and in orderliness.
This data set (Ahern et al., 1981) also
showed that the less the proportion of
outmarriage, within given sex and ethnic groups, the greater the difference
between those who married across vs.
within racial/ethnic groups. Basically,
only unusual persons did unusual things.
The Ahern et al. data set was based on
data acquired from persons whose average age was in the mid-40’s, and who
provided the data over a decade ago.

Social Biology

Since outmarriage has increased substantially over time, personality. differences between those who marry across
vs. Within racial/ethnic groups might be
expected to have decreased.!

The present report has to do with dating, not marriage; but dating is a prelude
to marriage and patterns of within- or
across-group dating should be predictive, to a degree, of marriage patterns.
A person who dates only members of his
or her own group might be expected to
be less likely to marry across groups
than a person who often dated members
of other groups.

Our purposes, in the present paper,
are to assess (1) the dating patterns of
males and of females from a variety of
racial ethnic groups, (2) the daters’
judgments of how their family and close
friends would regard their dating of
members of their own and of each of the
other four major groups, and (3) the association of group income with the dating patterns of group members and with
the acceptability of group members to
persons of other groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects were recruited from various
undergraduate psychology courses.
Their sex and ethnicity is described in
Table 1.

The proportion of persons in different racial/ethnic groups closely approximates their proportional representation
in the general student body. The

1All of the subjects assessed in the present report were administered the Comrey Personality
Scales (Comrey, 1970). The association of dating
behavior with scores in the eight construct and two
validity scales of the Comrey was ascertained for
males and females separately. Only one of the
twenty correlations (more extroverted females
cross-ethnically more often) was significant.

RESULTS

As will be reported below, there are
sex differences, both in the attitudes of
family and friends toward out-group
dating and in actual dating practices.
Therefore, despite the small numbers,
for some groups when divided by sex, it
is necessary to report our data sepa
rately for the two sexes. Reported dating practices are presented in Table 2.
When males and females are divided
into 3 groups (date only or mostly own
group; 50/50; date mostly or only other
groups.) a X? of 13.93 2 df, (P < 0.001),
indicates a higher amount of crossethnic dating for males than for females.
Reported attitudes of family and
close friends toward dating members of
each S’s own group and toward members of the other four groups were
scored as follows: positive = 1; neutral = 2; negative = 3. Mean reported

‘attitudes of the families and friends of

S’s of each group toward dating are presented in Table 3.

Males and females of each of the five
ethnic groups reported the attitudes of
family and friends toward dating members of each of four other groups. Males
reported more favorable attitudes toward intergroup dating on the part of
significant others in sixteen of the
twenty comparisons, and report significant others to be less supportive of
within-group dating in 4 of 5 comparisons. In all, the males report significant
others to be more accepting of intergroup dating and less supportive of
within-group dating in 20 of 25 comparisons. A binomial test (Siegel, 1956, pp.
36-42) shows this differences between
the sexes in reported attitudes to be
significant (p < 0.01).

friends toward within- and across-group
dating, reported attitudes of family and
friends of the combined other ethnic
groups toward dating members of each
group, and reported dating practices.
Groups are ordered in terms of income,
rather than alphabetically. Data (all
available above) are in the forms of
ranks. Income, the degree of favorableness that members of a group regard
within group dating, and the degree to
which the combined members of other
groups report favorable attitudes toward each group are ranked from 1 to 5
(from highest or most to lowest or least).
The degree to which members of groups
report that their significant others re
 

gard other groups favorably (mean for
all groups) and the degree of intergroup
dating are ranked in reverse from (1)
least positive regard of other groups and
least intergroup dating to (5) highest regard for other groups and most intergroup dating.

DISCUSSION

Much of the discussion presented below has to do with sex and ethnic differences in dating practices, in the reported
attitudes of significant others toward
within- and across-group dating, and in
the relation of dating and reported attitudes toward dating as these measures

relate to group income. Before discussing these results—which imply the existence of prejudice against outgroup
members, more on the part of parents
and friends of females than of males,
and more on the part of high- than lowincome groups—we should remark on
the generally benign aspects of inter
group relations in Hawaii. Mean attitudes with numerical values of 2.01 or
more fall on the negative end of the acceptance continuum. Of the forty attitudes toward outgroups (5 groups x 4
outgroups X 2 sexes) shown in Table 3,
only 12 are values of 2.01 or more. A
sign test (Siegel, 1956, pp. 68-75) shows

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

favorable attitudes to be more frequent
than unfavorable attitudes (z = 2.37;
p <0.05). Subjects believe that their
family and friends are far more often
positive than negative in their attitudes
toward other groups. Further, 117 of the
224 Ss (52.23 per cent) date members of
ethnic groups other than their own 50
per cent of the time or more, while only
29 of the 224 (12.95 per cent) date only
members of their own group. In general, then there is very little feeling
against intergroup dating, and intergroup dating is very common.

There are differences in positiveness
within this positive atmosphere. There
usually is more negative feeling on the
part of significant others regarding intergroup dating and more positive feeling
regarding within-group dating reported
by females than by males, and females
do, in fact, date members of other
groups less often than do males. As Table 3 indicates, some ethnic groups are
regarded more positively than are others by S’s families and friends. Some
groups are more accepting in general of
other groups than others. Table 4 indicates that group acceptability both in its
own eyes and in the eyes of others 1s positively associated with mean group income. The degree of positiveness expressed by members of each group
toward other groups is negatively associated with income, and the higher one’s
own group income the less acceptable
the other groups are. These dating data
are highly similar to marriage data
(Johnson, 1984) which showed that persons tended to outmarry into groups
similar to their own in income, and the
greater the discrepancy in group income, the less probable the intermarriage of persons from different racial/
ethnic groups.

Social Biology

Actual intergroup dating is not as
closely related to income as are reported
attitudes. Persons of Filipino and of
Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian ancestry are
lowest in income; subjects from these
groups report that their significant others are less supportive of within-group
dating and more accepting of across
group-dating, and also report a high degree of across-group dating. The three
higher income groups, persons of Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian ancestry, do not show the same comparability between income and dating patterns.
Chinese, who report the lowest degree
of acceptance of other groups by family
and friends, are intermediate in actual
dating. This result is stmilar to that reported for marriage data (Johnson,
1984). Parents and significant others of
Chinese young men and women may be
opposed to both intergroup dating and
marriage, but still have little influence
on dating and marriage patterns merely
because of the small percentage of Chinese. No matter what attitudes exist, 19
of every 20 potential spouses of Chinese
young men and women are from groups
other than Chinese. Caucasians are relatively accepting of others, but are low in
intergroup dating. This probably is a
consequence of relatively recent residence in Hawaii (33 of the 41 Caucasians, as compared with only 25 of the
183 members from the other four groups
reported residing on the U.S. mainland
for 6 or more years). The low crossethnic dating of Caucasians again parallels the comparatively low rate of intergroup marriage of Caucasians
(especially Caucasian females) found in
marriage data (Johnson, 1984).

The present data indicate that crossethnic dating is well accepted in Hawaii
and occurs with substantial frequency
