Screening the Vasectomy Applicant:
Reassessing the Importance of Eligibility Criteria

ABSTRACT: All family planning clinics and a random sample of private physicians throughout
the United States were surveyed in 1972 and 1984 to discern the importance of eligibility criteria
in the process of screening vasectomy applicants. In general, age and parity expectations have
become significantly more flexible and liberal over a decade of waning vasectomy popularity.
Physicians in the two surveys tend to ascribe greater importance than does clinical staff to marital status, religious conflicts, marital stability, and spousal consent. Both groups currently
place less emphasis on eligibility criteria than they did twelve years ago.

In the early 1970’s, the popularity of
elective vasectomy was becoming increasingly evident. The rate of increase
of both vasectomies performed and applicants refused the procedure by private physicians and family planning clinics showed a sharp and steady upward
swing. Other national data confirmed a
trend of increased incidence (Uhlman,
1974; Nations Health, 1971).

In contrast to the increasing incidence of elective vasectomy, medical literature suggested a wide range of potential eligibility requirements for men
seeking performance of the procedure.
Little consistency was apparent among
authors regarding the commonly advocated eligibility criteria of age, parity,
psychological fitness, maturity, mutual
agreement of applicant and spouse, degree of knowledge of the operative procedure, marital stability, religious compatibility, length of time vasectomy had
been considered prior to application,
psychosomatic iliness, and other related
factors.

Suggestions in the literature ranged
from an unnecessarily restrictive and

cautious posture to omission of any specific criteria. In the absence of authoritative medical guidelines, authors’ suggested criteria have generally reflected
intuitive and experiential qualities. Earlier sources (Carlson, 1970; Erling,
1971; Parker, 1967) are typical of divergent approaches to criteria. More recent
literature, generally physiologically focused (Husset, 1981; Lancet, 1983),
seems less restrictive but still reflects a
continued idiosyncratic pattern. The
processes of assessing and determining
eligibility and of interviewing and counseling the applicant have also been addressed in a haphazard fashion (Uhlman, 1975).

In an effort to determine more accurately the actual utilization and application of eligibility criteria by physicians
and family planning clinic staff, a study
was conducted which elicited the importance of specific factors in assessing the
suitability of applicants for the operative
procedure (Uhiman, 1973).

The present article reports replicated
survey results of the above noted study
conducted following a twelve year inter

val. In addition to determining the current utilization of eligibility criteria, the
replicated study provides data to compare and contrast changes over time. It
is possible, therefore, to observe
changes and emerging trends in the
screening and selection of vasectomy
applicants at primary service delivery
sites: private physician offices and family planning clinics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In both the 1972 and 1984 studies,
random samples of private physicians
and all clinics were surveyed throughout
the United States. A mailed questionnaire was used to gather data from 114
private physicians and 72 clinics in 1972,
and 97 physicians and 78 clinics in 1984.

Although both clinics and private
physicians were self-selected (i.e., all
had placed their names voluntarily on
the Association for Voluntary Sterilization roster to be recipients of referrals),
the survey populations appeared to be
essentially representative of their counterparts throughout the health care system.

Since vasectomy performance is
available through both clinic services
and private physicians, it was possible to
note only the overall configuration of eligibility criteria in the service system,
but also differences between the service
delivery modes. In the former, eligibility criteria and decisions potentially involve an interdisciplinary approach
(i.e., the consultation between physician, nurse, social worker, counselor,
etc.), while in the latter the private physician would shoulder sole responsibility. A primary objective of the study was
to compare and contrast criteria within
the context of the two delivery modes.

Respondents were asked a series of

Screening the Vasectomy Applicant

103

questions about criteria that had been
established and were followed in the decision to accept or reject a vasectomy
applicant. Specific areas of interest resolved around: the youngest age range
of acceptability; age and parity combinations that would be acceptable; the
importance of religious conflicts, marital status, marital stability, spouse consent, and emotional stability; and the
length of time that vasectomy should
have been considered by the applicant
prior to application.

Individual clinics and private physicians devote different amounts of time
to the performance of vasectomy in their
total services. This factor was controlled
so that assessment was possible of its potential influence on eligibility criteria.
Significant differences between physicians and clinics were viewed in terms of
chi-square tabulations.

RESULTS

In order to control for the differing
amounts of time devoted to vasectomy
performance among service agents, it
was necessary to determine the proportion both groups devoted exclusively to
the operative procedure. This did not
seem to vary greatly between the
groups. Few clinics or physicians devoted more than 25 per cent of their
time to the performance of vasectomy.

In Table 1, it can be noted that neither clinics nor physicians were heavily
invested solely in vasectomy performance. This pattern is consistent between
the two studies, and no statistical differences were apparent between the study
populations. In general, aslightly higher
number of clinics spend more time in
vasectomy performance, while physiclans tend to spend somewhat less time
performing the procedure. One trend is

apparent for both groups. Clinics and
physicians both report less time devoted
to vasectomy performance in 1984 (as
reflected in the 10 per cent level data)
than they did twelve years ago.

Review of the literature shows that a
common measure of eligibility has been
the age of an applicant. In 1972 clinics
were more likely than physicians to accept younger applicants, as illustrated in
Table 2, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, in the
present survey, significantly more clinics
than physicians reported acceptance of
younger men (P < .02). It is remarkable
that in 1972 nearly 20 per cent of clinics
expected applicants to be between 27
and 34 years old, but in 1984 this expectation had decreased to less than 5 per
cent of clinic services. Increases in clinic
percentages for 22-26 and 18-21 age
ranges are likewise impressive. Generally, clinics have accepted younger vasectomy applicants than have physicians,
and this trend has apparently accelerated over time.

Age alone is only one dimension,
since family parity has often been advocated in the literature as a factor to be
coupled with age for eligibility criteria.
In the survey questionnaire, several al
ternatives were offered the respondents

coupling age and family parity in various
combinations reflecting degrees of restrictiveness and flexibility. In Table 3,
the selection of age-parity criteria is
shown for both groups; percentages
reflect the number of respondents selecting each item as a group.

In 1972 data tended to picture private
physicians as significantly less flexible
than clinics in their age-parity expectation for vasectomy applicants. The
lower three age-parity categories dramatically illustrate this pattern. However, in 1984 fewer differences seem to
exist between groups. |

Indeed, for private physicians, the
per cent increase from 1972 to 1984 for
the younger-age and lower-parity categories has been remarkable. Similar
data for clinics seem to show a converse
trend, reflecting less flexibility in ageparity criteria. However, more clinic respondents (27 per cent vs. 13 per cent)
noted that age-parity criteria were not
specifically appropriate to or compatible
with their overall eligibility criteria. Frequent unsolicited remarks indicated that
eligibility decisions rested more on
other criteria than age or parity and
were handled on a case-by-case basis.

In general, data from both clinic and
private physician groups seem to reflect

a more flexible and liberal application of
age and parity eligibility criteria compared to the earlier study.

At the time, the 1972 data suggested
that not only were private physicians
more concerned about legal ramifications (self-protection and defensive
medicine) and maturity of the applicant,
but also higher parity tended to insure
against potential untoward reactions
and misgivings in the event of the death
of progeny. Recent survey data seems to
suggest that these concerns are less important today than in the past.

Several additional factors are frequently suggested in the literature as potential criteria of eligibility. Among
these factors are: religious conflicts,
marital status (whether unmarried men
should be vasectomized), marital stability, spouse consent, history of emotional
instability, and period of time vasectomy has been considered prior to application. Respondents were asked to designate whether these were important
factors in consideration of eligibility
within an “agree”, “disagree,” or “notimportant” context. Questions were ar
ranged so that responses of agreement
would indicate a more restrictive stance,
while disagreement or unimportance
would reflect a less restrictive posture.
In Table 4, responses of the two groups
are shown regarding attitudes toward
the above criteria, excluding time of
consideration prior to vasectomy application.

Private physicians selected spousal
consent, marital stability, and religious
conflicts to receive highest agreement
responses in both the original study and
the replicated 1984 survey. Clinics mirrored this pattern, except that emotional stability received relatively high
importance also.

In 1972 no statistical significance existed between the data for the two
groups, although spouse consent approached the 0.05 level indicating
higher importance for physicians. In
1984 statistical differences between
groups existed for most eligibility criteria: religious conflicts (P < 0.001), marital status (P< 0.001), marital stability
(P<0.05) and wife’s consent
(P < 0.001). Although emotional stabil

If “strongly agree’ and “‘agree”’ percentages are combined, as displayed in
Table 5, a rank order of eligibility criteria is shown which reflects the relative
Strength of each category for both
groups. Also discernible is the relative
decrease of importance for each over
time. It becomes apparent that the
group statistical differences noted above

are the result of a much greater rate of
decrease evident for clinic services.
While physicians’ selections remained substantially the same from
1972 to 1984 (1 = spouse consent,
2 = tie between marital stability and religious conflicts), clinic ranking of criteria shifted significantly. In 1972 spouse

consent was the primary factor, with religious conflicts of secondary importance, and marital stability and emotional stability nearly equal in a third
level of importance. However, by 1984,
clinics have deemphasized significantly
the factor of spouse consent in favor of
the emotional stability of the vasectomy
applicant. Importance of other criteria
is significantly less than indicated in the
1972 study.

Whether an applicant had considered
the operative procedure for a necessary
or specified length of time prior to seeking surgery was not important to roughly
one-third of the 1972 and 1984 respondents. It is interesting that more physicians specified a time period in 1984, and
in general those noting a preferred time
selected alternatives of shorter duration
in both instances. The clinic pattern
roughly mirrored that of physicians except that six months was the most frequently selected alternative. No statistical differences were apparent in the
groups’ data (See Table 6).

CONCLUSIONS

In assessing the apparent change over
time from 1972 to 1984, we find that survey data suggests that greater uniformity and flexibility in eligibility criteria exists regarding vasectomy performance.
This phenomenon seems to be true for
both private physicians and family planning clinics, with the latter considerably
more flexible in service delivery.

a decreased demand for the operative
procedure throughout the United States
(AVS Factsheet). Perhaps the latter
trend has significantly influenced the
former, particularly with regard to requisite revenue generation in clinic settings. Nevertheless, a trend has evolved
which may well accelerate in the future.

As criteria have become less restrictive over the years, no groundswell of
untoward actions is evident in the literature. Medical sequelae and litigation
against practitioners apparently has not
escalated as eligibility criteria waned in
importance.

Perhaps the need for eligibility criteria for vasectomy performance has been
more imagined than real in the health
care system. An earlier perceived need
to practice defensive medicine apparently is giving way to more barrier-free
access to and performance of elective
vasectomy.
