Occupational Status and Reproductive Behavior in
Nineteenth-century Sweden: Locknevi Parish

It is a common observation that patterns of fertility and mortality, as
reflected by aggregate data, change
throughout time in concert with both
major historical events and more subtle
influences. Mortality and fertility rates
are lower now in Western developed
countries than in past eras. Declines in
fertility and mortality rates occurred at
identifiable periods as part of the “demographic transition,” and historical
correlates exist, but it is not clear how
the changes happened.

In some cases, the aggregate patterns
in fertility shifts we know as the demographic transition appear to be the result
of individual shifts in family planning as
a direct result of shifts in available resources (Eriksson and Rogers 1978,
Mosk 1983). However, aggregate-data
studies do not link individual family resources to individual family patterns.
Thus we do not know whether all individuals changed their reproductive patterns simultaneously, or whether the
changes occurred at different rates or
through different mechanisms among
various subgroups of the society. We
also do not know how the impacts of different familial strategies might differ for
families in different economic circumstances. The answers to these questions
wherever the requisite data exist could
clarify analysis of the demographic transition.

This paper analyzes the persistence
and increase/decrease of family lineages
in an agricultural Swedish parish during
the nineteenth century. Its purpose is to
analyze in detail patterns of fertility and
mortality before and during the demographic transition, using data on family
lineages for individuals of different occupations, in the parish of Locknevi,
Sweden, from 1824—96. It addresses the
following questions:

Did individuals of different occupational
status (a crude measure of access to resources) marry at different ages?

Did they evidence different rates of marital and total fertility?

Did they evidence different rates of
within-family mortality and survival?
Did they migrate out of the parish at different rates?

What was the net impact of these patterns
on the relative rates of increase of family
lines?

Were there sex differences in these patterns?

HYPOTHESES

Lockridge (1983) has argued persuasively that the fertility transition began
locally in Sweden earlier than is apparent from national data. There is evidence of family limitation behavior (late
marriage, low fertility rates) by the
1850’s in some areas. Eriksson and Rog

ers (1978) and Mosk (1983) have proposed that the changes were prompted
by family efforts to conserve resources,
such as land, which lose their value
when too finely divided. Intuitively, this
hypothesis seems reasonable. Nonsimultaneous changes in different geographic areas were correlated with settlement patterns and population density
(Lockridge, 1983). A careful reading of
Mosk’s (1983) analysis of fertility and
patrilineal inheritance suggests that individuals with more resources are likely
to pursue quite different reproductive
strategies than those with few resources,
and that when inheritance is sex-biased,
there may be different impacts on men’s
versus women’s reproductive lives.

The hypothesis that resource control
is effective in establishing and continuing family lines suggests that individuals
in the population will not all experience
the same costs and benefits under any
economic regime. Thus, individuals
with greater/lesser resources seem likely
to follow different strategies, or to be
differentially successful with similar
strategies. Further, the nature of the resource is important. Some resources,
such as herds of cattle, or money, can increase; others, such as land, do not increase and may lose all value when they
are sufficiently subdivided (nonpartible). Under these constraints, certain
predictions follow:

i. When the resource base is extensive, with limited pressure on it, and individuals can acquire plentiful resources, those individuals with large
amounts of resources should produce
more children than individuals with
fewer resources. This prediction will not
hold when (1) infant mortality rates are
uneven across classes, or (2) the role of
children is itself that of a resource, i.e.,
labor to acquire land (see Johansson,

Nineteenth-century Sweden 83

1987). However, in nineteenth-century
Sweden, access to health care was relatively egalitarian, and, while sons often
worked on a father’s farm, it is not clear
that their labor assisted parents in obtaining additional land above that used
for the sons themselves.

2. When a major (nonpartible) resource becomes limiting, family size
should decrease for resource-holding
families, and family size should become
more equal across the society. Thus, if
heritable resources are important to
children’s (especially sons’) eventual
success, as these resources become restricted, affected families seem likely to
restrict family size to ensure effectiveness of remaining resources.

3. For families with resources to bequeath, unequal distribution of resources among children may represent
an advantageous reproductive strategy.
Though this cannot be measured directly without examination of wills
(Smith et al., 1986), when unequal distribution occurs, unequal reproductive
performance should also be seen. Given
the legal constraints in Sweden, which
during the period of this study tended to
favor sons over daughters, and to favor
first-born sons, unequal reproduction in
this sample should be seen with parity
(birth order) in sons but not daughters.

4, When a major (nonpartible) resource becomes limiting, migration
rates should increase, and these rates
should differ for sons of different status
families (but not daughters), and for
sons of different parity within resourceholding families. Sons not inheriting resources may have a better chance to succeed by Jeaving the parish, rather than
remaining in their home parish. Thus,
resource-holding sons should remain,
using their resources to enhance their
lifetime success, as did their fathers,

while non-inheriting sons might best
practice “entrepreneurship” elsewhere.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Locknevi Parish, in Smaland, was a
relatively poor farming parish during
the period of this study. Most people
made their living through farming. A
small iron-works in the southwestern
part of the parish provided supplemental income for some farmers until the
1880's. The geography of the parish imposed constraints on farming (Gerger
and Hoppe, 1980). Only in the central
valley running from north to south were
there fields of sufficient fertility for
farming. At the beginning of the period
covered in this study, a few very large
land-holdings existed in Locknevi, controlled by a small number of individuals.
The amount of land under cultivation increased in the nineteenth century. However, much of the freeholders’ land was
subdivided so that landholdings became
progressively smaller, and some newly
cultivated holdings were in agriculturally marginal land. Thus, resource holdings shifted from being relatively uneven with some very large holdings to
being more even but with more restricted holdings.

Analyses were done to determine
whether resource control, as reflected
by occupational status, showed any correlation with the reproductive lives of
men and women in Locknevi. The effects of legitimacy and parity (birth order) were also examined, since these,
like occupational status, are likely to affect resource acquisition and control.

To follow the behavior of individuals
in different families requires information on the relatedness of individuals
through time. Data were obtained from
the Swedish Demographic Database,

Social Biology

Umea University, Umea, Sweden,
which contains computerized demographic and historical data derived from
Lutheran Church examination registers,
birth and baptismal registers, marriage
registers, migration registers, and
death/burial registers, for seven
nineteenth-century Swedish parishes
(Demographic Database, 1986). The
data were originally arranged to make it
easy for individuals to trace their family
lines as well as to construct aggregate
statistics. This arrangement makes it
possible to do longitudinal analysis and
is similar to that of the Ortissippenbuch
used by Knodel (1988).

In order to maximize the size and
continuity of lineage records and so that
fathers and sons could not appear in the
same record, the sample comprised all
men married between 1824 when records began and 1840 in Locknevi parish
(n=175), and all their descendants
(n=2,101) (Table 1). Descendents were
defined as those whose parenthood,
through baptismal or birth records,
could be reliably established. It is thus a
conservative estimate, since some records might be lost, and some fathers of
illegitimate children might not acknowledge them. Of the 2,101 descendants
born, 915 remained alive in the parish to
age 15 (484 males, 431 females), and 313
married (148 males, 165 females). Four
generations were represented.

For all individuals in the sample, the
following data were collected: sex; date
of birth; legitimacy status; parity (birth
order); father’s “‘best” occupation; age .
at first marriage; occupation at marriage; number of marriages; “best” occupation (for men) or spouse’s/father’s
“best” occupation (for married and unmarried women); number of. children
born; dates of children’s births and
deaths; date of death or loss of record;

and type of record loss (e.g., death or
migration out of the parish).
Occupations were clustered into five
categories from the approximately
10,000 occupational codes derived by
Erik Séderlund (Swedish Demographic
Database, Haparanda, Sweden): upper
middle class, those with several servants, ownership of factories or large
businesses, and/or large amounts of
land; lower middle class, small businessmen, artisans, professional soldiers,
with one or a very few servants; bénder,
farmers who owned their land; forpare,
those who farmed, had a long-term to
lifetime interest in the land, but could
not will it (cottars); statare, hired farm
laborers; and proletariat, household servants, retired servants, the indigent
poor. These categories approximate the
standard classification for upper and
lower middle class and farmers. For
most studies (e.g., Eriksson and Rogers, 1978; Brostrom et al., 1983), the
torpare are lumped in with household
servants and sfatare as proletariat. Because I was specifically interested in any
potential impacts of land use, I separated the torpare. For analysis, occupation was treated simply as a categorical

Nineteenth-century Sweden 85

variable, but to assign “best’’ occupation, the categories were assumed to be
ordinal. That is, if aman was a torpare at
one point in his life, and a bénder at another, his “‘best” occupation was given
as bonder. The designation “lower middie class” was the most variable in this
regard, as it encompassed a wide variety
of occupations and thus is likely to fail to
distinguish potentially large differences
in status and income.

Analyses included childhood and
adult survivorship and mortality, and
measures of fertility. Childhood measures were categorized by father’s occupation. Adults were defined as those individuals who survived past the age of 15
years, whether the categorization was
by father’s, own, or husband’s occupational status. Because the sample was
structured as an initial cohort of married
men and their descendants, intergenerational comparisons involving Generation 1 were restricted to married men.

The standard measure of age-specific
fertility summarizing the reproduction
of women in different age categories,
was calculated. Total Fertility Rate
(Palmore and Gardner, 1983), the sum
of all age-specific fertility, was also cal

culated. Because this measure is based
on mother’s age at the child’s birth, and
Generation 1 contained only men, it was
calculated for Generations 2—4.
Standard demographic measures are
designed to allow predictions about
populations. Because they are agegregate measures, they might vary depending on the relative representation of subgroups if subgroups behave differently,
and the strength of intergroup differences is difficult to assess because intragroup variance is not reflected. Since the
focus of this study is individual and familial patterns, new measures, built
from the individual and family patterns,
reflecting variance and allowing for the
testing of strength in intergroup differences, were used in addition to the
standard ones. In this study, I was able
to measure actual lifetime fertility
(NBC=number of biological children
born) for many individuals. In addition,
I was able to calculate for each individual the survivorship (Sj) and mortality
rates of their children to age ten, and the
resulting number of children alive at age
ten (RSjo). This measure, RSjo, is a “net
success” measure for each family, the
result of the interaction of other measures analyzed here: probability of marrying, age at marriage, age at birth of
first child, marital fertility rate, and
childhood survivorship. RSjo thus represents a summary measure reflecting the
probable net success of any family lineage as a function of the fertility and survivorship particular to that family. Both
NBC and RS} will tend to be somewhat
lower than aggregate measures such as
TFR, because some individuals die before completing their reproductive lifespans. The individual family measures
NBC and RSjp were restricted to those
adults living their lives within the parish.

 

Social Biology

Age-specific fertility and total fertility
rates do not require this restriction.
When people moved out of the parish, their records were truncated. To estimate net lifetime and multigenerational differences in patterns requires a
summary measure of patterns in occupational status and reproduction, one
that accounts for differences in record
loss. One such approach is the comparison of reproductive success per year of
reproductive life under observation.
The number of children born, or surviving to age ten, was divided by the number of years of reproductive life for
which records exist (age at death or record loss minus 15 for men; age at death/
record loss, or age 45, whichever was
less, minus 15 for women). This measure supplements the measures NBC
and RS; (which were restricted to those
individuals living their entire lives in the
parish). Obviously age-specific fertility
is important, since fertility diminishes as
age increases. However, because the
sample is structured so that individuals
enter through becoming married in the
first generation, and only through birth
in subsequent generations, and there is
no influx of mature individuals, any bias
in the relationship is consistent.
Statistical analyses were done using
the MIDAS and BMDP statistical packages on the Michigan Terminal System.
For analysis of marital and occupational
patterns, the sample was restricted to individuals surviving past age 15, in order
to separate the effects of childhood mortality from effects of occupational status. Analysis of variance was restricted
to problems (e.g., survivorship rate
within the family) for which data were
continuous and normally distributed
(Conover, 1980). Although ANOVA’s
are typically used for analysis of number
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

of children, the distribution is clearly
not normal (i.e., many more families
have one child than have the maximum
number), so the Kruskal-Wallis statistic
(Conover, 1980) was calculated.

RESULTS

The total fertility rate for Locknevi
parish, based on all women in the sample (thus excluding Generation 1) was
3,786 births per 1,000 women, which isa
median value for this period (Lockridge, 1983). The net fertility rate was
2,560, considerably lower. Different
patterns were apparent within this overall pattern, however, for men versus
women, and for individuals of different
categories.

MALE REPRODUCTIVE PATTERNS

Men’s survivorship did not vary with
occupational status (n=658, d.f.=3,
Mantel-Cox = 2.36, p=0.50). Approximately half of men living to maturity migrated from the parish (342/670, 51 per
cent). Men of different occupational statuses were not differentially likely to migrate out of the parish (see Migration,
below). It was not possible in this sample to track the lives of those migrating
out of the parish.

Nineteenth-century Sweden 87

Best occupation was associated with
differential likelihood of marrying for
males surviving to age 15 and entering
the period of potential reproduction
(Table 2; n=670, x°= 15.82, p=0.003)
(data only from generations 2-4, because of sample structure). Sixty-four
per cent of statare and proletarian men
failed to marry, compared to 34 per cent
of lower—middle-class men. In this society, marriage was important to lifetime
reproduction. Married men had significantly more (acknowledged) children
than unmarried men, and significantly
more children surviving to age ten
(NBC: n=532, KW=347.8, d.f.=1,

p=<0.00001. RSjo: n=532, KW=
214.5, d.f.=1, p<0.00001).

Sons of proletarian men tended to
marry earlier (x =22.0 years) than sons
of farmers (*x=27.5), torpare
(x=25.75), or lower—middle-class
(x= 26.4) men (ANOVA, n=211,
F=3.90, p=0.005). Men’s own occupation and age at marriage varied between
generations (Table 3 and below). The
age at which men first married was not
related to lifetime fertility in this sample, whether the analysis was done for
all men, or whether men of different occupational statuses were analyzed separately (RS,o: regression, 0.42<p<0.96).
No correlations were apparent between

p= 0.24. RS 40: n= 192, KW= 4.8,
p=0.34).

Remarriage was important to men’s
lifetime reproduction. Men who were
married more than once (n= 25; maximum number of marriages=4) had
more children (NBC: n=309,
KW=6.16, d.f.=1, p=0.01) and more
children surviving to age ten (RSjo:
n=309, KW=4.38, d.f.=1, p=0.04)
than men married only once. Most
likely to marry more than once were forpare (9/79, 10.2 per cent) and upper—
middle-class men (1/4, 25 per cent).

A number of reproductive patterns
changed significantly between the first
generation in the sample (ancestral cohort) and all subsequent generations.
Men in the ancestral cohort, married between 1824-40, married at a slightly
older age (28.7 + 9.1) than their male
descendants (27.3 + 4.9; d.f.=330,
F=2.63, p=0.11), if all classes are

lumped. Class differences in age at marriage existed in the descendant generations while no class differences were evident in Generation 1 (Table 3). Torpare
and statare/proletariat men married earlier in the descendant generations than
in the initial cohort. Class differences in
number of fertile years existed in the
first years, but not in subsequent ones
(Table 4).

Family size decreased over the study
period (Table 5, Fig. 1). Thus, marital
fertility was reduced by the 1860’s in
Locknevi. In 1841-50, few couples married, and these couples had few children. It is important to note that this
decade was a period of hard climatic
conditions (Utterstrém, 1957, H, pp.
442-443), with several seasons having
significant crop failures, followed by
harsh winters.

In Generation 1, both the number of
children born during a man’s lifetime
and the number of those children surviving to age ten varied significantly with a

man’s best occupational status. Both decreased with status. In Generations 2
and 3, NBC varied nonlinearly, and
RSjo Showed only a nonsignificant trend
(Fig. 2, Table 5). Survivorship within
the family also varied with occupational
status in the first generation (though the
relationship was only marginally significant), but not in Generations 2-4 (Table 6). The within-family survivorship
was lowest for statare/proletariat families in Generation 1, but increased in
Generations 2—4 (Table 6). No married
upper—middle-class men remained in
the sample in Generation 2. Fertility fell
for lower—middle-class men; statare/
proletariat fertility remained low (Fig.
2, Table 5).

In terms of the increase or decrease
of lineages, not only the total number of
children produced is important, but also
whether those children are produced
early or late in the parents’ lives. Children produced early in life will bear
grandchildren earlier than those born
later (Fisher, 1930), and if lineages consistently reproduce earlier than others,
they have a more rapid rate of increase
(m=r, Fisher, 1930). When the reproductive rates NBC/year and RSjo/year
are calculated, an interesting summary
pattern emerges. In the first generation,
there was no difference with class in the

Social Biology

number of children produced per year,
but the impacts of the other influences
discussed here result in a significant linear pattern. Married men of higher occupational status had, per year of records during reproductive life, more
children surviving to age ten (Fig. 2, Table 7). In Generations 2-4, the pattern
was reversed. A significant difference
existed in the number of children born
per year of records during reproductive
life, but not in the number of surviving
to age ten (Table 7).

FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE PATTERNS

Sixty-one per cent (262/430) of the
women surviving past age 15 in this sample failed to marry while in the parish.
Women’s age at marriage and agespecific fertility is summarized in Figure
3 (also see Sex Differences, below).
Some form of family limitation behavior
is evident from Fig. 3. Women’s agespecific fertility peaks much later than
their age at marriage.

No pattern was apparent in women’s
likelihood of marriage and father’s occupational status (n=425, y?=4.40,
p=0.36). Women who married earlier
were somewhat more likely to have
more children than those who married
later (regression: n=144, r=0.18,

F=4.66, p=0.03). Women’s age at
marriage did not differ with occupational status of either father (ANOVA:
n=163, F=0.44, p=0.78) or husband
(ANOVA: n=164, F=1.30, p=0.28).
Further, women’s lifetime production of
children and number of children alive at
age ten were not related to their father’s
occupation (NBC: n=182, KW=3.63,
d.f.=4, p=0.46. RSig: n=182,
KW=4.06, d.f.=4, p=0.21) or their

KW=1.71, d.f.=4, p=0.79. RSyo:
n=142, KW=193, d.f.=4, p=0.75).
Only 4 women in the sample married
more than once. The number of marriages did not appear to influence a
woman’s lifetime fertility (1=146,
KW=1.15,d.f.=1, p=0.28) or number
of children surviving to age ten (RSjo:
n=146, KW=0.41, d.f.=1, p=0.52).

 

Social Biology

It is possible that women married to
men of different occupations, while having no net differences in total lifetime reproduction, nonetheless produced children at different rates, and showed
mortality schedules that differed. When
women’s rates of reproduction were analyzed by husband’s occupational status, no patterns were apparent in NBC/
year (n=143, KW=0.74, p=0.95) or
RS}p/year (n= 143, KW =2.6, p=0.62).
The survivorship of women married to
men of different occupational status also
did not differ (= 419, Wilcoxin =3.98,
d.f.=3, p=0.26; Savage =3.06,
d.f.=3, p=0.38).

For all the measures computed, then,
differences in the resources controlled
by the fathers and husbands of women
in this sample did not directly influence
women’s reproductive patterns.

PARITY

Farmers (bénder), upper—middleclass, and lower~middle-class men had
the potential to accumulate heritable resources (e.g., land and money) to a
greater degree than torpare, statare, and
proletarian men. The larger the family
size, the more constrained is the distribution of these resources, and in many
societies, preference is given to earlierborn children. In this sample, there
were too few upper—middle-class families to analyze (3 men in the initial cohort fathered 26 children, 3 of whom
died and 8 of whom moved from the parish before reproductive age; another 6
moved before age 32). For the other
resource-acquiring occupational categories, parity (birth order) was significantly correlated with reproductive behavior for men (Hypothesis 3).
Earlier-born men were more likely to
marry (n=344, x?=13.1, p=0.004),
and married men, as shown above, had
far greater fertility than unmarried men.
Earlier-born men had more children
than later-born sons, This pattern was

Nineteenth-century Sweden 93

not true for sons of torpare, statare, and
proletariat, who had no land, and probably smaller monetary resources (Table
8). Women’s parity showed no pattern
with their reproductive lives (Hypothesis 3).

MIGRATION

Of the 484 men and 431 women in
Generations 2—4 who lived in the parish
until at least 14 years old, 257 men and
269 women migrated out of the parish.
Men of different occupations were not
differentially likely to migrate
(n=1,015, x?=7.4, d.f.=4, p=0.12);
the pet cent migrating ranged from 40.8
per cent (bdnder) to 64.3 per cent (9/14,
upper middle class). If the upper middle
class is excluded from analysis, the class
migrating most frequently is the lower
middle class (48.8 per cent).

Women who lived in the parish until
age 14 showed a marginally significant
tendency to leave the parish depending
on their father’s occupation (n=425,
x? = 8.21, p =0.08, 0/=0.14); daughters
of bénder were somewhat less likely to

leave (57.2 per cent) than daughters of
lower middle class men (63.3 per cent),
torpare (69.4 per cent), and statare/
proletariat (69.7 per cent).

While men’s occupational status had
no effect on likelihood of migration out
of the parish, parity was important.
Earlier-born men (first or second born)
were more likely to stay in the parish (59
per cent) than men who were third or
fourth born (51.7 per cent), or laterborn (33.6 per cent) (7=549, d.f.=2,
xX? =22.35, p=0.00001). For women,
parity made no difference in probability
of migrating (n= 427, d.f.=2, x?=3.09,
p=0.21). Thus Hypothesis 4 was supported.

For women, unmarried fertility appeared to be related to likelihood of outmigration. Married women were
equally likely to stay in the parish
whether they had children or not; unmarried women with children were
more likely to leave the parish than married women or unmarried women without children (n= 162, d.f.=1, x?=4.0,
p=0.05).

LEGITIMACY

The parish records track the legitimacy status of all individuals born. The
illegitimacy rate was low in this sample.
Forty of 1,799 births (2.2 per cent) were
recorded as illegitimate (33) or occurring during betrothal (7) of the parents.
Most of these births were first children
of unmarried women who then had further children (n=33), although not all
of these were born during the betrothal
period. For nine of the 40 births, the father’s occupation was recorded. Of the
33 illegitimate children, three were fathered by men whose best occupation
was statare/proletariat; 30 illegitimate
children had no paternity assigned. Of

 

Social Biology

the 7 births during the betrothal period,
four had fathers who were statare/
proletariat, one had a torpare father,
and one had a farmer father (one
=unknown). Either higher-status men
produced no illegitimate children, or the
likelihood of men acknowledging paternity was strongly associated with their
occupational status (n=1,718,
x?= 39.81, p=0.00001, G-K Gamma= 0.86, se=0.10).

Illegitimacy had important impacts.
Only about half of the illegitimate children born survived to age ten
(x=0.52 + 0.45), compared to threefourths of children born within marriages (x=0.76 + 0.31) and the difference is significant (ANOVA, F= 10.06,
p=0.002). Only three illegitimate individuals remained in the sample to maturity. However, these three did not appear to be at a _ reproductive
disadvantage in terms of numbers of
children produced.

Sex DIFFERENCES

Women married earlier than men
(X;=23.6 years, Xm=28.1, t=7.02,
p=0.00001, d.f.= 494), and this difference was evident for individuals of all
different occupations. A greater percentage of women lived their entire lives
in the parish without marrying or producing children than did men (nm = 1,101,
x?= 13.10, p=0.003). Women were
mor likely to leave the parish than men
(62.9 per cent versus 49 per cent;
n=1,101, x?=20.5, p=0.00001).

Men were somewhat more likely to
remarry than were women; 7.6 per cent
(26/344) of adult men married more
than once (from 2-4 times), while 2.1
per cent (4/194) of women married
twice. No woman in the sample married
more than twice.

In societies in which men remarry

more often than women, it is typical for
men’s reproductive lives to vary more
than women’s. That is, more men than
women fail to marry and have children,
and the most prolific men have far more
children than the most prolific women
(Bateman, 1948; Alexander, 1979; review by Low, 1988). In this sample,
however, the variance in men’s production of children born, and surviving to
age ten, was not significantly greater
than the variance for women (Table 9);
in fact, because more women than men
who remained in the sample failed to
marry, the reproductive variance
tended to be slightly, although not significantly, higher for women. A significant

TABLE 9

95

difference in reproductive rate, and variance in reproductive rate, was apparent
between the sexes (Table 9). Women
produced more children per year during
their (shorter) reproductive years than
did men, and the variance in women’s
RSjo/year exceeded that for men.
Typically, sex differences exist in survivorship of children. Male mortality exceeds female mortality in the early years
(Alexander, 1974). Biologically, this is
an expected pattern. When one sex (in
humans, males) requires more energy
expenditure (e.g., is carried in utero
longer, nurses more, and more frequently), that sex typically has a lower
survivorship during dependency. However, familial valuation of sons versus
daughters might influence this pattern
(Hammel et al., 1983; Johansson, 1984).

Breslow=0.11, p=0.79 Savage/
Mantel-Cox = 8.08, p=0.79). This lack
of the expected bias toward higher female survivorship may represent a mild
case of the situation Johansson (1984)
described. Comparison of age of death,
considering only those individuals
whose entire life was spent in the parish
(so that age at death is known exactly),
of sons versus daughters by father’s occupation, shows that sons of farmers and
torpare (land-based occupations) live
significantly longer than daughters (Table 10). No differences in age of death of
sons and daughters are apparent for any
other occupations.

SOCIAL AND MARITAL MOBILITY

Men’s occupations were strongly
linked to those of their fathers (m = 542,
x? = 918.40, p = 0.00001). Thus, with the
occupational categories used, little social mobility was apparent. There appeared to be reproductive consequences
associated with occupational mobility
for men. Men who moved “up” were
likelier than predicted to have fewer
than the median number of children,
and fewer than the median number of
children surviving to age ten (NBC:
n=542, x?=10.0, p=0.04. RSjo:
n=542, x?=19.1, p=0.0008). Whether
this finding represents a conflict between effort required to accumulate resources versus that available to invest in
offspring, or whether men who moved
up followed a strategy of concentrating
resources in fewer children is not clear
from this sample.

Women tended to marry men of the
same occupational status as their fathers
(n= 162, x?= 187.4, p=0.0001). Using
the occupational categories described
above, we find 41 of 162 women married

Social Biology

“up” or “down.” In some societies,
marrying up (hypergyny) results in increased fertility (e.g., Dickemann,
1979). In this sample, marrying up or
down appeared to have no reproductive
impact for women (NBC: n= 162,

x7=1.8, p=0.76. RS 10: n=162,
x7=0.9, p=0.91).
DISCUSSION

This paper examined the effects of
status, as reflected by occupation, on
marriage, fertility, and survival of children in Locknevi Parish, Sweden. In the
first generation (men married 1824-40),
greater differences in the range of occupations existed than in subsequent generations. Men’s reproductive patterns
varied in concert with their occupational
status. Little occupational mobility was
apparent for men. This would suggest,
other things being equal, that the reproductive differentials would accumulate
over time. However, by the second generation in the sample, during the period
of apparent resource constriction in
Locknevi Parish as land became scarcer
and parcels became smaller (Gerger and
Hoppe, 1980), reproductive differentials associated with occupation disappeared. Family size and rate of production of children decreased during this
period as well. Hypotheses 1 and 2 were
thus supported.

As Knodel (1986) has pointed out,
the classic demographic transition
model gives central importance to correlations in fertility and mortality. The
question is whether fertility decline occurs in the context of mortality decline/
survivorship increase (Livi-Bacci,
1986). In this study, overall survivorship
of infants and children up to age ten actually decreased slightly from Generation 1 to Generation 2, while fertility

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

also decreased. Further, survivorship
increased markedly among children of
proletariat, whose fertility did not decrease, while both fertility and survivorship decreased among the lower middle
class (Tables 5, 6). The sample sizes in
this study are small, but the results suggest that breaking down samples appropriately may shed light on the actual relationship at the micro level.

Livi-Bacci (1986) and others have
found that fertility declines are typically
led by households of prominent of highstatus individuals. In this study, highstatus individuals had larger families in
the first generation (although the sample size is small), and in the second generation, family sizes were more even
across occupational status. Further,
while migration probability shows no
significant statistical pattern with occupation for adults of either sex, children
of the three upper-middle-class men in
the initial cohort had mostly (11/13) left
the parish by the time they were age 20,
and before marriage. This outmigration coincided with the breaking
up of land parcels into more numerous
parcels of smaller size. Lesthaeghe and
Wilson (1986) proposed that economic
factors influence fertility shifts. Though
they restricted their argument to considerations of mode of production (.e.,
labor-intensive farm production), their
argument may be extended to the question of resource level and type.

In Locknevi the pattern is consistent
with Lockridge’s (1983) suggestion that
the fertility transition occurred earlier
than previously supposed in Sweden. In
Locknevi, it appears to have occurred as
the result of elimination of reproductive
differences previously associated with
differences in resources (Lesthaeghe
and Wilson, 1986). Lockridge (1983), in
analyzing fertility in 1805, 1855, and

Nineteenth-century Sweden

97

1889-90 for various parishes, found that
the fertility transition was not necessarily a permanent shift. In some
parishes—the ones with richer
resources—fertility rose after a temporary decrease. His results imply that,
while culture is the obvious mediator of
changes in fertility patterns, the changes
are likely to be related, as this study suggests, to resource availability.

Although occupational correlations
with reproduction disappeared after the
first generation in this study, differences
associated with parity remained. If resources are important in raising children
successfully, parents face the problem of
optimum allocation of resources among
their offspring. It would not be surprising to find unequal distribution of resources among children following differences in sex and birth order (Hypothesis
3). I could not measure the actual distnbution of resources in this sample, since
I did not have access to the wills of individuals. It is of interest, however, that
from 1686 to 1809/10 in Sweden a legally
recognized practice existed among the
nobility termed “fideicommiss”’: passing
all land and goods only to the eldest son
(Inger, 1980; Malmstrom, 1981). Certain restrictions applied; for example,
the heir was bound by law to continue
the practice of fideicommiss. In 1809,
the formation of new fideicommiss was
forbidden, but parity-biased inheritance
was not (Inger, 1980; Malmstrom,
1981).

Until 1845, sons inherited twice as
much as daughters in rural areas of Sweden (Lo-Johannsson, 1981; Inger,
1980). In 1845, sons and daughters were
granted equal inheritance rights, but
certain restrictions applied. Sons had
first choice of the land and goods that
were to be their inheritance, and sons
were given the right to buy their sisters’

98 Low

inheritance from them (Inger, 1980).
Thus, sons received relatively more resources directly from fathers than did
daughters. Daughters received fewer resources from their fathers, but could
gain access to resources from their husbands. The fact that women’s lifetime
fertility and number of children surviving to age ten showed no major patterns
with either father’s or husband’s occupational status is therefore of interest.

If the initial cohort had been structured to include women, patterns of reproduction with husband’s status would
have been apparent for women in the
first generation. However, since men remarried more than women, and had
more children in second and subsequent
marriages than did women, the pattern
is unlikely to have been as strong as the
pattern reported here for men. The lifetime fertility of women is more limited
biologically than that of men. Even the
wealthiest women are constrained by
menopause and the physiological costs
of pregnancy and lactation. Attempts to
change those costs, for example, by employing wet nurses, do not appear to
have had a generally net positive effect
on lifetime reproduction.

Lesthaeghe and Wilson (1986) have
suggested, on the basis of a thorough
analysis of the correlates of fertility in
nineteenth-century Europe, that secularization of attitudes is a necessary and
sometimes sufficient trigger to fertility
decline. Lesthaeghe and Wilson noted
that simple correlations between aggregate fertility measures and broad measures of resources are weak. Secularization seems a likely concomitant of
changes in fertility, and the hypothesis is
consistent with changes occurring first in
the upper and lower ends of any occupational scale.

It is important, though, that broad

 

Social Biology

measures of resources do not adequately reflect the resource/fertility decisions of individuals. I would argue that
while secularization of attitudes may be
an important proximate trigger to
changes in fertility (Williams, 1966),
only measures that treat the variation in
both resource control and fertility across
populations will answer whether constriction of resources is a necessary correlate of fertility decline. The results of
this study suggest that when resource
differentials are great, men can use
them to increase their lifetime fertility to
a much greater extent than can women.
When resources become constricted, reproductive differentials are likely to disappear.

Cross-culturally, a pattern is apparent of men using resources to gain reproductively, although in many societies
men’s increase in reproductive success Is
accomplished through polygyny—
additional wives. Betzig’s (1986) work
shows clearly that in a number of socteties, there are clear, formal, reproductive rewards associated with status.
High-ranking men have the right to
more wives, and have significantly more
children than others. In 10 of 12 societies reviewed by Hill (1984), resource
control enhanced reproductive success.
In some societies the relationship was
quite straightforward. In the Turkmen,
Irons (1979a,b) found that richer men
had more wives and more children than
poorer men. Borgerhoff Mulder (1988)
found that in the African Kipsigis, richer
men married younger wives and produced more children than poorer men,
although with the introduction of Western technology and medicine, differentials were reduced. Even in societies
such as the Yanomamo, in which few
physical resources are owned, male kin
available for coalitions represent a re

source. Men manipulate kinship terms
in ways that make more women available for mates and more powerful men as
partners (Chagnon, 1982), so that reproductive success is uneven.

Even in monogamous societies, monogamy may be far from absolute.
Among the Kalahari Bushmen, living in
a resource-limited environment, 5 per
cent of the men, the best hunters, manage to have two wives (Lee, 1979). In
Western technological monogamous societies today, including Sweden and the
United States, remarriage and secondfamily formation may be sex-biased
(men remarry more than women, and
have children in second marriages more

- than do women). When this occurs, the

society is rendered effectively polygynous (Essock-Vitale, 1984; Daly and
Wilson, 1983; Hartung, 1983). Vining
(1986) has argued that these trends
(richer men reproducing more than
poorer men) are spurious. He and others (e.g., Wrong, 1980, 1985) argue that
we do not know why wealth and status
differentials with reproduction exist
during periods of population expansion,
and why they seem to disappear when
population growth stops.

The results of this study are suggestive. Nineteenth-century Sweden represents an extreme in the spectrum of societal constraints on people’s reproductive behavior. It was highly monogamous, with a relatively low rate of
remarriage, essentially no divorce, and
a low rate of illegitimacy. Even in this
society, when resource differentials existed, men appear to have used these differences to enhance their reproductive
success. As resources became limited,
wealthier families moved out or restricted their family size, and land holdings became smaller. Reproductive differences were eliminated. In a broader

study of Swedish fertility, Lockridge
(1983) found that in some areas, such as
Asunda, fertility shifts appeared to be
linked to resource conditions, while in
other areas, such as Hedemora, the fertility transition occurred with no evidence of resource constriction, although
no detailed analysis of resource availability was undertaken. Shorter (1975),
Hughes (1986), Smith (1977), and Stone
(1977) all found patterns related to resource level in societies entering the demographic transition, as did Razi (1980)
for medieval England.

Fertility shifts in humans typically involve deliberate choice about reproductive matters, and thus changes are possible in the absence of resource shifts that
would be correlated for other species. In
this study it is clear that deliberate
choice was involved, since not only net
reproduction decreased, but the rate of
reproduction decreased, and women’s
age-specific fertility peaked much later
than expected from their marriage patterns. Freedman and Thornton (1982)
have shown that in the United States,
families make deliberate decisions
about family size in response to their
judgment of available resources, and
that, when deliberately chosen family
sizes are considered, there is a correlation between income and family size.
When accidental pregnancies are considered, the picture becomes less clear.

Perhaps the underlying correlation ts
simply that population growth is likely
as an outgrowth of individual reproductive decisions when resources are abundant, and thus population stasis or decline is likely to be tied to conditions of
constricted resources. However, this argument is complicated by several modifiers. It should only hold true when parental care has been able to combat
infant mortality. In Third World coun

tries in which infant mortality has always
been beyond parental care impacts, but
new medical technology lowers infant
and child mortality, we should still see a
rapid fertility rise with the introduction
of medicine. Further, cultural mores
and shifts in cultural values can cause
shifts even if no ecological or resource
correlates exist, either because of broad
shifts in cultural values (Knodel, 1988;
Lockridge, 1983), or because children
specifically are seen as more or less valuable to parents in an economic sense
(Johansson, 1987). Handwerker (1986)
has argued that micro- and macro- patterns need to be reexamined. His general argument is largely correct, but I
would argue that considering the ecological impacts of resource availability
may give us clearer leads to the direction
of causality in fertility shifts.
