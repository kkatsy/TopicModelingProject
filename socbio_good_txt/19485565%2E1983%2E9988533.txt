ABSTRACT: Interviews were held with a stratified random sample of heads of households (and/
or their spouses) in metropolitan Madras to obtain information on social class identification,
height and weight of self and spouse, and other socioeconomic characteristics of the household
and of the parents. Social class is found to be weakly but positively correlated with height and
ponderal index and is found to be moderately but positively correlated with weight, with age
held constant. The social class differences are related to variations among them in ethnic and
biological inheritance, the wholesomeness of the household (nutrition, sanitation, and health
care), and the value placed on kinds of foodstuffs.

A correlation between social class or
socioeconomic status and the height and
weight of children and adults in various
countries has been well documented in
the literature for nearly a century (Bennett et al., 1975, pp. 171-172). Some
quantitative data are in several studies
published in Great Britain in the latter
part of the nineteenth century. The most
extensive is the study of Charles Roberts, which is a report of the British Association, 1883, titled Anthropometric
Survey of British Isles. Like other
studies of this period, it finds a positive
association between social class, as measured by occupational status, and the
height and weight of men; for example,
the professional classes are about one
inch taller and about twenty pounds
heavier, on the average, than the factory
operatives, with age constant for the two
classes (Goring, 1972 pp. 193, 195).

These early findings are confirmed by
studies done in the twentieth century.
Most of these studies pertain to children
and infants. Krogman (1972, pp. 142143) cities older studies in Germany,
Scotland, Switzerland, and the United

States which find a positive correlation
between social class and stature and
young age at maturation. However, he
cautions the reader against readily accepting findings of studies which do not
control for family size. The reason is
that “the larger the family, the slower
the growth-rate. This is evident by the
sixth grade and continues thereafter, so
that the adolescent growth spurt (betokening a maturation level) is also delayed” (Krogman 1972, p. 143). A review of fifteen studies between 1941 and
1959 concludes that “children from different socio-economic levels differ in average body size at all ages that have been
investigated, the upper groups being always more advanced along the course to
maturity” (Tanner 1962, p. 137-141).
Data for Scotland show that these class
differences hold for each size of family
(varying from one to five siblings) com
pared (Tanner 1962, p. 138). A recen
study of school-children in Texas finds
children of middle-income families surpass children of low-income families in
height, weight, lean body mass, and total body fat, at most specific ages from

10 to 18 years (Schutte 1980). On the
other hand; a study in Sweden finds the
correlation between parents’ income
and the height and weight of children to
be virtually nil, but does find a strong
positive correlation between father’s occupation and the size of these children
(Tanner 1962, p. 140). The opinion of
most researchers is that childhood differences persist into adulthood. Tanner
(1962, p. 96, 97) cites three studies
which follow children to adulthood and
find differences in physique still persisting and cites nine studies which show
that ‘“‘early maturers are not only people
whose growth to maturity is advanced at
all ages; they are also people who as
adults have more weight-for-height than
late maturers.”” On the other hand, a
study in Philadelphia (the Fels data),
while not providing information on

_ adult weight, finds that as adults early

maturers are not taller than late maturers (Tanner 1962, p. 101).

Studies of adults usually find a positive correlation between social class and
height and weight. This correlation
holds for Scotland and other places,
studied more than two decades ago, but
in some instances “‘the higher classes [although taller and heavier] have less
weight for height than the lower ones
and are therefore more linear, or ectomorphic” (Tanner 1962, p. 140). A recent study of Italian migrants to Belgium provides a mixed picture of how
two aspects of socioeconomic status—
education and occupation—are related
to adult body size. While education correlates significantly and positively with
height and weight, occupation correlates significantly and positively with
only height (Susanne, 1979, p. 350).
This correlation between education and
size also appears in a study of a very homogeneous population—all males of

Belgian origin, aged 19 to 26 years, who
were liable to military service in 1958,
1969, and 1970 (N=103, 501). In this
study, while level of schooling, father’s
occupation, age, birth order, and number of siblings are all correlated with
height and weight, partial correlations
reveal education to be the strongest single correlate (Susanne, 1980, p. 703).
The most precisely stated measurement
of how height is related to three socioeconomic variables—habitation,
occupational-educational status of the
father, and number of siblings—is found
in a study of 12,711 Polish conscripts
born in 1957 and examined in 1976. It
finds that mean height decreases monotonically with decreasing degree of urbanization, decreasing occupationaleducational status of the father, and
increasing sibship size. Of these factors,
occupational-educational status of the
father has the strongest effect on height,
and all three factors combined account
for only 6.5 per cent of the total variation of body height (Bielicki et al. 1981,
pp. 545, 548).

The reasons why social class, or socioeconomic status, correlates with the
height and weight of children and adults
have yet to be established with any degree of precision. In the opinion of Tanner (1962, p. 140), ‘““The causes of the
socio-economic differential are probably multiple. . . . Nutrition is almost
certainly one, and with it all the habits of
regular meals, sleep, exercise and general organization that distinguish, from
this point of view, a good home from a
bad one.” While nutrition is the factor
most often linked by researchers to variations in human size, its influence has
usually been measured in an indirect
rather than a direct way. Since the pioneering study of Boas in 1911, over a
dozen researchers have compared the

Vol. 30, No. 2

height and weight of migrants, or their
progeny, in the country of arrival with
the height and weight of their parents or
peers in the country of origin and have
attributed the superior size of the
former to better nutrition and living
conditions in the country of arrival.

More direct measurement of how
size is related to one or the other
variable—nutrition or socioeconomic
status—is found in two studies. Frisch
and Revelle (1967 and 1969), by their
comparisons of eight nations of Latin
America and eight nations of Asia, find
that rates of body growth and size at maturity, for females and males, within
each group of nations, are highly correlated with calorie supply. The other report (Bielicki et al., 1981, pp. 550, 551)
cites governmental surveys in Poland
which find a positive correlation between per capita income in the household and “the annual per capita consumption of food items which are
principal sources of animal protein, calclum and vitamins, i.e., of nutrients
most essential for growth.” While Frisch
and Revelle do not link socioeconomic
status to calorie intake and physical size,
they do assume that such linkage exists
(Frisch and Revelle, 1967, pp. 10, 11).
And, while Bielicki and associates do
not link physical size to income and calorie intake, they are of the opinion that
the linkage is not especially strong because of the slight correlation between
education and size which they discover
(as noted above) and because of the independence between education or occupation and income which they believe to
exist in Poland (Bielicki et al. 1981, p.
550).

Studies of infants and children point
to the role of nutrition in growth and
physical size. The Fels study (Tanner
1962, p. 101) relates the degrees of fat
Social Class and Height and Weight

191

ness in boys and girls to the calories
taken in and finds “‘that the higher the
calorie intake the faster the maturational rate.”” An anthropometric survey
in 1979 of infants and children (0 to 5
years of age) in Belize shows that
protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and
growth retardation (stunting and wasting) correlate directly with inadequate
diet, illness (the frequency of diarrhea),
increasing age, and lower socioeconomic status (as measured by the number of siblings in the household)
(Jenkins, 1981).

The correlation between social class
and height and weight might also be due
to constitutional or genetic factors, but
the precise way in which these three factors interact with one another has yet to
be determined. Stature is known to be a
highly heritable trait as shown by studies
of twins and siblings (Bennett et al.,
1975, p. 171) and by the prevalence of
sexual dimorphism in stature in all human Societies which have been studied
(Bennett, 1975, pp. 170, 171; Gray and
Wolf, 1980, pp. 442, 455). It seems that
social class could correlate with the genetic components in human stature and
weight under two conditions. One con- dition is the instance where social class
and physical size, for males or females,
are correlated, and because of highly endogamous marriages the progeny of
such marriages inherit the stature and
bone structure of their parents. Under
this condition the correlation would
continue only if intergenerational mobility in social class is slight. The other
condition, which may manifest itself in
one generation or over generations, is
where social classes are differentiated
by the ethnic/racial groups which comprise them (Frisch and Revelle, 1967,
pp. 10, 11).

The correlation between social class

192

and stature has given rise to studies of
assortative mating but in a manner
much too limited to demonstrate all aspects of condition one, above. Such
studies have sought merely to determine
whether or not height influences spousal
selection. An assessment of several
studies concludes: ‘“The results of homogamy for stature have been inconsistent. However, these studies basically
confirmed the earlier studies by Galton
and Pearson in which homogamy for
stature was found, but it differed by socioeconomic groups. The importance of
stature in mate selection depends on the
bases for the marriage contract” (Bennett et al., 1975, pp. 172, 173). A more
recent and greatly extended study compares the parents of black and white
children in terms of assortative mating
for stature, weight, and the ponderal
and Quetelet indices and finds assortative mating to be more prevalent among
white than among black parents. In this
study the whites are mainly middle class,
and the blacks are primarily lower class,
according to the estimates of the researches (Mueller and Malina, 1976, p.
296).

The second condition where social
class differences in height or weight
could be attributed to the genetic component, i.e., when social classes are segregated on the basis of ethnic/racial
groups, has not been carefully studied
either. However, there are studies
which combine social class and
ethnicity/race as a factor but mention
only one of the two components when
analyzing how the combination correlates with height or weight. The researcher sometimes recognizes that the
correlation obtained is due to the neglected component, as when Mueller
and Malina (1976, p. 274) say that the
different degrees of assortative mating

Driver and Driver

Social Biology

for stature in blacks and whites may
reflect differences in the economic class
of blacks and whites. More typically, the
possible contribution of the neglected
component is not recognized, and the
researcher expresses surprise or, more
strongly, puzzlement about the obtained correlation. The result is illustrated by some studies cited in Tanner
(1962, p. 107). Ito’s 1942 study of women
at a Los Angeles college notes the absence of an expected correlation between maturation (as measured by the
age of menarche) and the nutritional
and economic status of five ethnic/racial
groups (Blacks, Chinese, Japanese,
Mexicans, and whites or Europeans);
and Kraus’s 1954 comparison of NativeAmericans with Whites and Roberts’
1960 comparison of Nilotic Blacks with
Whites, both resident in the Sudan, unexpectedly find Whites to be less in
height and weight while enjoying more
favorable economic circumstances and
presumably, better nutrition. Of course,
the failure to account for the possible
contribution of the neglected component will sometimes result in the expected conclusion. This fact is illustrated by two recent studies which find
the secular trend in growth of MexicanAmericans to be about one-third less
than the rates for Whites (USA and Europe) and attribute this lower rate to the
“matrix of lower socio-economic conditions, poorer health conditions, and the
marginal nutritional status of Mexican
Americans” (Malina and Zavaleta 1980,
p. 453; Zavaleta and Malina 1982).
There remains, then, the need to ascertain the relative contributions of genetical and nutritional and other environmental factors to social class
variations in body size. In the words of
Tanner (1962, p. 120), “Obviously the
height of an actual child . . . represents
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

 

 

Vol. 30, No. 2

the resultant of both genetical and environmental forces, together with their interaction, which may be of multiplicative kind. .. . It is exceedingly difficult
at present to specify quantitatively the
relative importance of each factor.”
Tanner (1962, p. 121) goes on to remark
on the study of Quade in 1956 which attempts to disentangle the relative importance of parents’ income and pari, ents’ height on height of Copenhagen
= schoolchildren:

He showed the partial correlation of children’s height on parents’ height for given
income was greater than that on parents’
income for given parents’ height, thought
this latter was statistically significant.
Somewhat arbitrary estimates of the relative correlations were 0.3 for heights
within income groups and 0.1 for child’s
height and parental income within parental height groups.

However, parents’ height and income are themselves positively correlated (0.13). Similarly, Frisancho and associates examine the relationships
between the physique and nutritional
Status of mothers and the prenatal
growth of their neonates. After classifying these 4,952 Peruvian mothers into
age-specific percentiles, they find that:
maternal height correlates with prenatal
growth’’; “differences in maternal] stature appear to have minimal influence on
birth weight and recumbent length
where maternal protein and calorie reserves are held constant’; and variations in maternal protein reserves (muscles) are more correlated, and in a
positive fashion, with linear growth than
are variations in calorie reserves (fat)
(Frisancho et al. 1977, pp. 264, 273).

The relationship of social class, or socioeconomic status, to human growth

and physical size in India has been studied occasionally, and the findings are
similar to those of studies done elsewhere. There is a positive correlation
between social class and the birth weight
of the newborn (Mukherjee and Biswas,
1959, p. 395) and the early age of maturation of girls, as indicated by the onset
of menarche (Israel, 1959, p. 314). In
two other studies, social class is not measured but is said or implied to bear on
the findings. A recent study of male college students finds those resident in the
urban area to be taller and heavier than
their counterparts in the rural area
(Bandyopadhyay and Chattopadhyay,
1981, p. 120, 121). Women and their
progeny residing in London after migrating from the Punjab are found to be
taller and heavier than their counterparts still resident in a specific district of
the Punjab, with age held constant (Keil
et al., 1980, p. 424-28.)

Our study is intended to extend research on social class and height and
weight in India and elsewhere. It compares social classes resident in a large urban area, metropolitan Madras, in
terms of height, weight, and ponderal
index. Men and women are separately
compared with age controlled because
there is evidence of changing physical
size with increasing age.!

IStudies of the effect of aging on stature and
weight do not reach identica] conclusions. Anthropometric measurements of adults in Ireland reveal
that stature for men increases until about age 30
and then decreases. Stature for women begins to
decrease slightly before age 30, but the trend ts less
regular than it is for men. These findings and those
of other published reports do not agree, say the researchers: “while several studies have shown aging
effects to be more pronounced for males . . . others have shown females to be more responsive to
the aging process” (Relethford and Lees, 1981, 81,
82, 85). A study of adult stature in Colombia,
which uses age categories different from those
used in the Ireland study, says that after correcting
for the secular change in adult stature, “the esti

Attention is also given to the possible
influence of genetic and environmental
factors on correlations between social
class and physical size, but unfortunately the nature of our data does not
permit the kind of systematic analysis
this topic requires. We noted above two
conditions under which it might be argued that the class—physical size correlation could be attributed to genetic factors. One condition is the instance
where marriages tend to be endogamous within class and where persons
tend to “inherit” and maintain the class
which their parents had. The other condition is where social classes differ in the
ethnic/racial groups which comprise
them. The social classes in our study will
be examined with respect to the prevalence of both of these conditions.

As a way of ascertaining the influence
of environmental factors on the social
class-physical size correlation, we shall
examine the social classes in terms of the
prevalence of infant and child mortality,
a measure which is sometimes said to be
the most sensitive index to the nutritional status, sanitary conditions, and
health care available to households.
Further, in the absence of specific information on the calorie intakes of our social classes, we shall offer some speculations as to how dietary differences may
be affecting the physical size.

Data for this study are derived from a
larger study of social class.” Interviews

mated rate of loss in stature due to aging per se for
men was 0.12 cm/yr. while for women it was 0.03
cm/yr.”’ (Himes and Mueller 1977, p. 275). Ina
study of Czechoslovakia, weight and height are
found to decrease with aging. For men, height decreases slightly from age 30 onwards, and weight
rises to age 40 and then decreases from age 40 to
49; for women, the changes are similar (Petrasek
et al., 1979, pp. 131-132).

were held with a stratified random sample of the heads of households (or their
spouses) for persons resident in 1966 in
metropolitan Madras. Each respondent
(i.e., interviewee) was asked to give information on: his or her own assessment
of the social class identification of the
household; various other socioeconomic attributes of the household; and
on the age, height, and weight of self
and spouse.

By their identifications, we were able
to classify the households into three,
broad social classes: lower class, middle
class, and upper class (for further details
on this classification, see Driver, 1981,
p. 32). While these classes are based on
self-assessments of social position, they
do correlate, quite strongly, with such
objective indicators of social position as:
man’s occupation, woman’s occupation,
man’s earnings, woman’s earnings,
man’s education, woman’s education,
and home ownership. The strength of
the relationship between social class and
these various indicators is shown by
coefficients of contingency which range
from 0.369 to 0.750, having a p-value
less than 0.05 in one instance, and pvalues less than 0.001 in all other instances.

Respondents were asked to state the
age, height, and weight for spouse and
self, as precisely as possible, and to do so
in their primary language. Where necessary, we translated terms into English
and converted metric measures into
inches and pounds. While our figures for
height and weight are based on the reports of our respondents rather than on

know one or more bits of information: own height,
own weight, spouse’s height, spouse’s weight. This
information could not be given by about the same
proportion of each social class, and thus the missing information does not alter the initial distribution of persons by social class.

measurements taken by us, we believe
the figures to be accurate because our
respondents are almost all literate and
able to count, and because studies by
other investigators find a very high correlation between reported and measured height and weight.?

70 inches, with the median being 62.5
inches. By social class, median heights
(in inches) for men are: 65.7 for the
lower class; 66.4 for the middle class;
and 67.1 for the upper class. The median
heights for women are: respectively,
62.3, 62.5, and 62.9. While social class
and height are slightly correlated, the
correlation is not statistically significant
for either men or women (Table 1).
Men range in weight from 85 pounds —
to 240 pounds, the median being 127
pounds. The median for old men (i.e.,
persons more than 40 years old) is
higher than that for young men, 130
pounds versus 126 pounds, which Is contrary to the tendency in some other nations of Asia where weight is less at
older age (Frisch and Revelle 1967, pp.
27, 28). Social class is clearly related to
weight variations among men. For
young men, the median weight (in
pounds) is 118 for the lower class, 128
for the middle class, and 140 for the upper class; for old men, the medians are,
respectively, 116, 129, and 147. The
strength of such relationships are indicated by the following Chi-squares and

men, x7 = 45.09 (df= 18, p < 0.001) and

C=0.482; for old men, y7=36.64
(df=18, p < 0.01) and C=0.399.

Women range in weight from 60
pounds to 200 pounds, the median being
105 pounds. The median for old women
(i.e., persons more than 40 years old) is
higher than that for young women, 108
pounds versus 103 pounds. As with
men, social class is clearly correlated
with the weight of women (Figure 1).
For young women, the median is 101 for
the lower class, 103 for the middle class,
and 108 for the upper class; for old
women, the medians are, respectively,
103, 109, and 122. The strength and statistical significance of these relationships
are indicated by the following chisquares and coefficients of contingency:
for young women, y* = 17.39 (df=12, p
> 0.05), and C=0.309; and for old
women, x*=37.50 (df=18, p < 0.01),
and C=0.393. Thus, while the relationships are positive, only in the case of old
women is the relationship of statistical
significance (i.e., unlikely to be the
result of simply sample size and sampling variability).

Next, we compare our respondents in
terms of general physique, or the ratio
of height to weight. Our calculation of
this ratio is based on the use of the ponderal index. This index is based on the
following formula: PI = height (inches)/
V weight (Ib.) (Edwards 1978, p.

the most useful single indicator of bodybuild (particularly in pointing up the extent of linearity)’ (Glueck and Glueck
1950, p. 189). The lower this index, the
more robust the physique; the higher
this index, the more linear the physique.
For our respondents, this index ranges
from 10.77 to 15.86 for men and from
10.26 to 15.33 for women. These extremes are obtained from persons having the following relationships of height

inches and 200 Ibs. (index of 10.26) and
60 inches and 60 Ibs. (index of 15.33).
The median indexes for men and
women, respectively, are 12.99 and
12.84. Thus, while the ranges and medians for the indexes for men and women
are similar, men and women are different from each other in their absolute
(but not proportional) height and
weight (as our extreme cases for the genders serve to illustrate).

Social class and robust physique are
weakly correlated in a positive direction: the higher the class, the more robust the physique. For men, the median
index is 13.19 for the lower class, 12.98
for the middle class, and 12.77 for the
upper class. For women, these indexes
are, respectively, 12.94, 12.81, and

12.74. The coefficients of contingency
are 0.1993 for women and 0.1396 for
men; in the latter instance, this coefficient is both weak and not statistically
significant (Table 2).

With respect to height, weight, and
the ponderal index, social classes are
distinguished only by weight, with age
held constant. This difference, which is
only moderate in its prevalence, may be
due to genetic factors and/or environmental factors which characterize the
social classes to greater or less degree.
As we noted above, the genetic factor’s
possible influence may be explored by
ascertaining whether marriages are endogamous within class and there is continuity between the social class of parents and our respondents and/or
whether the social classes differ in their
ethnic/racial composition. The influence
of the environmental factor is explored
by comparing the social classes in terms
of infant and child mortality, which is
believed to reflect the household condition with respect to nutrition, sanita

tion, and health care. Our data on these
matters suggest that genetical and environmental influences may be affecting
weight differences.

The genetical influence is suggested
by the following observations. The marriage contracts, almost all of which involved the participation of parents of
the respondents, ensure a high degree of
endogamy within social class.* While we

4Such contracts may also ensure considerable
endogamy within the kin-group. In South India,
there is still a preference for marriages between a
woman and either her mother’s brother or a crosscousin (Fa Si Son or Mo Bro Son). While we do not
know how often the parents of our respondents
were kin before marriage and do thereby transmit
to our respondents familial tendencies of height
and weight, we suspect that they often were kin.
This belief is based on our data concerning the extent to which our respondents and their spouses
were kin before marriage. Of our total respondents, 38 per cent were kin-related before marriage; there is little difference between the social
classes, with age constant. Over two-thirds of the
kin-related marriages were of the preferred types
mentioned above.

Similar findings for another district of Tail
Nadu are reported by Rao and Inbaraj (1977, pp.
282-286).

do not have information on the class
identifications of parents, we do have information on their educational and occupational statuses which shows that the
correlations (coefficient of contingency)
between the fathers of our male respondents and the fathers of their spouses are
0.630 (p = < 0.001) for education and
0.710 (p = < 0.001) for occupation.
Continuity between the social class of
parents and that of our respondents is
suggested by the correlations (coefficient of contingency) between the education and occupation of the fathers and
the social class of respondents. The values for education are 0.536 (p = <
0.001) for male respondents and 0.454
for female respondents (p = < 0.001);
the values for occupation are 0.456 for
male respondents and 0.465 for female
respondents. These correlations are
only moderately strong. They and the
correlation for endogamy do permit us
to mildly argue that the moderate correlation between the social class and
weight of our respondents is due to our
respondents being descended from persons of similar class and presumably
similar physical type. Of course, we do
not know whether the correlation between social class and weight for parents
actually existed, but for the purpose of
our argument we have made such an assumption. It is possible that some part of
the moderate correlation for our respondents reflects social mobility (comparing respondents with their parents in
terms of social class) of physical types in
a nonrandom manner.

The genetical influence on the correlation between social class and weight is
only slightly suggested by the ways in
which the social classes are differentiated in ethnic (caste and tribal/racial)
composition. Our respondents belong
to 53 castes (or jati’s) and the social

Driver and Driver

Social Biology

classes are quite unevenly comprised of
these ethnic groups. When these castes
are grouped into three broad categories
(Brahman, Non-Brahman, and Scheduled Castes), the upper class is found to
be comprised of 39 per cent Brahman
but only 7 per cent Scheduled Castes,
while the lower class is found to be comprised of zero per cent Brahman but 68
per cent—Scheduled Castes. The general correlation (coefficient of contingency) between social class and ethnic
composition is 0.418 (p = < 0.001).
While this correlation is only moderately strong, it may be noted that castes
are usually found to be genetically distinguished from one another (Naidu and
Veeraju, 1982; Papiha et al., 1980;
Sanghvi, 1966).

The moderate correlation between
social class and weight may also be due
to the influence of environmental factors. Using the infant and child mortality prevalence as an indicator of the nutritional status, sanitation, and health
care available to households, we find social class to be directly correlated with
the wholesomeness of the household.
With duration of marriage standardized, the per cent of children ever born
who have died is 9 for the upper class, 22
for the middle class, and 30 for the lower
class (Driver, 1981, p. 38).

We suspect that there are environmental, i.e., cultural, factors beyond
nutritional level, sanitation, and health
care, which contribute to social class and
general variations in physical size.” We
note the wide variations within each social class, and the overlap among the social classes, in physical size. Such varia
5Other researchers are of the opinion that consumption is affected by how income groups are internally differentiated with regard to knowledge
about nutrition (Bielicki et al., 1981, p. 550).

tion and overlap suggest that while
affluence or the lack of it may facilitate
or constrain consumption to a certain
degree, factors other than affluence and
beyond the genetical factor noted above
are cooperating with affluence, or the
lack of it, to influence physical size.
One possible factor may be the position of food, or particular kinds of food,
in the value hierarchy of various housew holds. This factor is suggested by two
S types of evidence. Jay (1961) in his study
+ Of a small group in India reveals the
'e deep psychological attachment which a
8 people may have to foodstuffs even
QA when they know them to be less nutritious, more difficult to produce, and less
economically valuable than other foodstuffs immediately available to them.
The other evidence is a set of household
budgets, which we obtained for a small
sample of very poor households in one
neighborhood of metropolitan Madras.
While we are not competent to analyze
the nutritional worth of the foodstuffs
purchased by each household, we are
able to say that these households differ
widely in their expenditures and consumption of foodstuffs, and only partly
as a consequence of differences among
them in household composition as indicated by the ages and genders of their
members.

One procedure (and admittedly a
procedure that is indirect and not flawless in its logic) for testing out the idea of
variations in the position of foodstuffs in
the value hierarchies of our respondents
is to observe the similarity between men
and women of the same households in
physical size.° Our reasoning goes some

6Garn and Cole (1979, p. 565) speak of the ‘‘cohabitational effect”: ‘Since people who live together tend to share a common diet and habits of
energy expenditure, it is reasonable to expect simi
thing like this. Given identical or almost
identical economic constraints in general, the tendency for robust men and
robust women, or linear men and linear
women, to be members of the same
household suggests that households differ in the importance which they assign
foodstuffs. Such tendency also suggests
a kind of gender equality within the
household with respect to food distribution among members.

Our analyses do suggest the existence
of variations in the importance assigned
foodstuffs, as shown by the tendency for
men and women (husbands and wives)
of the same physique to be members of
the same household. Table 3 shows the
relationship between the physiques of
husbands and the physiques of wives,
within each social class and for all social
classes. In reading the diagonal, from
upper left corner to lower right corner,
of each table, one obtains the frequency
by which husbands and wives of identical physiques belong to the same household. This identity occurs for 35.4 per
cent of the pairs in the lower class, 34.2
per cent of the pairs in the middle class,
25.7 per cent of the pairs in the upper
class; and 33.0 per cent of all pairs.

The meaning of these figures is better
obtained when they are contrasted with
what the figures would have been, had
there been a random distribution of the
physiques of husbands and wives. These
contrasts are: 35.4 per cent versus 22.8
per cent for the lower class; 34.2 per cent
versus 18.7 per cent for the middle class;
25.7 per cent versus 21.4 per cent for the

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

For nearly a century, a positive correlation between social and physical size
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 30, No. 2

has been found to occur in the several
nations where studies have been done.
India is not an exception to this pattern.
In metropolitan Madras, social class
correlates with height, weight, and physique. These correlations occur for both
men and women, and for young and old
persons in each gender category. The
correlations of social class with body size
at maturity may be accounted for in part
by their differences in ethnic composition and inheritance of different bone
structure and other physical attributes.
The class differences, especially with respect to body weight, are also due to variations in nutritional level, sanitation,
and health care in the households. Beyond this, variations in the positions
which foodstuffs have in the value hierarchy of persons may account for some
interclass as well as intraclass variation
in physical size.

There is another factor which might
contribute to class variations in physical
size. It may be that social class correlates
with length of residence in large cities,
where it appears from studies done by
the India Council of Medical
Research—that better nutrition exists
than in other places (Frisch and Revelle
1967, p. 16). Such long residence might
give an advantage in terms of growth
spurt, and this might be reflected in
adult size. Analyses of the origins and
residential patterns of our respondents
show that just about half of each social
class, within gender and age categories,
were ‘born in and have spent most of
their lives in metropolitan Madras or

Social Class and Height and Weight

other large, urban places (100,000+
population).

It should be stressed that our findings
pertain only to metropolitan Madras.
Although there are other studies of
height and weight in India, they are not
comparable to ours, either because they
do not pertain to adults and do nct consider social class (Frisch and Revelle,
1969) or because they pertain to adults,
but usually omit men as well as social
class. The latter type of study is presented along with some of our findings
in Table 4. This comparison suggests
that women of Indic origin differ considerably in height and weight according to
place of residence. Such variation in
weight among young persons, both female and male, is also found when comparing those resident in urban and rural
areas or comparing those resident in
such great cities as Hyderabad, Madras,
and other places over 100,000 population (Frisch and Revelle, 1969, pp. 201,
202).

Table 4 indicates the need for many
more definitive studies of social class
and physical size in India. The very tight
design and kinds of information which
are needed to explore in depth, and with
great care, the relations of social class to
stature and weight necessitate resources
and multiple specialists, (e.g., physical
anthropologists, nutritionists, sociologists) which are far beyond our management. Our paper must remain a modest
but, we believe, important contribution
to a topic which bears on the well being
of many groups.
