A New Stage

ABSTRACT: The epidemiologic transition theory focuses on the changing patterns of morbidity
and mortality and postulates that mortality by cause will evolve from a predominance of acute
and infectious diseases to a predominance of chronic and degenerative diseases. The
epidemiologic transition theory comprises three stages: the age of pestilence and famine (lasting
until 1875), receding pandemics (from 1875 to 1930), and degenerative and man-made diseases
(from 1930 to the present). Recent information suggests that developed societies have entered a
new stage in the transition. This fourth stage, which we term the hybristic stage, is increasingly
influenced by individual behaviors and life-styles. In this paper, we examine the epidemiologic
transition theory, substantiate the need for a new stage, and discuss current cause-specific
trends in mortality and the social and demographic implications of such trends.

The epidemiologic transition theory,
a dynamic interpretive framework, explains changes in mortality (see Omran,
various years). This theory focuses on
demographic, sociologic, economic, ecologic, and biologic antecedents and
consequences of mortality (Omran,
1977b) and describes how morbidity and
mortality by cause have evolved from a
predominance of acute and infectious
diseases to chronic and degenerative
diseases. We review this theory in light
of current changes and some trendreversals in morbidity and mortality, illustrate changes within the United
States, and propose a fourth stage, the
hybristic stage.

DISEASE PATTERNS

The epidemiologic transition theory
posits that over time disease patterns
shift so that infectious and parasitic diseases are gradually, but not totally, displaced by degenerative and man-made
diseases as the leading cause of death
(Omran, 1983). The theory comprises

three major successive stages: the age of
pestilence and famine (until 1875), receding pandemics (from 1875 to 1930),
and degenerative and man-made diseases (from 1930 to the present). In progressing from one stage to the next,
mortality declines, and life expectancy
increases. In the last stage mortality is
low and life expectancy at birth exceeds
70 years (Omran, 1982a). Below, we
discuss how the theory may mask disease interactions, cannot explain recent
declines in some chronic diseases, and
through its present conceptualization,
overlooks several broad causes of death,
including deaths due to social pathologies, which account for a substantial
portion of all deaths.

The epidemiologic transition theory
is elegant in that it concentrates on two
major types of death—infectious, and
chronic and degenerative—but it masks
interactions. For instance, the present
stage of science, technology, and
affluence provides the occasion for the
interaction between infectious and
chronic diseases. Similarly, some termi
234

nal cancer patients die of pneumonia,
influenza, or septicemia. Such examples
highlight the interplay of infectious and
chronic diseases.

The theory postulates that infectious
diseases will decline, but will not be entirely eradicated. Although the theory
applies to different sets of countries and
how they have proceeded through the
transition, we confine our analysis to the
United States. In the United States, infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, influenza, Cholera, and diptheria
represented 53 per cent of all deaths in
1900, but only 6 percent in 1970
(Omran, 1977b). However, many infectious diseases, including smallpox, have
been eradicated. Immunizations in the
United States have almost eliminated
poliomyelitis and diphtheria and potentially can eliminate measles. Because
the theory’s last stage does not account
for the possible total eradication of infectious diseases, some age groups or
specific subpopulations may have progressed past the last stage in the epidemiologic transition theory.

The epidemiologic transition theory
posits that, with time, chronic and degenerative diseases increase in importance. Between 1900 and 1970, the percentage of deaths due to heart disease
and cancer jumped from 12 to 56 per
cent. The theory, however, cannot easily account for decreases in mortality
rates for such chronic degenerative diseases as stroke and ischemic heart disease (see Crimmons, 1981; Manton and
Soldo, 1985; Rosenwaike, 1985). Figures { and 2 illustrate the rapid decrease
in ischemic heart disease and hypertension in the United States, from 1968 to
1976. Indeed, the age-adjusted death
rates declined for ischemic heart disease
by 21 per cent, for cerebrovascular disease by 28 per cent, and for hyperten

sion by 46 per cent (Rosenberg and
Klebba, 1979; see also Borhani, 1979).
Many of these declines have been realized through medical factors and lifestyle changes, including reduced cigarette smoking, increased physical
activity, and reduced intake of saturated
fats. 7

Several causes of death, including violent deaths, have changed significantly
over time, but are not considered separately under the theory. Broudy and
May (1983), in their study of Navajo Indians, found that behavior-related mortality, especially violent death, was a
leading cause of mortality. They added
the category “social pathology,” to include accidents, alcoholism, suicide,
homicide, and cirrhosis of the liver. According to the theory, the Navajos had
entered the last stage of the transition.
However, the proportion of mortality
due to degenerative diseases was rising
slowly while mortality due to social pathologies was rising rapidly (Broudy and
May, 1983).

Many deaths in the United States are
now due to social pathologies. For example, four of the ten leading causes of
death in the United States in 1984 were
due to social pathologies (see Table 1).
The top three causes of death for persons aged 15-24 were due to the social
pathologies of accidents, suicide, and
homicide and comprised over threequarters of all deaths for this age group
(see Table 2). Therefore, we see the
need to include categories that capture
violent and accidental deaths, and
deaths due to behavioral causes, in the
epidemiologic transition theory.

Cancer-specific mortality best fits the
theory, especially at ages 45 and over
(see Crimmons, 1981). Cancer at ages
less than 45, however, has not established such a clear trend. Further, mor

past century, improvement in the expectation of life at age 25, from all causes,
has been reduced by at least one-half by
smoking alone (McKeown, 1979).
Thus, behavioral factors have retarded
some declines in mortality.

Ravenholt (1984) has implicated
abuse of addictive substances—tobacco,
alcohol, opiates, cocaine, hallucinogens, stimulants, and hypnotics—with
the leading cause of death in the United
States in 1980. Abuse of these substances contributes to almost one-third
of deaths from all causes. Tobacco
smoking contributes to 25 per cent of all
deaths; alcohol consumption, to 5 per
cent; and abuse of other addictive substances, to 1—2 per cent (Ravenholt,
1984). These substances directly increase mortality risks from cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, infections, nutritional deficiencies, cirrhosis
of the liver, accidents, homicides, and
suicides (Ravenholt, 1984). Thus, the
focus on the increasing rise in degenerative diseases obscures the fact that many
of these diseases are partially caused by
individual life-styles.

FAVORED SUBPOPULATIONS
WITHIN THE TRANSITION

The epidemiologic transition favors
females over males, whites over nonwhites (in the United States), and the

young over the old (Omran, 1982,
1983). However, many of these relations have changed, as evidenced below.

Although females exhibit higher life
expectancies than males, the difference
is declining. For instance, between 1975
and 1983, life expectancy increased 2.2
years for males, but only 1.7 years for females. The racial gap shows a similar
narrowing. Between 1970 and 1983, life
expectancy increased 5.5 years for
blacks, but only 3.5 years for whites
(NCHS, 1984; see also Crimmons,
1981). Moreover, the black/white mortality crossover effect shows that older
blacks have lower mortality rates than
whites in the advanced ages (Manton,
1980; Nam et al., 1978).

Since 1960, general conditions, including mortality, of the elderly have
improved, while those of the young
have deteriorated (Preston, 1984). Life
expectancy has continued to increase,
even at very advanced ages. Table 3
shows observed life expectancies at selected ages and years, from 1901 to
1977, and projected life expectancies to
the year 2000 (Crimmons, 1981). Until
recently, the younger population
achieved the largest relative and absolute gains in life expectancy. For example, between 1901 and 1940, life expectancies increased 29 per cent at birth, but
only 8 per cent at age 65, and only 7 per

cent at age 75 and over. Between 1977
and 2000, however, life expectancies are
projected to increase over 10 per cent at
birth, but 34 per cent at age 65, and 47
per cent at age 75 and over (see Table
3). Therefore, life expectancy at birth is
increasing, but at a slower pace than life
expectancy at age 65 (Crimmons, 1981;
see also Social Security Administration,
1982).

DETERMINANTS OF
MORTALITY DECLINE

Disease pattern shifts before the
twentieth century in the United States
were more closely associated with improved nutrition, rising standards of living, and changes in the nature of some
diseases, than with medical progress. In
the twentieth century, the United States
progressed through the transition in response to medical progress and public
health programs (Omran, 1982b, 1983;
Preston, 1977).

Although the major causes of death
are still due to degenerative and manmade diseases, death is becoming increasingly influenced by individual behaviors and new life-styles, influences
not concretely addressed in the present
theory. The theory attributes declining
mortality to improving life-styles; however, cancer mortality has increased because of such detrimental life-styles as
cigarette smoking. For future mortality
reductions, we see the need to couple

Epidemiologic Transition Theory 239

medical technology, public health measures, and individual life-style changes.
For instance, recent declines in cardiovascular mortality have been realized
through the coupling of life-style

- changes (reduced cigarette smoking, in
creased recreational physical activity,
and reduced intake of saturated fats)
and medical advances and increased
public health measures (the development of the treadmill electrocardiogram, drug and surgical treatments, informational campaigns, screening
programs, and government programs
that extend low cost medical care)
(Crimmons, 1981).

Public health measures have become
increasingly important, especially insofar as they can beneficially alter individual behaviors. While new drug treatments and screening programs will help
reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, the effects will be attenuated without, say, the simultaneous interest of individuals to participate in the screening
programs and to reduce their cigarette
smoking.

Thus, while improved nutrition and
rising standards of living increased life
expectancy in the age of pestilence and
famine, where public health increased
life expectancy in the age of receding
pandemics, and where antibiotics improved life expectancies in the 1940’s
and 1950’s, it appears that new advances
have come to the fore. We may be at the
beginning of a new stage, in which mortality declines primarily will depend
upon prevention strategies and changes
in individual behavior and life-styles.

THE HYBRISTIC STAGE

The above data substantiate how survival now favors males and females, the
young and old, blacks and whites; how
some degenerative causes of death have
declined rather than increased in pre

dominance; and how deaths due to social pathology, although prevalent, cannot be explained through the theory’s
present stage. Because of these trend
changes, we suggest that the United
States has entered a new stage, which
began in the 1970’s, one we term the hybristic stage. We will now endeavor to
explain how this new stage extends the
epidemiologic transition theory.
Hybris is an _ excessive  selfconfidence, a belief that you cannot suffer, that you are invincible. Morbidity
and mortality in the hybristic stage are
affected by man-made diseases and increasing modernization as well as individual behaviors and potentially destructive life-styles. Increases in physical
inactivity, pernicious dietary practices,
and excessive drinking and cigarette
smoking can contribute to heart disease,
diabetes, chronic nephritis, lung cancer,
and cirrhosis of the liver and such social
pathologies as accidents, suicides, and
homicides (Broudy and May, 1983;
Kristein et al., 1977; McKeown, 1979).
It is interesting to note that some infectious diseases are slowly rising in importance because of individual lifestyles and man-made causes. Many of
the infectious diseases could be effectively controlled, if not completely eliminated, through immunization (United
Nations, 1984). Vaccines are one of the
most effective disease prevention technologies available (United Nations,
1984) and are available to immunize infants and children from measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, mumps, and now
meningitis, While many of these diseases have been reduced, they have not
been eradicated, because as many as
one-quarter to one-half of all pre-school
children are not completely immunized
against the above preventable diseases

 

Social Biology

in the United States (Richmond and
Filner, 1979, p. 318). Evans (1985) asks
whether the prospect for eradication
should be considered “myth or reality,”
noting that the eradication of several
diseases may be hamstrung through economic, political, or religious barriers.
Thus, greater health may now depend
on individual voluntary actions and family life-styles (Allegrante and Green,
1981).

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is directly related
to a person’s behavior and life-style, can
be contracted by contaminated blood
products (i.e., blood transfusions), intravenous drug use (through contaminated needles), and sexual, usually homosexual, contact (Curran et al.,
1985). AIDS in the United States exemplifies causes of death in the hybristic
stage. Figure 3 illustrates how quickly
the number of reported cases has risen
from its first diagnosis in 1981. Ninetythree per cent of all reported cases are
male, and 90 per cent of all cases occur
in individuals 20-49 years of age, traditionally a low-risk age group. The usual
targets of infectious diseases, infants
and the elderly, are at relatively low risk
of contracting AIDS. Ninety per cent of
all AIDS victims used intravenous drugs
or were homosexuals. “For single men
aged 25 to 44 years in Manhattan and
San Francisco, AIDS was the leading
cause of premature mortality in 1984 as
measured by years of potential life lost’’
(Curran et al., 1985). Certainly the mortality trend of AIDS and other presentday diseases is affected by specific lifestyles, such as sexual orientation.

New infectious diseases may be qualitatively different from past diseases and
from infectious diseases in developing
countries. To understand and ultimately
prevent AIDS, a disease that links sick

ness to sexuality, we must recognize its
biomedical and sociocultural characteristics (Parker, 1987). In Africa, AIDS
appears to be more pervasive, is not
concentrated in the homosexual population, and is associated with other infectious and parasitic diseases. Further, because sexual roles in Brazilian
subculture are less structured and
defined than in the United States, the
characteristics of AIDS patients are also
different. Indeed, in 1986, over 20 per

cent of the AIDS patients in Rio de Janeiro hospitals identified themselves as
bisexual, a percentage that is ten times
greater than that found in most hospitals
in Europe or the United States (Parker,
1987). Therefore, because of different
modes of transmission, associations
with other diseases, concentrations, and
levels of resistance, AIDS exhibits qualitatively different sociocultural and
biomedical attributes in less developed
countries than in the United States.

CONCLUSION

Many improvements can come about
in mortality, not only through advances
in “‘scientific medicine,’’ but also
through a greater emphasis on health
promotion and disease prevention.!
While it is disheartening to note that in
some instances we may be contributing
to, rather than preventing, mortality
through our own behavior and life-style,
it is promising to see that we can directly
influence these factors, thereby preventing mortality. Through additional re
Disease prevention and changes in behaviors
and life-styles transfers part of the responsibility
for health to the individual and family (Allegrante
and Green, 1981). Be advised, however, that
many behaviors and life-styles are shaped and reinforced through political, social, and economic
forces. It is simplistic indeed to hold solely the individual responsible for such behaviors as smoking.
Other factors are involved, such as government
subsidies of the tobacco industry, tax deductions
for cigarette advertising, work-related stress, and
until recently, general malaise concerning smoking
(Eisenberg, 1977). Thus, responsibility does not
rest solely with one individual or institution, but is
a long and complex chain (Rutstein et al., 1976).

Social Biology

search, we hope not only to reduce mortality, but to increase health.

Over time, mortality shifts from a
predominance of infectious, to manmade and degenerative, to hybristic diseases, The hybristic stage witnesses the
eradication of most environmentallybased infectious diseases. Those infectious diseases not eradicated are perpetuated, if not actually caused by
individual behaviors and life-styles.
Thus, in explaining the increase in mortality due to social pathologies and
changing life-styles, we have extended
epidemiologic transition theory through
the present period, with the hybristic
stage.
