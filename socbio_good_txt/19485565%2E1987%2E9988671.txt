Perils of Single Life and Benefits of Marriage

ABSTRACT: It has long been observed that married persons experience more favorable mortality

than unmarried persons. Hypotheses about possible explanations for mortality differentials by
marital status fall into three general categories: (1) hypotheses regarding errors in the data, (2)
hypotheses related to the selection of persons into and out of marital states, and (3) hypotheses
regarding environmental and behavioral factors associated with various marital states. In this
paper the authors investigate the extent to which mortality differences by marital status are
similar across populations and assess the importance of selection factors in producing the excess

mortality of the single populations.

It has long been observed that married persons experience more favorable
mortality than unmarried persons. A geneological study of ruling-class men and
women married between 1500 and 1899
in Europe shows that single persons suffered higher death rates than evermarried persons (Peller, 1943, 1947).
Data from France show that the married
have consistently experienced a mortality advantage over the single in that
country (Farr, 1858). March (1912)
presents age-specific death rates by marital status for the period 1886-95 separately for France, Prussia, and Sweden.
In those countries the death rates were
highest for widowed and divorced persons, next highest for single persons,
and lowest for married persons. LiviBacci (1984) shows the ratio of the probability of dying for single persons to that
of the married for the Italian population
for various years during the period
1881-1961. These ratios reveal that single Italian men and women have consistently experienced excess mortality over
their married counterparts.

Hypotheses about possible explanations for mortality differentials by marital status fall into three general categories: (1) hypotheses regarding errors in

the data, (2) hypotheses related to the
selection of persons into and out of marital states, and (3) hypotheses regarding
environmental and behavioral factors
associated with various marital states.
Prior to any discussion of substantive explanations of mortality differentials by
marital status, it is important to question
whether or not the differentials are genuine. Errors in vital registration data or
census data could contribute to and possibly explain the observed differentials
in mortality by marital status. A variety
of errors in the data could distort mortality differentials by marital status, including differential age misstatement by
marital status in either death registration or census data, misreporting of
marital status on death certificates or
census forms, differential underregistration of deaths by marital status, and differential undercount of the population
by marital status. There have been a few
studies regarding the contribution of errors in the data to differentials in the
United States. They indicate that data
problems are important but unlikely to
completely explain observed mortality
differentials by marital status in the
United States (Kitigawa and Hauser,
1973; Hambright, 1968).

Hypotheses in the second category of
explanations for mortality differentials
by marital status suggest that marriage is
selective. It selects healthier persons
and leaves among the single a higher
proportion of persons with serious
health problems. Livi-Bacci (1984) suggests that marriage selection may operate in two ways: through temporary selection and through permanent
selection. In the first case, marriage selects persons on the basis of their health
at the time of marriage. Initially, married persons are freer of major health
problems. However, this advantage is
gradually lost with time as health problems not present at the time of marriage
develop among married and single persons. Temporary selection also works
through the decisions of persons to postpone marriage to a less hazardous period of their lives. Temporary selection
would produce strong mortality differentials at short durations of marriage
but would have no effect at longer durations, and the advantage of the married
would tend to disappear. To test for the
effects of temporary selection, mortality
rates by marital status and duration of
marriage would be required. These data
do not currently exist.

In contrast to temporary marriage selection, permanent selection occurs
when marriage selects constitutionally
healthier persons, leaving among the
single a relatively high proportion of
permanently health-impaired or frail individuals. The effect of permanent selection on mortality differentials by
marital status would be evident in a
growing excess mortality of the single
relative to the married up to the age at
which very few additional single persons
marry, after which excess mortality
would remain constant.

Hypotheses in the third category include hypotheses positing a beneficial,

protective effect of marriage, hypotheses suggesting that changes in marital
status and their effects produce mortality differentials, and hypotheses suggesting that mortality differentials by
marital status are due to differences in
unmeasured characteristics, such as
smoking habits, which affect mortality
and are correlated with marital status
(Gove, 1973; Klebba, 1970; Helsing et
al., 1981; Kobrin and Hendershot,
1977). For example, Gove (1973) and
Kobrin and Hendershot (1977) argue
that marriage protects against death by
promoting social integration, which enriches and lengthens life.

It is likely that a combination of selective and behavioral/environmental factors produce the observed marital status
differentials. Marriage may select
healthier persons and also protect those
who marry. It is also possible that marrage 1s selective, but selects persons not
according to health per se but rather on
the basis of their ability to form social
ties, which in turn promotes lower mortality. Experimental data in which
women and men with known characteristics are randomly assigned to marital
states would be required to conclusively
distinguish the contribution of marriage
selection, either permanent or temporary, and the contribution of various environmental and behavioral factors associated with marital states to observed
differentials in mortality by marital status. Obviously, such experiments cannot be performed. Longitudinal data,
including marital histories and duration
in marital states, would augment and
improve the observational data now
available, but such data are very expensive to collect and tend to have sample
sizes too small to study some of the effects of interest. Therefore, it is important to learn as much as we can about the
explanations underlying mortality dif

ferentials by marital status from crosssectional data currently available.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The objective of the present analysis
is to assess the extent to which mortality
differences by marital status are similar
across populations and to determine the
importance of selection factors in producing the excess mortality among the
single populations. We focus our investigation on countries known to have
high-quality mortality and population
data, primarily countries in Western Europe. Using census tabulations and
death registration data from these countries, we compare death rates by marital
Status across countries and within selected countries over time. Our primary
tool for determining the existence of selection factors is a comparison between
the magnitude of excess mortality for
single persons and the relative size of the
single population.

Wales, and United States whites’). In all
cases, despite any differences in marriage behavior that may exist, married
persons experience lower mortality
rates relative to persons in all other marital states.

While the married consistently experience the lowest death rates in these
countries, the ranks of the death rates of
the other three marital states are less
consistent. For example, single males
have the highest death rates relative to
widowed and divorced men in Japan
and Sweden, but divorced men tend to
experience the highest mortality in the
United States and in England and
Wales. For women in Sweden, Japan,
and England and Wales, the single tend
to have the highest death rates, but in
the United States divorced women have
slightly higher death rates. In addition,
the differentials in death rates across the
three nonmarried states for both sexes
range from very large for Japan to virtually nonexistent for England and Wales.

In order to examine more systematically the extent to which mortality differentials by marital status are similar
among developed countries, we gathered recent data on death rates by age
and marital status for developed countries for which data are available. We
applied a median polish procedure (Tukey, 1977) to these data to distinguish
effects due to marital status from effects
due to age and the general level of mor

and widowed persons (Klebba, 1970;
Gove, 1973; Fox and Goldblatt, 1982;
and Koskenvuo et al., 1980), the results
in Figure 3a suggest that across developed countries there is no notable difference in mortality risks among these
three nonmarried groups. The boxplots
also indicate that the distributions of
countries according to the mortality effects associated with each marital state
are fairly compact.

The boxplots shown in Figure 3b are
derived from the same data but show the
difference between the death rates of
married and nonmarried persons. For
each country in the analysis, the mortal
ity effect for married persons was subtracted from that of single, widowed,
and divorced persons to obtain the relative mortality effects associated with
each nonmarried state (i.e., the excess
mortality rates of the unmarried relative
to the married). The boxplots for both
males and females confirm the observation from Figure 3a that the distribution
of mortality effects are quite similar for
all three nonmarried states. The relative
mortality effects for females are smaller
in magnitude than those for males, on
average indicating excess deaths among
the unmarried of two to three per thousand for females and eight to ten per

thousand for males, and the distnbutions of relative mortality effects for females across countries are more compact. There are several outliers for the
males. In both Portugal and Japan the
excess death rate of the single relative to
the married is exceptionally high; in
New Zealand, Portugal, Austria, and
Norway the excess mortality of the widowed is particularly high, while in Bulgaria and East Germany it is especially
low; and in Scotland the excess death
rate of divorced men is exceptionally
high. There are also several outliers in
the boxplots for women. In Romania
and Japan single women suffer exceptionally high excess death rates relative
to married women; in Poland and Bulgaria the excess death rates of the widowed are especially low; and the excess
mortality of divorced women is particularly high in Denmark, while it is especially low in Romania and New
Zealand. These outliers possibly reflect
different customs and attitudes in these
countries toward persons of different
marital states. For example, the exceptionally low excess death rates of the
widowed are observed in East European countries where respect for elderly
parents, especially widows, is likely to
be greater.

MARRIAGE SELECTION: COMPARISONS
Across COUNTRIES

It is clear that in developed countries
married persons of both sexes experience a marked mortality advantage relative to single individuals. In order to explore the role of selective marriage
behavior in producing the mortality disadvantage of the unmarried, correlation
analyses between the magnitude of the
excess mortality and the relative size of
the unmarried populations were performed. The underlying hypothesis is

Social Biology

that populations in which the vast majority of women marry should be characterized by greater selectivity effects
among those who remain single than
populations in which substantial proportions of people never marry. If such selection exists, the correlation should be
apparent at an age by which the majority of persons (who will eventually
marry) have already done so. Livi-Bacci
(1984) first tested the selection hypothesis by correlating the proportion single
(never-married) at ages 40 to 44 with the
ratio of the mortality rate of the single to
the mortality rate of the married in the
same age group. For females he finds a
strong negative correlation (—0.60); for
males the correlation is significantly
weaker (—0.36). These results support
the hypothesis that permanent marriage
selection contributes to observed mortality differentials by marital status, especially for women. However, it is important to note that in the correlation
for males, two outliers contribute heavily to the negative correlation. If Japan
and Ireland are removed from LiviBacci’s analysis, the correlation between the proportion of males who are
single and the male mortality ratio falls
close to zero (—0.07) and offers little
support for the permanent selection hypothesis among males.

In order to examine the evidence for
selection in a more general way, we carried out similar types of correlation
analyses for a wider range of age groups
on another data set from 26 developed
countries around 1980.* The correlation

‘Livi-Bacci’s analysis used data that differed
from the data used in the present analysis in two
ways: (1) his data were for 21 countries for the period around 1970, and (2) his group of countries included the United States, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Spain, but did not include

coefficients for each of the age groups
from 20-—24 to 65-74 are shown in Table
1. The relationship between proportions
single and excess mortality of the single
is consistently negative across all ages
for both sexes. The correlations for
women are fairly strong and relatively
constant with age, starting with —0.59 at
ages 20-24 and dropping slightly to
—0.49 at ages 65—74. The same correlations for men, also shown in Table 1, are
negligible before age 35, small for ages
35-44, but then rise to around —0.50
and remain relatively constant thereafter.

Removing possible outliers from the
correlation analyses does not substantially alter the results, indicating that the
coefficients for females shown in Table 1
are reasonably robust. The correlations
for males are somewhat more affected
by the presence of outliers, as noted in

Singapore. The countries included in our analysis
were chosen on the basis of having data included in
recent volumes of Demographic Yearbook and
having reliable mortality data.

35-44 are similar to those of Livi-Bacci.
The correlation coefficient between the
proportion single and the ratio of the
death rates of single to married persons
is strongly negative for females (—0.60),

- while the corresponding coefficient for

males is negative but small (—0.26).

The age patterns of correlation coefficients relating proportions single and
excess mortality of the single for women
show that there is already substantial evidence of marriage selection in the age
group 20 to 24 years, with a correlation
coefficient of —0.59, when the average
proportion single is 45 per cent (and
ranges from 24 to 69 per cent). The fact
that the correlations do not become
stronger as the proportions single decrease, but remain relatively constant,
may indicate that the effects of selection
are at least partially temporary, or it
may reflect the nature of the distributions of frailty among women. If substantial proportions of women are subject to higher than average risks of
mortality (for example, 20-40 per
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

cent), then the differential in death rates
between the married and the single will
be established at an early age, and the
marriage of some of the more robust single women at later ages will raise the
death rates of the single and of the married and may not change the differentials at all. To the extent that age is a
proxy for marriage duration, the fairly
constant strong correlation coefficients
suggest that the effects of marriage selection are to a large degree permanent.
For males, the age pattern of correlation coefficients relating proportions
single and excess mortality of the single
does not show strong evidence of selective marriage behavior until the age
group 45 to 54 years, when an average of
only 8 per cent of men remain single.
The different age patterns of correlation
coefficients suggest that marriage selection is considerably weaker for men than
for women. However, evidence presented in the next section implies that
selection operates similarly for men and
women within individual countries.
Therefore, the different age patterns of
correlation coefficients for men and
women may be the result of differences
among countries in marriage customs,
particularly as they affect men.

MARRIAGE SELECTION: COMPARISONS
WITHIN COUNTRIES

Because international differences in
nuptiality can confound our interpretation of the above correlation analyses,
we Studied the selectivity effect by analyzing cohorts of men and women from a
single country over time. While marriage customs and the nature of marriage itself may change over time within
a given country, these changes are apt to
be much smaller than those across populations.

Social Biology

France was one of the countries chosen for the more detailed cohort analysis
because of its generally high quality
mortality data and the availability of
death rates by marital status for a relatively long period of time. We examined
the relationship between proportions
single and ratios of the death rates of the
single to the death rates of the married
from three different perspectives. First
we looked at the relationship from a period perspective by plotting the ratio of
death rates of the single to the death
rates of the married against proportions
single for selected years ranging from
1886 to 1976. This has been done for
French men in the first panel of Figure 4.
The lines simply connect points for the
age groups 20-24 to 35—39 in each given
year. We observe from this graph that
the relationship is negative in all years.
In addition, the level of the relationship
tends to mse in successive periods so
that, over time, the death rate of the single relative to the married associated
with each proportion single has increased. It is possible that this may be
partially accounted for by our chosen
measure of mortality differentials (ratio
of death rates) and its behavior in the
presence of changing levels of mortality,
but, as we show later, we do not observe
the same rise in all countries where mortality has been improving.

In the second panel of Figure 4, we
examine the relationship between proportions single and ratios of death rates
of the single relative to the married from
the perspective of cohorts of French
men. Here the lines connect points associated with the given cohort. Again the
relationship is negative for every cohort
for which we have data. As in the case of
periods, the level of the relationship
rises aS we consider more recent cohorts.

Finally, we investigated the relationship between proportions single and the
relative death rates of the single versus
the married within age groups. These relationships are plotted for French men
in the third panel of Figure 4. In this
panel the lines are regression lines fitted
to the points associated with each age
group. Since the proportions married
have generally declined over the years,
it is theoretically possible that the correlations in the last panel of Figure 4
reflect little more than the increases in
the relative mortality rates which have
occurred over time and cohort. However, the strength of the correlations between the proportions single and the relative mortality rate for each age group,
as compared with those for periods or
cohorts, suggest that the correlations

reflect more than a period effect. Subse-.

quent analyses for other countries, described below, confirm this. In addition,
the increase in the magnitude of the correlation coefficient with increasing age
group is consistent with marriage selection hypotheses which are based on the
supposition that marriage continuously
selects the healthiest persons from the
single population. At the youngest ages
when few people have married, the single include many healthy as well as unhealthy persons and we would expect
only a weak correlation between the
proportions single and the excess mortality of the single. By age 35 or 40, when
the vast majority have married and single persons constitute a very select subpopulation, we would expect a much
stronger correlation. It is also interesting that we find such strong evidence of
marriage selection for French men, although the cross-national correlations
suggested that selection is not as important a factor in explaining mortality differentials by marital status for males.

 

Kisker and Goldman

Social Biology

The comparable graphs for French
women are presented in Figure 5. They
suggest that the underlying explanations
for mortality differentials by marital status in France are largely similar for both
men and women. It is interesting to note
that we find a strengthening relationship
between proportions single and excess
mortality of the single as age increases in
France, whereas we did not find a
strengthening relationship in the crosscountry analysis.

Similar analyses were carried out on
additional countries with high quality
population and mortality data and with
varying trends in age at marriage to determine whether the evidence for selection was consistently strong. The results
(for age groups only) for Japan are
shown in Figure 6 for males and females. Unlike France in which proportions single declined over most of the
period considered (rising only in the
most recent years), proportions single
have been increasing steadily in nearly
all age groups in Japan over the relevant
period. The relationship between proportions single and the excess mortality
of the single is consistently negative,
whether it is viewed from the period, cohort, or age perspective. Although there
are no clear-cut period or cohort trends
in the relative mortality rate of the single
to the married, the correlations between
the proportions single and the excess
mortality of the single are strong for
most age groups. These results for both
males and females in Japan confirm the
importance of selection effects in producing the higher death rates of the
never-married population.

We repeated the analysis for both
England and Wales and Sweden. The
results (for age-group only) are shown in
Figures 7 and 8. These figures confirm
our consistent finding of a negative relaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

tionship between proportions single and
excess mortality of the single. However,
the relationships, when viewed from the
period and cohort perspectives (not
shown), are flatter than those shown in
the figures for France and Japan, indicating that a smaller increase in excess
mortality of the single is associated with
a given decrease in the proportion single. In addition, the correlations between proportions single and excess
mortality of the single for specific age
groups tend to be much weaker in the
younger age groups for males in these
countries, especially in Sweden; moreover, for Swedish males aged 35-39 and
40-44, the direction of the correlation is
reversed. The weaker evidence for marriage selection in these data for Swedish
males is not altogether surprising given
the high level of informal cohabitation
in Sweden present throughout the relevant period.

CONCLUSION

In this paper we have explored the
role of marriage selection in producing
the excess mortality among single relative to married persons consistently observed in developed countries. The role
of marriage selection was investigated
by examining correlation coefficients relating proportions single and the excess
mortality of the single relative to the
married from a variety of perspectives:
across developed countries and, within
select countries, from age, period, and
cohort perspectives. The correlation
coefficients are negative in nearly all instances, suggesting that marriage selection may be an important contributor to
mortality differentials by marital status.

Previous analyses have suggested
that there may be some differences between the sexes in the strength of selec

tion and the role of selection as age progresses. These analyses as well as the
cross-sectional comparison presented
here indicate that marriage selection is
more important in explaining differentials for females than for males. The fact
that the individual country analyses do
not show sex differences in the strength
of marriage selection (except for Sweden), however, implies that the apparent sex differences may simply reflect
greater variation in marriage customs
among men across countries in the analysis. The very high correlation coefficients between the proportions single
and the relative mortality rate of the single to the married for men and women in
most age groups between 30 and S50 in
France, Japan, and England and Wales
suggests that much of the excess mortality of the never-married population in
these countries is due to an important
selectivity effect, i.e., health conditions
appear to deter some persons from entering marriage.

Although this research has demonstrated the importance of selection in
producing excess mortality risks among
the never-married population, it offers
us no guidance as to the potential existence of protective or mortality-reducing
effects of marriage. As noted earlier, experimental data in which women and
men with known characteristics are randomly assigned to marital states would
be required to conclusively distinguish
the contribution of marriage selection
and the contribution of various protective factors to differentials in mortality
by marital status.
