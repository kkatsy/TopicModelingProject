ABSTRACT: A simple version of Easterlin’s relative-cohort-size model of fertility is presented
and used to forecast fertility. The model tracks postwar U.S. experience closely and predicts an
-Cupturn in fertility in the 1980’s. To illustrate the model’s long-run properties, births are forecast
Eto the year 2070. The forecast shows pronounced every-other generation cycles in births sug
esting that, unless conditions change, concern with the economic consequences of declining
Population growth and crises in education and the youth labor market may be recurring fea
Stures of the U.S. system.

‘In the 1930’s and early 1940’s a de=clining fertility rate led economists to
speculate on the economic and social
Seonsequences of declining population
‘growth. Keynes (1937) was concerned
Sthat the Malthusian evil might be ex‘changed for “the devil of unemploySent escaping through the breakdown
oof effective demand.” Glass (1937) and
‘Spengler (1941) were concerned about
“the impacts of declining numbers on the
temand for goods and services and eco‘thomic efficiency. Spengler foresaw potential problems for the regional and oc‘cupational distribution of labor,
Gunemployment, and changes in “the
character of fundamental economic and
politico-economic decisions and decision making” as the age composition of
the working population changed.

The declining fertility rate of the
1960’s and 1970’s and the forecast of
continued decline (Butz and Ward,
1979) has been accompanied by the expression of many of the concerns of the
1930’s and 1940’s. A book edited by Espenshade and Serow (1978) focused on
the economic consequences of declining
population growth and Spengler (1975)

17

readdressed many of the issues he had
discussed over thirty years before.

The rising fertility rates of the 1940’s
and 1950’s allayed fears of a long-run decline in population growth and its associated economic consequences. Wil] the
more recent expression of these concerns
also be quieted by rising fertility rates?

The work of Butz and Ward (1979,
1980) and Westoff (1978) would seem to
indicate not. However, work by Easterlin, Wachter, and Wachter (1977,
1978), Wachter (1975), and Lee (1976)
indicates the potential for a rising fertility rate in the coming decade. In the first
section of this paper, the EasterlinWachter-Wachter fertility model and its
recent formalization by Samuelson is
outlined; the second section reports the
estimation of the model, its forecast for
the 1980’s, and the long-run forecasts of
the model through the year 2070. The
implications of the study are discussed in
the last section.

U.S. population swings in which “‘prior
to the period dating roughly from the
close of the Second World War, a movement in the rate of population growth
was initiated by a movement in aggregate demand, but did not itself initiate a
movement in aggregate demand and, in
the absence of swings in aggregate demand, population growth would have
been fairly steady.” That is to say, population growth would have assumed a
Lotka stable-growth path. However, in
the postwar period a new relation between economic and demographic
swings arose. Countercyclical monetary
and fiscal policy dampened aggregate
demand shocks while restrictive immigration and the incipient decline of the
farm population shrank the traditional
sources of reserve labor. Thus, the rate
of natural increase now determined,
with a lag, the working-age population
and to a large extent the domestic labor
supply. With damped aggregate demand fluctuations, the age structure of
the working age population determined
relative income (the income of young
workers relative to their expected income) and this, in turn, determined fertility. Given the general equilibrium
nature of the analysis, one may solve out
the economic variables to derive a
closed demographic model which would
generate every other generation cycles
in births, so-called “new” Kuznets cycles, rather than a smooth path for population growth.

This model is an elaboration of the
earlier Easterlin relative-income model
of fertility (Easterlin, 1961, 1968, 1973).
In a recent paper Samuelson (1976) formalized the Easterlin model. Following
Samuelson, the main elements of the
model may be specified as follows. Let
there be two age groups: N,(f), the number of persons in the prime childbearing

Social Biology

stage of life; N2(¢), the number of those
some twenty years older who are in the
last years of childbearing. Of those born
at time ¢, B(t), p,B(t) survive to constitute N, (f+ 1) and p;p2B(t) survive to
constitute Nz (t+2). The mortality
rates, p, are assumed constant. Let (f,,
f2) represent the age-specific fertility
rates. The first f;, depends upon the ratio of numbers in the two adult age
groups, namely on N,(t)/N2(t), where

This result follows from a consideration of the following fundamental behavioral relationships of Easterlin’s
model:!

RY=Kk(N,/N>)

 

fi=h(RY)
where
aRY of
——— <0 > 0;
a(N,/N2) aRY
therefore
of af; aRY

ES 8 0
d(N,/N>) ORY = a(N,/N2)

where RY is relative income. That is, an
increase in relative cohort size reduces
relative income which, in turn, reduces
fertility.

The autonomous dynamic system can
be reduced to:

BO)=fiNi)+f2N2(0) =fip:B(t—-1)

+ fopip2B(t—2). (1)

'Ahiburg (1982) presents results which support
the empirical validity of the behavioral relationships of the Easterlin model. See Easterlin (1980)
for a full discussion of the model.

Upon substitution we have:

B(t) =pyfilpiB(t-1) / pip2
B(t~2)] B(t-1) + fopip2 B(t-2)

=a,[B(t—-1) / B(t—2)]B(t-1)
+ a2B(t—2)

where

a,{B(t-1) / B(t—2)]=pifiB(t-1) /
p2B(t-2)|

a“[N,/N2]<0;

AIN(0), N,(0)] = [N%, N3] or [B_.,, B_,]
sethe system forever after determines its
own development:

(=B(tNY, N9)=b(t; B,_,, B,») t20.

Thus, Samuelson shows that the Easerlin theory collapses to a single equation in which present fertility is a funcStion of past fertility. Samuelson goes on
‘Sto show that if the Easterlin effect is sufficiently strong the population under
ostudy will exhibit a stable-limit cycle
‘Srather than settling down to its Lotka

concerns us at this stage is Samuelson’s

RESULTS

ESTIMATION AND SHORT-RUN
FORECASTING

Equation 1 does in fact yield an estimable equation. The equation, as set
out below, is nonlinear in variables
rather than in parameters and thus may
be estimated by standard least squares
techniques:

B,=a,(B,_,)? / B,_,+@2B,_.+€; (2)

where B is total live births and €, is a random disturbance term distributed normally with mean zero. The lag t—-1 is
twenty years, and the lag t—2 is forty
years. These lags are based on Samuelson’s specifications and lag lengths
reported by Easterlin, Wachter, and
Wachter (1978, p. 128-129). They also
correspond to the cycle period found by
Lee (1974a) for the United States.
Equation 2 was estimated over the period 1949 to 1978, and the equation was
used to forecast total live births out to
1990.
The birth equation was:

=3157.730 —0.122 B*, + 0.416 B,_.
(3.706)** (—3.222)** (1.568) (3)

R2=0.943 DW=1.424 p=0.762
S.E. =95.764

where
B* = (By)? / B,_ 4):

Statistics in parentheses are f statistics;
** signifies significant at the 0.01 level.
This equation was estimated using a
Cochrane-Orcutt adjustment for firstorder serial correlation.

The cohort size variable B* 1s highly
significant while the variable B,_,, 1s almost significant at the 0.1 level. The
model tracks the U.S. time series very
closely, as shown in Figure 1. The forecast is presented in Table 1 along with a
translation of the total birth forecast
into a corresponding forecast for the
general fertility rate.

The model predicts a further decline
in the fertility rate in 1979, but a rise in
total live births, reflecting an increase in
the number of women in the prime
childbearing years. From 1980 until
1987 there is a substantial rise in both
the fertility rate and total live births, although slight reversals occur in 1984 and
1985. By 1987 the general fertility rate is
predicted to be 17 per cent above its

  

  

1978 level, while total live births are 31
per cent above the 1978 figure. Thus,
the fertility rate is predicted to reach a
level similar to that of the early 1970’s,
while the number of total live births is
predicted to reach levels comparable to
those attained at the peak of the postwar
baby boom. Insum, we predict a level of
fertility significantly higher than that experienced in the recent past and a
“boom” in total live births, which is a
product of this higher level of fertility
and an increase in the number of women
in the prime childbearing years of 15 to
44.

It seems that the simple version of the
closed model derived by Samuelson not
only tracks the U.S. experience well
but also predicts a revival of fertility and

dates this revival as commencing in the
early 1980’s. This forecast is in direct
‘contrast to the predictions of the ‘“‘new
fiousehold economics” model of Butz
ind Ward (1979, 1980), who conclude,
‘ewe look for a continuing secular fertilty decline toward some asymptote

A LONG-RUN FORECASTS

While the model has been used to explain the pattern of births in the postwar
period and produce short-run forecasts,
it may also be used to illustrate that, by
‘‘a ‘continuance’ of what has been going
on [government sustained growth in labor demand and restricted immigration]
and without any ‘violent or unnatural

changes’ (Cannan’s words), the future
may turn out to be very different from
what is commonly supposed.” Our purpose here is not to produce a confident
prediction of the future but to “instill
skepticism about other people’s confident predictions [of a continuation of
the recent decline in fertility] (Hajnal,
1955, p. 316).

Equation 2 was used to forecast total
births out to the year 2070, that is, almost one hundred years beyond the estimation period. The path of total births
may be summarized by dating the peaks
and troughs generated as shown in Table 2.

As can be seen from this data, the
model forecasts cycles of approximately
forty years in length, consistent with the
underlying model.* The numerical
analysis indicates a rising trend in fertility and a decrease in the amplitude of
the cycles. The former is consistent with
an upward trend in relative income and
the latter with a decreasing incompatibility between childbearing and market
work. The behavior of this model in the
future closely resembles the path to

‘The cycles generated are for total live births.
However, because of the inverse relation asserted
between total births and the age structure, the cycles in total births also imply cycles in the fertility
rate.

equilibrium predicted by Lee for his
age-structured fertility model subject to
environmental constraint (Lee, 1974a).

Thus, if the conditions which prevailed in the postwar period continue
into the future, fertility in the U.S. will
exhibit cycles rather than a decline to
some new low level. However, what will
happen if conditions are different? If the
government does not continue to maintain a high and growing demand for labor by active monetary and fiscal policy
and/or if it relaxes its restrictive immigration policy, then the fundamental
causes of the forty year cycles in fertility
will cease to exist and the ‘‘ ‘new’
Kuznets cycle will join the old as a historical curiosity” (Easterlin, 1980, p.
144).

The cycles in fertility will damp down
if sex roles change significantly and if the
labor force participation rate of young
females continues to rise. Westoff
(1978) predicts a change in roles
whereas Easterlin (1980) is skeptical of
any significant change. The damping influence of rising participation rates may
be reduced by growth in childcare facilities, maternity leave, and part-time employment.

A decline in the relative prosperity of
smaller cohorts will also decrease the
trend and amplitude of cycles in fertility.
For example, the relative economic position of the current baby-bust generation may be reduced by an increase in
the rate of illegal immigration, the
downgrading of baby-boom generation
labor, and the increase in the average
age of retirement. Of these possibilities,
illegal immigration seems to pose the
greatest threat. Current studies of laborsubstitution show relatively limited substitution possibilities between workers
aged 14-24 years and 25-54 years (An
 

Social Biology

derson 1977). Substitution is higher between young workers and workers over
55 years of age, but the baby-boom generation will not be of this age when the
baby-bust generation enters the labor
market.

IMPLICATIONS

The relative-cohort-size fertility
model presented in this paper predicts
that U.S. fertility will rise throughout
the 1980’s. This prediction is in marked
contrast to those offered recently by
Westoff (1978) and Butz and Ward
(1979, 1980). If this upswing in fertility
persists, as the model suggests it will, recently expressed concern about the economic consequences of a declining population will be allayed. Also the future
of ‘‘youth”’-based industries—especially
education—may not be as bleak as is
commonly thought.

Illustrative long-run forecasts from
the model suggest that the time path of
U.S. fertility displays cycles of approximately forty years in length. These cycles produce cycles in the age-structure
of the labor force and suggest that if certain characteristics of the U. S. economy and society remain unchanged,
concern about the consequences of declining population growth, crises in education and other “youth’’-based industries, and the adverse labor market
experience of the young may be recurring features of the U.S. system.°

system, see Keyfitz (1978), and Ahlburg ct al.
