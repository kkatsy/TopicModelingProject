ABSTRACT: This paper examines trends in childlessness for ever-married women in the United
States. Data assembled from assorted census materials permit cohort and period investigations for
a number of time periods, from 1910 to 1975, for various color and ethnic groups. Whether
examined at the period or cohort level, the incidences in percentage rates of childlessness have
varied irregularly over time. We focus particularly on the younger cohorts of white women (those
beginning fecundity after 1965); they show higher rates of childlessness at each age than any of the
older cohorts at similar ages in the reproductive cycle. We suggest that a major portion of the
increasing rates of these younger cohorts may be attributed to increases in voluntary childlessness,
which in turn may be linked to broader changes in the fabric of society regarding fertility control,
contraceptive technology, female work preferences and patterns, and sexual and family norms.

The phenomenon of childlessness has
received only modest attention in recent
years by sociologists, demographers, and
marriage and family-life scholars. In one
sense, this void may result from the tendency to view childlessness merely as one
of a number of possible fertility outcomes,
in this case, zero parity. Since specific attention is seldom focused solely on
couples, say, with three children, or with
one child, why then should there exist a
literature dealing only with persons who
have no children?

A second reason involves the actual incidence of childlessness. Over the years,
few American women have been without
children, and until recently, childlessness
rates have been experiencing a steady decline. Indeed, so seldom did the phenomenon occur and so pervasive had been its
decline that many investigators concluded
that “the desire for children is nearly universal” (Martinson, 1970, p. 314) and that
“the majority of childless couples are not
that way by choice” (Bell, 1971, p. 417).

Childlessness viewed in this light, of
course, is congruent with the pronatalist
norms and values in our society concerning marriage and procreation. Since married persons are expected to have children,
should want to have children, and should
rejoice at the prospect of having children
(Veevers, 1973b, p. 199), the lack of attention given the study of childlessness
may result in part from the general lack of
approval afforded the phenomenon by the
society at large.

However, some demographers and sociologists in the past few years have argued that the United States is experiencing
significant change regarding contraceptive
technology, sexual and family norms, and
female work patterns and preferences
(Presser and Bumpass, 1972; Bumpass,
1973; Westoff, 1976). It is claimed that
one result of these alterations is the fact
that motherhood is becoming for many a
matter for rational evaluation. Because
“motherhood [is placed] squarely in competition with other social roles” (Bumpass,

212
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 3

1973, p. 68), voluntary childlessness is increasingly entertained as a viable option.

Whatever the cogency and validity of
these ideas, a detailed study and interpretation of childlessness trends in the United
States would be especially time!y at this
point. A reasonably thorough <eries of
childlessness data for ever-married U.S.
women may be assembled frcm assorted
census materials, thus permitting period
and cohort investigations of the phenomenon (see Hastings and Robinson, 1975, for
another statement focusing especially on
cohorts).

Objectives of this type will characterize
the present paper. We pay attention first
to the overall incidence of childlessness in
the United States and note its variability
over time (since 1910) among women of
different ages and different color and
ethnic groups. This investigation of period
rates is then followed by a cohort analysis
of the phenomenon, Whether studied at
the period or cohort level, this study will
suggest that childlessness has not maintained a steady course over the past 65
years in the United States and that, in
particular, the incidence of the phenomenon has increased in recent years. Our
interpretation of these trends will focus
especially on the last five to ten years, and
we will propose that a viable reason for
the increase, especially among white
women, lies in the fact that many couples
today are voluntarily deciding to remain
without children. Prior to exploring this
explanation in any detail, we turn to an
examination of childlessness trends.

CHILDLESSNESS TRENDS

Since 1940, the U.S. Bureau of the Census has published information on the
number of children ever born to women in
the United States. These data have been
obtained both through the decennial censuses and through sample surveys con

ducted by the census bureau, viz., Current
Population Surveys (see Shryock and
Siegel, 1973, Vol. I, pp. 71-75). When
publishing materials based on the 1940
census, the bureau also provided fertility
information from the 1910 census (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1943, pp. 1-6). It is
thus possible to assemble percentage rates
of childlessness for ever-married U.S.
women for 12 time periods from 1910
through 1975. These data are provided in
Table 1.

The periods for which childlessness data
are available are irregularly spaced over
time, and most of the observations pertain
to the periods since 1960. Nevertheless,
the information in Table 1 demonstrates
rather clearly that the incidence of
childlessness in the United States has not
been without fluctuation (see Gustavus
and Henley, 1971, and Hastings and
Robinson, 1975, for similar statements).
The rate of childlessness increased between 1910 and 1940 and then experienced
a decline until 1965. In the past ten years,
the rates have varied somewhat irregularly, although by 1975 there had been a

net increase of more than four percentage
points. At first glance, it would appear
that the phenomenon is beginning to increase once again after an extended period
of prolonged decrease.

Table 1, however, represents in a rather
gross manner the variability of U.S.
childlessness since 1910. The denominator
includes all ever-married women between
the ages of 15 and 44. Women in the latter
childbearing years are combined with
women just entering the fecund period, for
example, and white women are grouped
with nonwhite women. The rates may
thus be misleading because of varying
proportions over time in the numbers of

women both in the different childbearing
years and in the various color and ethnic
groups.

In an attempt to provide greater precision in the examination of childlessness
over time, Table 2 presents a series of
schedules of age-specific rates of childlessness by color and ethnic group for selected
time periods between 1910 and 1975. Data
for white women are included in the top
panel of the table, with data for nonwhite

Spanish surname)? women in the middle
and bottom panels, respectively.

The rates for white women vary considerably by age within any one time period,
as well as over time within any one age
group. In 1975, for instance, 58.4 per cent
of ever-married women in the group 15-19
years old are without children, while in
the same year, only 6.8 per cent of the
women 45-49 years old are childless.
These differences in age-specific rates are
also present in the other time periods investigated.

As noted, variability in rates of
childlessness is also evident over time in
any one age group. As few as 24.2 per cent
of ever-married women 20-24 years old
were childless in 1910; in 1975, as many as
45.1 per cent of women in this age group
were without children. Generally, the period rates show considerable change in
magnitude in any one age group between
1910 and 1975. In the younger age groups
of ever-married white women, there appear to be increases in the rates of
childlessness.

Turning next to nonwhite and Spanish
women (middle and bottom panels of
Table 2), we find that both groups show

we decided to rely on one classification throughout
our time periods. Hence, we developed estimates of
nonwhite childlessness rates for 1965, 1970, and
1975. Briefly, we employed a schedule of age-specific
ratios of Negro-to-nonwhite childlessness for each of
seven age groups, 15~19, 20-24, etc., for the year
1960. These ratios were then divided into the agespecific rates for Negroes for 1965, producing a
schedule of estimates of age-specific rates of
childlessness for nonwhites. Schedules of nonwhite
estimates were produced in the same manner for
1970 and for 1975. It should be noted, however, that
the Negro-to-nonwhite ratios of childlessness for
1960 were very close to unity. The lowest (0.9770)
was for age group 20-24. The highest (1.0422) was
for age group 40-44. Very minor adjustment in the
Negro rates was therefore necessary in producing the
nonwhite estimates.

2 Childlessness data are provided for Spanishsurname women living in the southwestern United
States for 1950 and 1960; for Spanish-heritage
women in the United States for 1970 and 1975. We
did not make any adjustments in these rates, principally because cohort analyses were not conducted for
these women.

patterns similar to those of the whites,
although the changes are not as pronounced. Nonwhite women within any
one age group have experienced fluctuating rates of childlessness between 1910
and 1975, although not generally to the
extent of the whites. Except for a few isoJated instances among the youngest
women in 1970 and 1975, nonwhites generally show declining age-specific rates of
childlessness between 1940 and 1975. The
rates for Spanish women show little
change, except in the oldest age groups.
Generally, they too are experiencing reductions in their age-specific rates.

A more systematic examination is possible with data on the amount of change in
childlessness. Table 3 presents percentage
change data in the age-specific rates of
childlessness between each of the time periods under investigation. Information is
provided for white women in the top panel
of the table. Between 1910 and 1940, there
were increases in all the age-specific rates
of childlessness. The intervals thereafter
have generally been characterized by declines, although this becomes less the case
as the time interval moves closer to the
present. For example, all of the white
age-specific rates declined between 1950
and 1960, and all but two declined between 1960 and 1965. However, between
1970 and 1975, four of the seven agespecific rates increased, and these increases were all at the youngest ages.

The general kinds of changes experienced by white women, notably the reductions in the age-specific rates, have
also occurred among nonwhite and
Spanish women (middle and bottom
panels of Table 3). Generally, the percentage decreases are somewhat greater
among the nonwhite women than among
the whites, primarily because the nonwhites had higher rates of childlessness in
the earlier years. Although data for only
three time intervals are available for the

Spanish women, their experiences are
more characterized by decreases than increases in the age-specific rates of
childlessness.

These analyses have relied on agespecific rates of childlessness, and seven
time periods (six time intervals) have been
examined. For the most part, all groups
have experienced decreases in their rates,
although there appears a tendency in recent time periods, especially among the
white women, for increases to occur in the
age-specific rates. However, there are certain problems in analyzing rates of
childlessness on a cross-sectional basis in
the manner we have followed to this point.
The major liability involves the fact that
we are not following the same persons
through time, but rather persons of the
same age groups. Additional and perhaps
more insightful information regarding

changes in childlessness behavior may be
provided with cohort analyses (cf. Price,
1974, and Hastings and Robinson, 1975).

The percentages in Table 2 permit an
examination of changes in childlessness for
six open cohorts of ever-married women,
each of which is identified by the year in
which its members were 15-19 years of
age, the first years in which there occurs a
potential for childbearing.* These are the
1940, 1950, 1960, 1965, 1970, and 1975
cohorts. Of course, only the 1940 cohort
has completed its fecundity period; the
remaining five cohorts are still in the
childbearing years.

We have plotted in Figure 1 the rates of

3 These cohorts are open cohorts. Women become
members as they marry. Once married, they retain
membership, irrespective of subsequent changes in
marital status. The cohort literature in demography
contains reference to open cohorts; see, for examples,
Price, 1968 and 1974.

childlessness for the six cohorts of white
women for as many time periods as there
are data available. The 1940 cohort began
its childbearing years (i.e., at age 15~19)
with a childlessness rate of slightly more
than 50 per cent. By the time the cohort
was in the last years of childbearing (i.e.,
ages 45~49), little more than 10 per cent of
its members were childless.

The 1950 and the 1960 cohorts, however, have not yet completed their
childbearing years, yet they are already (in
1975) at levels of childlessness lower than
that of the 1940 cohort. Less than 7 per
cent of the white women beginning
childbearing in 1950 (women who were
40-44 years of age in 1975) are childless,

 

and only 9 per cent of those beginning
childbearing in 1960 (women who were
30-34) are childless.

Cohorts beginning their childbearing
years after 1960 have been exposed to the
risk of fertility for a shorter period of time
than any of the cohorts just discussed.
However, their rates of childlessness so far
are higher than those of any of the earlier
cohorts when they were at similar ages.
The 1965 cohort is 25-29 years of age in
1975, and it has the highest rate of
childlessness at age 25~29 of any of the
cohorts preceding it. The experience of the
1970 cohort of ever-married women is one
typified by even higher rates of childlessness. Although this cohort is only 20-24

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

218

years of age in 1975, and therefore not far
along in its reproductive life cycle, more
than 45 per cent of its members are still
childless. By comparison, the 1965
cohort—a group of ever-married women
not characterized by especially low levels
of childlessness—was only 37 per cent
childless when it was 20-24 years of age.

Finally, the 1975 cohort is only at the
very beginnings of its fecund years, but its
rate of childlessness at this early age is the
highest of any of the U.S. cohorts for
which information is available. Nearly 60
per cent of its members are without children, a rate almost eight percentage points
higher than that of the 1940 cohort when it
was at the same age.

Among the cohorts of ever-married
white women examined in Figure 1, two
conclusions may be presented. First, the
oldest cohorts, and therefore those who
have completed all or most of their
childbearing years, have the lowest rates
of childlessness, the 1950 cohort exhibiting
the lowest rates of all. Second, the younger
cohorts of women (those beginning their
childbearing years in 1965, 1970, and
1975) do not appear to be following the
childlessness paths of the cohorts who preceded them. These younger cohorts of
ever-married women have significantly
higher rates of childlessness at each
age than any of the older cohorts at similar
stages in the reproductive cycle. Even if
the future trends in childlessness behavior
of these younger cohorts follow the same
slopes of the older cohorts (see Figure 1),
they will still result in considerably higher
rates of childlessness by the time these
younger women reach their fiftieth birthday than has already occurred for the
older cohorts.

The childlessness experiences of the
nonwhite cohorts of ever-married women
are not the same as those of the whites.

percentage rates of childlessness. The 1940
nonwhite cohort began with very high
levels of childlessness at ages 15-19 (although not as high as any of the white
cohorts) and ended its fecund years with
17 per cent of its members having no children. This is the highest level of childlessness at ages 45—49 of any of the cohorts of
white or nonwhite women examined in
this paper. Pre-1940 cohorts, however,
ended their childbearing years with levels
of childlessness higher than that of the
1940 nonwhite cohort, as the crosssectional data in Table 2 suggest (see also
Farley, 1970, p. 95).

Generally, the age-specific percentage
rates of childlessness for the post-1940
cohorts of ever-married nonwhite women
are lower than those for the 1940 cohort.
For example, at ages 25-29, almost 30 per
cent of the 1940 nonwhite cohorts was
childless; in contrast, less than 15 per cent
of the 1950 cohort, and 12 per cent of the
1960 cohort, were childless at ages 25-29.
As noted earlier, there is a tendency
among the white women for higher rates
of childlessness to occur among the
younger cohorts; this is not the case among
the nonwhite women. There is little evidence in Figure 2 that more childlessness
is occurring in the 1965, 1970, and 1975
cohorts, than in the pre-1965 cohorts. In
most cases, the rates of childlessness of the
younger cohorts are slightly less than, or at
about the same level as, the older cohorts.

INTERPRETATION

Our interpretation of childlessness
trends in the United States will concentrate on the experiences of the younger
cohorts of white women. However, we
first pay brief attention to the trends and
experiences of the older white women and
of all the nonwhite women.

Concerning the white women, our analyses generally show high levels of

childlessness for the 1940 cohort (see Figure 1) and even higher levels for the
cohorts preceding it. For example, the
cross-sectional data (in Table 2), along
with the studies of other demographers
(e.g., Grabill and Glick, 1959), suggest
that nearly 20 per cent of the cohort completing its childbearing in 1950 (i.e., the
1920 cohort) was childless. In contrast, the
1950 and 1960 cohorts have experienced
lower rates of childlessness than the earlier
cohorts. However, the most recent cohorts
(those of 1965, 1970, and 1975) show the
highest rates of childlessness of any of the
cohorts.

The very low rates reported for the 1950
cohort may be attributed, in part, to the

fact that these women passed through
their most fecund period (ages 15~29) during the post-World War II “baby boom.”
Hastings and Robinson (1975, pp. 181182) arrived at a similar conclusion when
their estimated proportions of childlessness for this cohort were lower than the
minimum levels reported in other studies.
Reexamination of Figure 1 indicates that
the sharpest decline in childlessness is for
this same cohort during the period 1950 to
1960; there was a decrease of more than 40
percentage points in the proportion of
childless women (from 55.4 per cent to
12.3 per cent). Moreover, these women
had their childbearing activities well
under way before the onset of the conDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

traceptive revolution of the 1960’s and
hence were not full participants. They
were entering the latter stages of
childbearing by 1965 when their rate of
childlessness was already at the relatively
low level of 9.7 per cent.

The 1955 fertility cohort (not included
in Figure 1; see Table 2, women aged
35-39 in 1975) entered the childbearing
years at the height of the “baby boom”;
their childlessness rates are the lowest reported for the entire sample, irrespective
of color or age. The 1950 fertility cohort
also experienced some residual effects of
the “baby boom” and was entering its
most fecund period just prior to the contraceptive revolution; hence, its low levels
of childlessness. The upper-right quadrant
of the “White Women” panel in Table 2
graphically depicts the results of these two
“period” effects—extremely low agespecific proportions of childlessness for
women who were fecund during the postwar years, yet who were too far along in
their childbearing to benefit from the “fertility control revolution.”

Nonwhite ever-married women of the
pre-1940 and 1940 cohorts show very high
rates of childlessness, and the cohorts
thereafter report fewer of their members to
be without children. The youngest nonwhite cohorts (those of 1965, 1970, and
1975) do not appear to be experiencing
higher rates than the 1950 and 1960
cohorts, as was the case among white
women. These trends for nonwhite wives
are different from those of the white wives
and hence need a post-hoc explanation of
another sort. Blacks, who comprise the
majority of the nonwhite sample, have
historically evidenced higher rates of
childlessness, by age group as well as in
the aggregate, than white wives. Reasons
for this differential are numerous and
complex, but may include higher rates of
venereal disease (Veevers, 1971, p. 291),
malnutrition, Jack of access to comprehensive medical care, and substandard

health levels (Bogue, 1969, pp. 724-729;
Farley, 1970, pp. 109~111; see also Kunz
and Brinkerhoff, 1969, for a related although less applicable statement). In other
words, the higher rates of childlessness
among Blacks have possibly been due
mainly to involuntary factors.

Trends in improved health conditions
and medical care after 1940 contributed to
the steady declines in childlessness observed for nonwhites, especially among
the older cohorts. However, a countertrend was underway at the same time
which may have offset the true impact of
improved health conditions on fertility.
This countertrend was the contraceptive
revolution, affecting both white and nonwhite wives. Farley (1970, p. 10) reports
that the proportion of married nonwhite
women using some method of birth control
increased from approximately 60 per cent
in 1960 to 75 per cent in 1965. What factors can account then for the relatively
lower rates of childlessness among the
youngest nonwhite cohorts? Farley (1970,
p. 244) presents some insights into this
trend. Despite the fact that there is little
difference by race in the reported number
of children desired or expected, there are
some fertility differentials. Fertility rates
are higher for Black women than for white
women in rural areas; they are also higher
for Blacks in the lower social and economic levels than they are for whites in
similar circumstances. Finally, Black
teenagers have traditionally had higher
fertility rates than whites. These fertility
patterns, coupled with the trend for
childlessness to vary inversely with fertility (Hastings and Robinson, 1975, p. 181),
would seem to contribute to the low levels
of childlessness reported for the nonwhite
sample. Although we do not provide a
cohort analysis of childlessness for Spanish
women, the cross-sectional data for them
suggest childlessness behavior similar to
that of the nonwhite women.

Our major concern is with providing an

interpretation for the increasing rates of
childlessness among the 1965, 1970, and
1975 cohorts of white ever-married women. As we have noted in the preceding
section, period and cohort data suggest
that the younger ever-married white
women are reporting higher rates of
childlessness than those who are older. It
is plausible to hypothesize that these
higher rates may be due in part to the
increasing incidence of voluntary
childlessness, namely, the decision between a wife and husband to remain without children.

It is often argued that most of the
childlessness occurring among’ U.S.
women since the 1940’s was due to involuntary sterility or subfecundity (Veevers, 1971; Gustavus and Henley, 1971). So
prevalent is this view that recent family
textbooks by Kephart (1966) and Landis
and Landis (1968), for example, provide
“an estimate of the incidence of childlessness {and then]. . . a discussion of factors
contributing to subfecundity and sterility,
thereby revealing an implicit assumption
that fecundity problems are the only cause
of childlessness, and that something
should be done to help the childless
couple” (Veevers, 19736, p. 199).

Recently, some _ investigators have
begun to pay more attention to the possibility that some couples will decide voluntarily to be childless (Pohlman, 1970; Veevers, 1971, 1972, 1973a, 1973b; Gustavus
and Henley, 1971; Poston, 1974, 1976),
and a modest literature is developing on
this topic. Furthermore, many would
agree that the current emergence of voluntary childlessness may be linked with
broader changes in the fabric of U.S. society regarding fertility control, contraceptive technology, sexual and family
norms, and female work patterns and
preferences. We examine this argument in
the paragraphs below in an attempt to
understand more fully the increasing rates
of childlessness among the young cohorts

Trends in Childlessness, 1910-1975

of white women discussed in the preceding
section.

The basic argument begins with the
market availability of the oral contraceptive in the early 1960’s and its rapid diffusion in the population. The rates of adoption were clearly unprecedented. Although
complex to measure precisely because of
the ambiguous nature of the “risk” population, one way of estimating its degree of
diffusion is by examining its use among
married U.S. women aged 15-44. Fifteen
per cent of this population used an oral
contraceptive in 1965, 22 per cent by 1970,
and over 25 per cent by 1975 (Westoff,
1976, p. 56; see Ryder, 1972, pp. 233-240
for another statement). These rates of acceptance were due to the significantly improved levels of contraceptive protection,
along with the fact that the oral contraceptive is sexually unobtrusive. Bumpass (1973, p. 67) has observed that
thereafter “significant proportions of the
population came to expect fertility control
to be both complete and unobtrusive.” He
also observed that it is “likely that the
rapid diffusion may be attributable as
much to the sexual unobtrusiveness of the
pill as to its greater efficacy. The ensuing
revolution in fertility, however, derives
from the latter.”

To quote Bumpass (1973, p. 67) at
length:

The essential characteristic of this revolution is that childbearing can now be voluntary in a radically different sense than ever
before. Under the previous fertility regime,
women could not confidently plan a lifetime
of childlessness, nor evén the prevention of
unwanted fertility. Obviously, some women
could and did avoid unwanted fertility but
no individual could be sure of that outcome
in advance. The most effective traditional
contraceptives markedly delayed and reduced in number accidental conceptions but
did not prevent these altogether. Among
women using such traditional methods to
prevent unwanted pregnancy, nearly half
failed within a five-year period (Ryder and
Westoff, 1965: 334), in part as a consequence
of the coital-relatedness of these methods.

222

The gestalt that accompanied this regime
was one in which the adult role expectations
of women were structured around motherhood, and the separation of work and
home in industrial society buttressed this role
structure. Cultural values with respect to
fertility were, in part, rationalizations of the
inevitable.

Although “the pill” set the revolution in
motion, it is a mistake to refer solely to
these changes as the “contraceptive revolution,” since as Bumpass has noted, the
alterations really involve a revolution in
fertility control values. The introduction
of the intrauterine device in 1965 was followed by an equally rapid diffusion among
the risk population (Ryder, 1972; Westoff,
1976). In the sixties and early seventies as
well, there have been dramatic changes in
the attitudes and behavior of the American population concerning receptivity to
male and female sterilization (Presser and
Bumpass, 1972). The attitudes of the U.S.
public with respect to abortion have also
altered dramatically since the mid-1960’s.
For example, Jones and Westoff (1972) report significant increases between 1965
and 1970 in the numbers of American
wives, by race and religion, approving
abortion for various reasons. These
changes may be as much a result of the
changes in fertility contro) values as they
are a response to concerns “with the role of
accidental pregnancy in limiting the
achievement of women” and with the poor
health consequences occurring with illegal
abortions (Bumpass, 1973, p. 68). And it
must be remembered that these attitudinal
changes favoring abortions occurred prior
to the Supreme Court decision of 1973.

Important for our understanding of the
increasing trends in childlessness is the
fact that the changing values of this fertility control revolution have legitimized and
have begun to make possible the realization of equal opportunity between the
sexes because nonfamilial roles for women
are now a realistic option. “The potential

Poston and Gotard

for complete fertility control makes
childbearing—when and if—a matter of
choice in an ultimate sense that never before existed. For the first time motherhood
itself is fully a matter for rational evaluation. Obviously childbearing roles offer
much that is rewarding, but these rewards
are not likely to be experienced equally by
all women... . [Motherhood has become a
competitor] with other social roles” (Bumpass, 1973, p. 68).

We have attempted to provide in some
detail the basic arguments concerning recent changes in fertility control, especially
as they relate to the question of childlessness. If the above reasoning is true and the
society is indeed experiencing a major
change in fertility control values, these
kinds of explanations are capable of accounting for the increases in childlessness
occurring in the United States in the late
1960’s and early 1970’s among the cohorts
of young white women. These arguments
suggest that much of the childlessness is
voluntary and that the increases have not
been due solely to increasing sterility and
subfecundity stemming from involuntary
factors.

Quite obviously, there are methodological and conceptual problems with
drawing inferences in this manner. Survey
and interview data, particularly the latter,
designed especially for identifying reasons
and justifications for voluntary childlessness would be most helpful. Materials of
this type would allow investigators to sort
out the extent to which changes in fertility
control values and related adjustments in
sexual and family norms and the roles of
women and motherhood are indeed linked
with the emergence of voluntary childlessness, Additional research similar to Veevers’ (1973a) in-depth analysis of voluntary
childlessness is necessary before we will
fully understand the recent emergence of
childlessness among the young cohorts of
white women in the United States.

SUMMARY

The purpose of this paper has been to
examine the trends in childlessness for
ever-married women in the United States
using a series of data assembled from assorted census materials. These data permit
period and cohort investigations of the
phenomenon for many time periods, from
1910 to 1975, for various color and ethnic
groups.

Whether examined at the period or
cohort level the incidences in rates of
childlessness have varied irregularly
through time. Cohort analysis of white
women indicate that the oldest cohorts
have the lowest rates of childlessness, especially those cohorts which began their
childbearing years during the post-World
War II “baby boom.” However, the
younger white cohorts (those beginning
their fecund period after 1965) show significantly higher rates of childlessness at
each age than any of the older cohorts at
similar stages in the reproductive cycle.

The trends of nonwhite women are not
the same as those of the white women.
Generally, the age-specific rates of
childlessness for the older cohorts are

223

higher than those of their white counterparts, and this difference may be attributed to involuntary factors. Secondly,
the younger nonwhite cohorts are reporting levels of childlessness at about the
same level, or slightly lower than the older
cohorts; thus they do not evidence the rise
in childless rates shown by the younger
white women.

We hypothesized that a major portion of
the increasing rates of childlessness for
younger white women may be attributed
to increases in voluntary childlessness
which are linked to broader changes in the
fabric of the society regarding fertility control, contraceptive technology, sexual and
family norms, and female work patterns
and preferences. We have suggested, in
accord with Bumpass (1973), that the
changing values of the fertility control
revolution have legitimized and have
begun to make possible the realization of
equal opportunity between the sexes because nonfamilial roles are now a realistic
option for women. This attitudinal and
behavioral change is likely a major factor
contributing to the increasing incidence of
childlessness among younger’ white
women in the United States.
