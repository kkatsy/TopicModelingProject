Deformed Nasal Septa and
Relaxed Selection: IT

Richard H. Post

Depariment of Human Genetics
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, Michigan

In a previous paper by this title (Post,
1966) deformities of the nasal septum were
described and classified. Two studies of the
frequencies of deformities in twins were reviewed, both yielding higher rates of concordance between identical pairs than between fraternal pairs, with resulting “‘heritability estimates” of 0.4 and 0.6; and the
frequencies of normal and abnormal septa
were reported in samples of skulls from 22
populations, aggregating 2,343 individuals.
Six of the skull samples were from populations described as “‘long civilized’”—two of
Chinese, two of recent Egyptians, and two of
Europeans. Most of the sixteen other samples were from simple paleolithic cultures
of hunters and food gatherers. The former
group of samples is contrasted with the
latter, on the whole, in having higher frequencies of deformed septa, particularly
of “marked” or exaggerated deformities.
Moreover, the relatively few skulls with
deformities classified as “‘very marked”’ are
almost all confined to the “Jong civilized”
group of samples,

Discussion of possible explanations of the
contrast in frequency of septal deformities
between the two groups of samples led to
the hypothesis that maladaptations with ge
 

netic components—always in a state of equilibrium between input flow (from mutations)
and selection—have not been eliminated
from post-paleolithic populations as effectively as from populations of more simple
habitats, due to a partial relaxation of the
rigors of natural selection concomitant with
the growth of culture.

The present paper comments on the
ontogeny and typology of septal deformities,
summarizes additional family studies, and
presents data on the frequencies of septal
deformities in samples of skulls from four additional populations: contemporary American colored and white, neolithic (late Stone
Age) white, and fairly recent Eskimo, All
four are subdivided by sex; all but the Eskimo are also subdivided by age, in five-year
classes. The samples of contemporary American colored and white are further classified
and analyzed by several morphological observations and measurements including bilateral asymmetry, trauma, dental malocclusion, and associated abnormalities. The
neolithic skulls provide a test of the hypothesis of relaxed selection by comparison
of the frequencies of septal deformities among
contemporary whites with the frequencies
among their ancestors some four to five
thousand years ago.

ONTOGENY AND TYPOLOGY OF SEPTAL
DEFORMITIES

The septal cartilage is a continuation into
adult life of the fetal or ‘‘primitive” septal
cartilage. All but the anterior part of this
cartilage disappears during early childhood
as the left and right lamellae of the perpendicular plates of the vomer become ossified.
The part of the septal cartilage which lies
between the lamellae is then absorbed, allowing the left and right membrane bones to
fuse, forming the septum of the adult skull.
Details are given in Hillenbrand (1933).
Evidence of the bilateral origin of the vomer
is demonstrated by the two alae and the intervening groove, which forms the superior

Social Biology

margin of the vomer, and into which the
septal cartilage fits. The anterior part of
the septum, which remains cartilaginous
throughout life, is almost never preserved in
adult skulls, whether disinterred or macerated.

The most frequent type of deformity in
adult skulls is a “shelf” or “ledge” of bone
projecting laterally and horizontally from
either the left or right side of the groove
which contains the septal nerve and accompanying vessels. Viewed from the front
of the skull, looking slightly downward into
the nasal orifice, the groove appears widest
at its anterior end, that is, the one closest to
the nasal spine. Posteriorly it tapers, to

or disease. American colored male, macerated. Terry Collection, Washington University, St. Louis. Cour

become fairly narrow at about one-quarter
to one-half, occasionally to three-quarters,
of its length, along the superior margin of
the vomer (Figs. 1 and 2). In the living, the
inferior margin of the septal cartilage lies in
and extends upward (anteriorly) from this
groove. Representing the groove in crosssection as a capital Y with very short, thin,
and cup-shaped arms, concave surfaces

directed upward and facing each other, the
deformity consists of one arm being longer
than the other and bent downward to become almost horizontal, intruding into the
nares. The resulting obstruction may impede air flow on that side (Figs. 3 and 4).
This deformity usually produces a bending,
bowing, warping, or buckling of the septum,
which impedes air flow even more.

In the second most frequent type of deformity, the lateral and horizontal projection of one of the arms of the Y-shaped
groove is restricted to a rather obtuse point,
forming what is often called a “spur.” A
large spur may protrude as much as a centi

meter, or even more, into the air passage.
The profile of the spur, if it could be viewed
in the sagittal plane of the skull from below
looking upward vertically, would appear as
a gently sloping hillock, becoming steeper
near the summit, the anterior slope always

in 3; it forms a typical spur in 4. Ethmoid bone is above the spur; vomer, below it.

the more gentle; the posterior, steeper
(Fig. 5).

Continuing the simile of a hillock, a spur
viewed from this aspect might be called a
pointed, steep hillock; a “edge” or ‘‘shelf,”’
a longer, more gently sloping one. When
viewed at right angles to this aspect but
again in the sagittal plane, that is, looking
into the nasal orifice full face, a spur can
hardly be distinguished from a ledge. From
this aspect the septum usually appears
bowed or warped, with the deformity on
the convex surface. The ethmoidal region of
the septum lies above the hillock, the vomerine region below it.

A third type of abnormal ossification,
rather rare, is a spur arising from one or the
other of the very shallow bilateral grooves
of the ethmoid which contain the left and
right spheno-palatine (naso-palatine) nerves
and companion vessels. Such a spur lies
slightly above the position of the first and
second types of abnormality.

In all three types, the bone of the summit
of the hillock is thickened, suggesting that
it may contain an accessory ossification center, or, probably more likely, that the ossification center of childhood may have become
abnormally overactive. The bony surface of
the septum is apt to be considerably rougher
on the convex than on the concave side,
which is usually notably smooth.

Occasionally in types one and two there
is a “crater” at the summit of the hillock.
The crater is rather circular in a spur, elongate or oval-shaped in a shelf. This crater is
actually a short section of the groove of the
superior margin of the vomer, which may
be envisioned by considering that the Y has
been bent over at about 90° to left or right
at a point just below the junction of its
arms. The superior part of the crater is
ethmoid bone; the inferior part, vomer.
The lower arm of the Y has grown horizontally to an abnormal degree, and the
ethmoid articulates with the upper arm instead of arising from the groove between
the arms, as would be normal (see Fig. 3).

HEREDITY AND ETIOLOGY

Two reports of almost identical deformities of the nasal septum in pairs of allegedly
monozygotic twins may be added to the
studies summarized in the previous paper,
those of Schwarz (1928) on 84 twin pairs and
Schnitzler (1933) on 61. Howie (1946)
describes cases of gross, severe septal deformities which were indistinguishable in
male twins aged 22. Reid (1946) describes a

chronic asthma and respiratory infections;
the latter, by severe and recurrent epistaxis.

Leicher (1929) studied septal deviations
in one hundred families, both parents and
their 288 offspring, all over age 16. He reported 90% of the offspring to be normal
when both parents were normal; 45% normal when one parent was normal and the
other had septal deformity; 20% when neither parent was normal, The most frequent

type of deformity was the ridge or ledge-like
form. Bending or buckling of the septum
without ridge, ledge, spur, or process was
rare.

Additional reports have been found which
attribute most septal deformities to what
might be termed constitutional or developmental factors. Hillenbrand (1933) concludes that septal deformities result from
maldevelopment of the vomer. Jackson and
Jackson (1959, p. 38-39) and Klaff (1956)
assert that the great majority seem to be developmental. Zuckerkand! (1882) explains

lar plates of the vomer, or, more rarely, of
the ethmoid, a conclusion with which the
present observations are in agreement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Contemporary American colored and
white. The excellent Terry Collection of
macerated “‘poorhouse” skulls and skeletons
of the Department of Anatomy, Washington
University, St. Louis,! was made available
through the kindness of Professor Mildred
Trotter. The unique advantages of this
collection include records on sex, age at

death, cause of death, often a photograph of
the cadaver, and various clinical and anthropological notes. All skulls of individuals
under the age of 50 and over the age of 60
were included, to give maximum contrast
between prime of life and older age, provided they had sufficient teeth to permit
observations on dental occlusion. American
colored female skulls were too few to warrant reporting. Total numbers examined,
including those with damaged septa, were:
white males, 183; white females, 88; and
colored males, 169.

European neolithic. Two hundred skulls
in three neolithic areas of Western and one
of Central Europe are reported as one series
since area frequencies of septal abnormalities are indistinguishable.

Neolithic of Egypt. Sixty-nine skulls from
three neolithic sites of Egypt were examined
at the Department of Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Medicine, University of
Cairo: (a) Archaic, from Kostal (Quostol),
Nubia, near the border of Sudan, a pastoral
culture with some agriculture, about 2000
B.c. (14 skulls); (0) Badarian, from the
Nile banks near Asyat, aneolithic (some
copper artifacts), about 3500 B.c. (22
skulls); (c) Early Predynastic (33 skulls).
Skulls of the first and third groups are usually large and dolichocephalic with highbridged noses and no evidence of Negroid
admixture like that observed in nearly all
of the Badarian skulls. Sex was noted as
marked on the skull, in all cases acceptable.
The Egyptian skulls are reported as one
series, as are the European neolithic skulls,
since the three subsamples are indistinguishable in the frequency of septal abnormalities.

Eskimo. Forty-eight male and _ thirtyseven female Eskimo skulls were examined
in the large collections at the U.S. National
Museum in Washington. They are from
western Alaska—St. Lawrence Island, the
Seward Peninsula, Golofin Bay, Norton

Bay, and Point Hope, in approximately
equal numbers.

The procedure and standards of classification into four classes, described previously
(Post, 1966), were followed for deformities
of the inferior osseous (vomerine) and superior osseous (sphenoid) regions of the septum, namely: normal and slightly, markedly, and very markedly abnormal. Observa~
tions of the cartilaginous region were
discontinued. Data on normal and abnormal
septa in the above-described populations are
given in Tables 1, 2, and 3.

A test sample of sixty-two skulls which
had been classified two years previously
was examined anew and reclassified in all
three regions with only 4% error.

POPULATION COMPARISONS

Comparisons in the frequencies of septal
deformities between population samples of
the present study and those reported in the
previous paper (Post, 1966, Tables 2 and 3)
require pooling of the sexes, since sex was
not designated in the latter. The sexes are
fairly equally represented except for the
American colored, which are all male. The
percentages of deformed septa, in ascending
order, are shown in Table 4.

These frequencies are fairly consistent
with the previous frequencies, as shown in
Table 5 by the selections of samples from
Tables 2 and 3 of the earlier study. Scanning
the data from both present and previous
compilations, Eskimos have the lowest rates
of abnormal septa; contemporary American
whites and Europeans, the highest. American colored are intermediary, as are European and Egyptian neolithics.

The numbers and frequencies of deformities (three classes) in the samples of five
populations here reported for the first time,
subdivided by sex, are presented in summary form in Table 1. Details of the present
samples of contemporary American colored
and white are presented and discussed be

low. Data on the European neolithic samples, subdivided by sex, age and locality, are
presented in Table 2.

To these data may be added the results of
recent examinations of overall septal deformity in any region (see Table 6). While
not directly comparable with the above,
since many skulls are deformed in both
vomerine and ethmoidal regions, they contribute toward establishing the dichotomy
of “civilized” versus “primitives.” The
skulls were examined in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. They
are presented more fully in Table 3.

Although population differences are distinguished clearly by these data, no statistics can reflect their full dimensions and
depth. By examining the septa of any two
of these population samples together, or in
immediate sequence, one ascertains a still

Social Biology

greater magnitude of population difference.
The most distinctive septa are those of the
Eskimos and Aleuts, with extremely rare deformities, all of the lowest degree. Their
regularity of form is striking, to the point of
monotony. In greatest contrast are the septa
of contemporary whites, whether European
or American, almost all misformed to at
least a tiny degree, insufficient for recording.
They exhibit the highest frequencies of
“slightly abnormal” deformities, with unrivalled frequencies of ‘‘very marked”
cases. But again, no statistics could reflect
the enormous variety of the deformities,
their bizarre and grotesque natures, each
form unique, yet all so obviously without
function. Other populations are intermediary between these two extremes, the American Indians being closer to the Eskimo and
Aleuts, with relatively rare and moderate

closer to the whites.

Four references from medical literature
to racial differences in the frequency of septal deformities may be added to those cited
in the previous paper. Ballenger (1959,
p. 38) notes that septal deformities are
less frequent among Negroes than whites.
Keogh (1952, p. 90) asserts that ‘‘most
writers agree that deflection of the nasal
septum is commoner in civilized peoples
than in savage races.”’ Zuckerkandl (1892)

comments on their relative infrequency
among non-European races. St. Clair
Thomson (1926) estimates frequencies of
75% among Europeans, contrasted with
great rarity among ‘‘primitives,” including
notably the ‘red’? (American) Indian. The
last two authors interpret this contrast as
evidence against the trauma theory of the
origin of septal deformities. One of the
studies mentioned previously should be
cited again. Talbot (1894, p. 251-293)
examined 7,600 British skulls, of which
5,762 (76%) showed marked septal deformities; among 687 ancient Peruvian skulls
only 147 possessed deformed nasal septa

(21%).

ASSOCIATED ABNORMALITIES AND
FEATURES

Questions have arisen about possible associations between septal abnormalities

Social Biology

and other abnormalities of the face or crani
um that might provide clues for explaining

their basic origins. Therefore, each of the
macerated skulls from the Washington

University collection was inspected and

scored for evidence of trauma (1), asymme
try in three regions (2-4), and any other
type of osteological abnormality observed in
the face or nasal aperture (5). Four anthropometric measurements were made: upper
facial height; nasal length; diameter and
length of tear duct (lacrimal canal), right
side only (6-9). Skulls were also examined
and classified for three anatomical features

(traits) which vary widely, usually within

normal limits, but occasionally exceed these

limits sufficiently to be considered abnormal

(10-12); and for six features under the ru
bric “‘dental occlusion” (13-18). These 18

features were selected as possible sources of

clues for suggesting explanations of the
causes of septal deformities. They were
selected, after consultation, from sources
which included medical literature and comments received from readers of the previous
paper.
1. Trauma—of any bone of the face.
2-4. Asymmetry—scored separately for
(a) nasal sill; () sides of nasal aperture; (c) nasal bones.
5. Additional osteological abnormality,
if any observed.
6. Upper facial height (nasion to prosthion).
7. Nasal length (nasion to nasal spine).
9. Tear ducts—diameter of external
aperture and length of duct, right
side only (Post, 1969).

10. Height of nasal bridge (low, average,

high, very high).

11. Height of palate (same 4 classes).

12. Development of palatine torus (same

4 classes).

13-18. Dental occlusion—(a) categories of
relationship of upper first molar to
lower, left side, as proposed by Angle
(Anderson, 1960; Schull and Neel,
1965, section 10.3); (6) ditto, right
side; (c) overbite; (d) overjet; (e)
crossbite; (f) crowding of teeth, upper
and/or lower jaw.

Vol. 16, No. 3

Skulls were scored for these abnormalities
at the same time as for septal abnormalities.
About 10% were scored a second time, at
separate sessions, as spot tests of accuracy.
The four anthropometric measurements
and scores for observations on palate height
and molar malocclusion were found to be
quite accurate, as might be expected, since
maxillary and mandibular molars can be
juxtaposed with precision in the skull. If
too many teeth were missing to permit
reasonable certainty, the skull was bypassed. Scores for asymmetry and trauma
were least accurate, but not unsatisfactorily
so. Four categories were employed in scoring: normal and slightly, markedly, and
very markedly abnormal.

Association tables were made for the purpose of comparing the variation data for
each of these eighteen features (traits) with
those for the four classes of septal normality
or abnormality. Vomer and ethmoid were
scored separately. Association tables were
made for each of the following five subsamples, distinct in race, sex and age, viz:

a) 102 colored males, 15-40 (“‘younger”);
6) 67 colored males, 60 and over (“older’’);
c) 88 white females, 25-50 and over (“older’’);

d) 93 white males, 15-50 (“younger’’);
e) 90 white males, 60 and over (‘‘older’’).

Of the 180 resulting tables (18 X 2 X 5),
only one showed an association of statistical
significance—that between vomer and facial
asymmetry among “‘younger”’ white males.
The results of combining the three classes of
facial asymmetry into one class are shown in
Table 7. In the remaining 179 tables no association was revealed greater than might be
expected by chance alone. Pooling of any
two or more of the five subsamples would
not be justified since they are not homogeneous, due to differences of age, sex, or race.
Examination of the individual skulls which
exhibited septal deformity together with
another abnormality or extreme variation
was unavailing.

Deformed Nasal Septa

191

In conclusion, since no other explanation
has been found for septal deformities, they
are tentatively attributed to excessive ossification of one or the other of the paired
lamellae of the vomer, or, occasionally, of
the ethmoid. This is believed to produce the
bowing or deviation of the septum, which in
the living is almost always more clearly
manifest than the ridge or spur itself, but
which usually is secondary to it. The primary abnormality is best observed in skulls.
The basic cause is genetic control—or malcontrol—of ossification.

Additional material for a small side study
of the relationship between septal abnormality and malocclusion of molar teeth was

obtained from frontal head radiographs of
Japanese children fully described and reported by Schull and Neel (1965). Complete records of the material, stored at the
Department of Human Genetics of the
University of Michigan, were kindly made
available by these authors. Septal abnormalities were appraised subjectively from
the radiographs, with the same criteria and
definitions as for the skull (Post, 1966,
p- 102, 104), by the amount of protrusion
into or blocking of the left or right air passage due to a ridge or spur of bone, disregarding abnormalities of soft tissue. Septa
were classified as normal, possibly abnormal,
or decidedly abnormal. Among the 356

192 Post

cephalograms examined, all of children aged
10 and 11, only 36 (10%) were placed in the
last category. This frequency of decidedly
abnormal septa is lower than expected from
skull samples of adult Caucasians, most of
whose frequencies are over twice as high.
The difference is attributable partly to the
limitations of X-ray photography, possibly
also to racial differentiation, but mostly to
the subjects’ immaturity, since ossification
of the vomer is not complete until puberty.

*From Ali, 1965.

Among the 36 children with decidedly
abnormal septa, 31 or 86% had normal
molar occlusion, as determined by direct
examination. In contrast, among 2,911
children whose parents were not related,
pooling the sexes and including cases of abnormal and normal septa (which were not
examined), 1,252 or 43% had normal occlusion (Schull and Neel 1965, p. 231, Table
10.2). These results do not indicate an association between septal abnormality and
dental malocclusion.

DIFFERENCES OF AGE, SEX, RACE,
AND ANTIQUITY

Increased frequency of septal deformities
with age has been demonstrated by Ali
(1965). School children, students of various
ages, and adults (all patients in Iraqi clinics) were examined by anterior rhinoscopy
as part of ear, nose, and throat procedure,
excluding cases of diseased patients. The fre
Social Biology

quencies of deformed septa rose from 23%
under age 5 to 53% at ages 10-20, and to
85% at ages over 25 (see Table 8).

Ali (1965) attributes septal deformity to
developmental factors and comments on
their tendency to be familial. It is clear from
his results that observations of septal deformity should include record of age. Ali
found no sex difference in their frequency,
and he makes no comment on the bilateral
differences which he reports (see Table 9).
It would appear from this study that age
is an important factor through early adult
years, but much less important beyond the
third decade.

In the present study, age differences in
the frequencies of septal deformities could
be estimated only among the contemporary
male skulls, since too few female skulls of

(60 and over) and “younger” skulls (15-40
for American colored males and 15-50 for
American white males) give conflicting results as can be seen in Table 10. The differences are small, and even the largest difference (5.9%) is of no statistical significance.
Males have a slightly higher frequency of
deformities than females in all three comparisons (Table 11).

Race difference is marked. The American
colored male skulls have lower frequencies of
deformities than the American whites, at
both age levels (see Table 12).

Neolithic skulls have clearly lower frequencies than modern American skulls of
corresponding sex. The Egyptian neolithic
skulls were too few in number to justify
making estimates of statistical significance,
but the differences are sizable (see Table
13).

The lower frequencies of septal deformities about four or five thousand years ago
(some 160 to 200 generations) in an ancestral population is noteworthy, representing
very rapid change.

DISCUSSION

The relaxed selection hypothesis arose
from population comparisons, as described
earlier. Among “primitive” populations,
septal deformities of the skull are rare, under
18% (in the inferior osseous region, or
vomer). There are three exceptions: 72
Dakota Indians, 36%; 77 Illinois Indians,
27%; 27 Australian aborigines, 26%. In
contrast, 27% to 67% of “long civilized”
samples are deformed. Males have higher
rates than females, and older age is a factor.
It is believed that all the samples represent
septal defect fairly, without selectivity,
since persons who died from or with septal
defects have never been buried separately
from others, All are believed to have little
or no white ancestry, and to reflect ‘‘primitive’’ diet.

The hypothesis comes to mind also from
clinical observations. A typical listing and
classification of symptoms of deformed septa
is found in Heatley (1937): (a) mild deformity—no symptom; (0) marked deformity—vasomotor disturbances, frequent colds,
low catarrh, either chronic or recurrent,
which often leads to otitis media, tinnitis,
loss of hearing, and perhaps to a loss of
sense of balance; (c¢) severe deformity—any of
the above to elevated degrees, plus chronic
mouth breathing, which diminishes the
efficiency of the nose in warming and moistening inhaled air. This in turn leads to a less
than normally moistened pharynx, producing recurrent infections of the throat and
sinuses, frequently with diminished acuity
of taste and smell.

The selective disadvantage of chronic
mouth breathing is effectively demonstrated
by subjects on all-day hikes, even at leisurely paces. If hurried, such as by fear of hunger or enemies, on flights of several days—
not unusual for paleolithic people—the results can be easily imagined. Short sprints
are of course a minor consideration. The
penalties of mouth breathing become acute

Vol. 16, No. 3

in subfreezing temperatures. And the penalties of failure to keep pace during critical
flights under primitive conditions are unequivocal, The best testimonials of the above
are given by out-of-doors people such as
trappers, timber cruisers, guerilla warfare
trainers and trainees, and even by ethnologists, if sufficiently experienced in the field.

Evidence of genetic multifactorial components in abnormal ossification of the
septum is strong and consistent, but cannot
yet be called “proof,” since family histories
and twin resemblances may reflect common
environments as well as common inheritances. Environmental explanations of septal deformities have been sought wherever
suspected—in trauma, anatomically associated deformity, maldevelopment and extreme variation—so far without a clue. But
no field is won by default.

It may be significant that septal deformities are abnormal not only quantitatively,
such as extremes of stature or weight, but
also qualitatively. They are in no sense misdirected adaptations, nor super-adaptations; even those of mildest degree are distinctly maladaptive misfits, ‘‘evolutionary
nonsense.”

The factor of racial heredity as such is
discounted, first, by the wide variety of
racial samples with either high or low rates
of deformities. Possibly the higher frequencies among Caucasians and some Mongoloids in contrast with many “primitives”
may be related in part to the greater reduction in size of the face and jaws of the former, especially the pre-maxilla. This reduction is associated with their greater crowding of the teeth. However, no association

Deformed Nasal Septa

195

was found within any sample of American
whites or colored between dental crowding
and nasal-septum deformity. The factor of
race as such is discounted also by the low
rates among neolithic Egyptians and Europeans, in contrast with the high rates among
contemporary samples of the white race.

In conclusion, it must be admitted that
the frequencies of deformed septa among
contemporary whites seem very high for explanation by evolutionary (genetic) change
due to relaxed selection alone, during the
short interval of time since the neolithic.
The same might be said for dental malocclusion and several other situations. Five thousand years represent only about two hundred generations. The mutation rate of a
deleterious gene would have to be high to
produce so rapid a change in the frequency
of a trait controlled at a single locus, such as
red or green color blindness. But lower rates
would suffice for a multifactorial trait.
