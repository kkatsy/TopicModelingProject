Recent research has suggested a direct
relationship between the demographic structure of a population and the operation of
evolutionary forces. Consequently, studies
of demographic dynamics and social organization are recognized as necessary prerequisites for the understanding of the
genetic differentiation of human populations. The importance of an_ historical
perspective for demographic and genetic
observations has been emphasized by a
number of workers who have interpreted
the evolutionary implications of historical
fluctuations in population structure, size,
breeding patterns, and movement in various
geographic areas and contexts (Bailit,
Damon, and Damon, 1966; Benoist, 1964;
Bonné, 1963, 1966; Cavalli-Sforza et al.,
1969; Dobson and Roberts, 1971; Eaton
and Mayer, 1953; Fitch and Neel, 1969;

Boyce, and Harrison, 1967; Laughlin,

1964; Niswander et al., 1970; Oliveira and
Salzano, 1969; Roberts, 1971; Spuhler and
Clark, 1961; Ward and Neel, 1970.)

The present study, one segment of an
ongoing population genetics investigation
of Indian and Mestizo populations of Tlaxcala, Mexico, attempts to ascertain from

historical records and biological data the
rate and degree of genetic admixture between Indian and Spanish populations which
began in 1519. The formal genetic analyses
conducted by Crawford et al. (ms.) have
disclosed that a considerable portion of the
present Tlaxcalan gene pool may be of
Spanish origin, even though relatively few
Spaniards resided in the state during and
after the military conquest of Mexico. The
primary purpose of this paper is to outline
some of the historical and demographic
factors involved in this extensive admixture
process. A major objective of the present
approach is to reconstruct the numerical
effects of historical events on the population of the state of Tlaxcala, and to provide
an in-depth analysis of one representative
village, San Bernardino Contla. The genetic
and evolutionary consequences of specific
historical occurrences are discussed in the
light of a comparison of the demographic
features of Tlaxcalan populations in earlier
time periods with recent Indian and Mestizo populations investigated by Halberstein
and Crawford (1972) in two regions of
Tlaxcala.

Tlaxcala is the smallest state in Mexico,
with an area of approximately 4,400 square
kilometers and a population of 454,000.

The state occupies the central and northern
parts of the Tlaxcala-Pueblan Valley in the
southern zone of the central Mexican highlands, and it is geographically separated
from the Valley of Mexico by volcanoes
and mountain ranges on the western boundary. Tlaxcala is comprised of 44 municipios,
or independent political subdivisions.

OF

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Aspects of the demographic history of
the state of Tlaxcala in general, and San
Bernardino Contla in particular, are reconstructed from several published sources:
accounts by historians, such as Camargo
(1948), Bernal Diaz (1556, 1568), Prescott (1843), and Gibson (1964, 1967);
religious documents by Mendieta (1945)
and Motolinia (1969); and the anthropological research conducted in the Tlaxcalan
area over the past fourteen years by Nutini
(1961, 1965, 1968, ms.). Colonial census
materials, located in the archives of the
City of Tlaxcala, provided information on
population size at fifty-year intervals between 1531 and 1839.

Historical-Demographic Analysis of Tlaxcala 41

The contemporary populations analyzed
are a large Indian municipio, San Pablo
del Monte, and a Mestizo population in
the city of Tlaxcala. Demographic data
were collected through a standardized questionnaire administered to 350 informants,
both in public health clinics and through
door-to-door interviews. Information was

obtained for 3,575 living and deceased consanguinal relatives from these populations.
The principal demographic variables which
are described and compared by computer
cross-tabulations include population structure and movement, mate selection, age at
marriage, differential fertility, and mortality (Halberstein and Crawford, 1972).

ETHNOHISTORY OF TLAXCALA

Archeological evidence indicates that
pre-contact settlements in Tlaxcala were
situated on bluffs and valley walls, thus
avoiding the ill-drained lowlands (Snow,
1969). The Spanish were largely responsible for the establishment of habitations
on the valley floor with the drainage of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

42,

the lowlands and the introduction of improved tilling implements. According to
Camargo (1948), the original inhabitants
of Tlaxcala were Olmec and Zacatecan
tribes. These groups were conquered by
Nahuatl-speaking Teochichimec peoples
who invaded from the north in the fourteenth century and forced the aboriginal
residents into peripheral zones surrounding
the state. These Nahuatl speakers, later
known as Tlaxcalans, formed the communities encountered by Cortes in 1519.

There is conflicting opinion as to the
exact dimensions of the pre-contact Tlaxcalan republic. Gibson (1967, pp. 6-10)
estimates that the total area of the four
principalities of the old republic of Tlaxcala
(in existence until 1519) was smaller than
the present state. Cook and Simpson (1948,
p. 36) and Nutini (1968), however, contend that there is a close correspondence
between the borders of the old republic and
the Tlaxcala of today. The latter author
reports that Tlaxcalans have always maintained a high degree of ethnic unity and
territorial integrity.

Gibson (1967, p. 15) and Prescott (1843,
Vol. I, p. 412) state that the Tlaxcalans had
become unified, traditional enemies of the
Aztecs of Central Mexico by 1519. They
point out that when the Tlaxcalans confronted the invading Spaniards, they were
already sensitized to external threats from
the militaristic Aztecs, led by Montezuma
and his predecessors. The Tlaxcalan army,
however, reacted to the advancing Spanish
forces with disorganized, and mostly unsuccessful, resistance. Bernal Diaz (1556,
p. 121), a chronicler and one of the conquerers, writes that only twenty-three days
passed between the crossing of the Tlaxcalan border and the victory march into
the capital city. He refers to just two
major battles between Spanish and Tlaxcalan troops, followed by consultation and
negotiations which resulted in the forma

tion of an alliance against the Aztecs
known as the Segura de la Frontera.
Bernal Diaz (1568, p. 269) describes the
treatment of the Spaniards by the Tlaxcalans after the treaty was established:
“We were hospitably received and entertained in their cities after our fatigues,
dangers, and losses in the retreats from
Mexico.” Gibson (1967, p. 89) and Prescott (1843, Vol. III, p. 249) note that as
a reward for their military assistance and
other services, the Tlaxcalans were granted
a considerable measure of freedom and
autonomy following the Conquest. Cook
and Borah (1971, pp. 19-20) indicate that
Tlaxcalans were also allowed sizeable exemptions in their colonial taxes and tributes.
According to the archives, the Spaniards
assumed an administrative role in three
major cities: Tlaxcala, Santa Ana Chiautempan, and Huamantala. Since the state
of Tlaxcala is located on the direct route
which Spanish soldiers travelled from the
east coast of Mexico to the Aztec capital
Tenotchtitlan, many transient Spanish officials, assistants, and infantrymen could be
found in the state throughout the entire
war period and until 1750 (Nutini, ms.).

POPULATION TRENDS IN THE STATE OF
TLAXCALA, 1519-1970

At the time of the arrival of the Spanjards in 1519, the population of Tlaxcala
numbered approximately 300,000, but by
1531 it had diminished to 250,000 inhabitants (see Fig. 2). In 1556 Viceroy Velasco
ordered a statewide census. An examination of this document revealed that 196,703
residents were counted in that year, and
that the average household consisted of
6.2 persons. By 1575 the population had
decreased further to 150,000, and immediately preceding the turn of the seventeenth
century Tlaxcala reached its lowest population level—100,000. Thus, in 81 years
(1519-1600) the population was reduced

by two-thirds, with an average decrease of
approximately 2,500 per year. From 1600
to 1823 the population underwent a gradual but steady increment (averaging 450
per year) to 200,000, but was still only
two-thirds of the size of the pre-contact
population. The latest recorded date for
the influx of Spanish administrators is
1750; 1823 marks the official termination
of the colonial supervision of Tlaxcala.
Between 1830 and 1920 the population level
rose at an average rate of 1,100 per
year, finally approaching its pre-Hispanic
strength of 300,000. Thus, the initial loss
of two-thirds of the population in the 81
years from 1519 to 1600 was not replaced
until more than three centuries later. The
state of Tlaxcala has continued to increase
numerically, with a population of 346,699
in 1960 (America en cifras, 1970, p. 31),
and an estimated 454,000 at present
(Paxton, 1970, p. 1143).

It is evident from Figure 2 that disease
epidemics were in part responsible for the
rapid depopulation of Tlaxcala in the sixteenth century. The widespread smallpox
epidemics of 1519 and 1532 are attributed
by Bernal Diaz (1568) to single carriers.
The disease designated “plague,” which

according to Sahagun (1938, Vol. III,
p. 303; Vol. IV, p. 122) struck in 1520
and 1585-1588, was probably a generalized
and contagious bacteria] infection (Cockburn and Crawford, ms). Gibson (1967,
p. 138) reports that “plague” flared up
at ten-year intervals between 1519 and
the end of the sixteenth century. In the
same respect, the “cholera” discussed by
Mendieta (1945) and cited by Gibson
(1967, p. 138) was probably an acute,
communicable gastro-intestinal disorder
which claimed many lives. Measles rose to
epidemic proportions in both 1530 and
1595 (Mendieta, 1945; Nutini, ms.).
Cockburn and Crawford (ms.) discovered
that typhus was prevalent in Tlaxcala from
1560 to 1600, with sporadic recurrences
until the introduction of preventive measures in recent years.

At least three sizeable emigrations
affected the population of Tlaxcala between 1519 and 1650, Prescott (1843,
Vol. II, pp. 66, 393) writes that in 1519
Cortes enlisted some 6,000 Tlaxcalan warriors for a major drive into Aztec territory
and that this contingent exhibited a considerable depletion upon its return in 1520.

describe a major colonizing effort by the
Spaniards in 1591 which involved the
emigration of 401 Tlaxcalan families drawn
from all four principalities of the republic.
The migrants were relocated to four new
villages in the north near San Luis Potosi
and Saltillo and to two additional locations
to the west of Tlaxcala. According to

authorities brought into the Valley of
Mexico many Tlaxcalans who were obligated to contribute labor between 1637
and about 1650.

POPULATION TRENDS IN SAN
BERNARDINO CONTLA, 1519-1970

San Bernardino Contla, a large, predominantly Indian municipio in south-central
Tlaxcala, was selected for a microscopic
analysis of demographic changes in Tlaxcala

The pre-Conquest population of the village in 1519 was approximately 6,800, and
the Velasco census of 1556 recorded 4,290
residents. In 1627 the size of San Bernardino Contla reached its lowest point, 1,871.
Thus, in 108 years the population dwindled
to about one-fourth of its previous level in
1519. During the period from 1720 to 1800
some outward migrations occurred due to
dissatisfaction with internal political affairs. Between 1820 and 1823 self-government and independence were restored. The

90 years from 1850 to 1940 witnessed a
steady growth of the population until it
approached its pre-Hispanic size of 6,800.
Therefore, the initial reduction in population level over 108 years (1519-1627) was
not replenished until 313 years later (1940).
The population of San Bernardino Contla
continued to increase in the three subsequent decades, with 7,900 inhabitants in
1950; 10,058 in 1960; and 11,010 in 1970,
It appears that a new level of numerical
equilibrium has been established in the
past ten years, since population growth
has become relatively stabilized.

FERTILITY STUDIES

Some data on fertility patterns in San
Bernardino Contla were included in the
more complete government censuses. The
largest samples of married women were
available in the 1786 and 1839 records.
Table 1 outlines the trends of fertility for
those years.

or moved away, and thus the actual levels
of achieved reproduction are probably
somewhat higher.

Reproductive behavior in Indian and
Mestizo populations of Tlaxcala in 1969
was investigated by Halberstein and Crawford (1972), utilizing a demographic proforma. Table 2 reveals that the recent
populations exhibit much higher overall
statistics for mean number of living offspring and variance in progeny number for
all married women, as well as for those past
age forty.

POPULATION STRUCTURE

Population pyramids with age and sex
breakdowns were constructed from the
available census materials for 1786 and
1839 in San Bernardino Contla, using
samples of individuals for whom exact ages
were reported, (see Fig. 4). Both of the
population pyramids have broad bases, suggesting that, despite the indication of low

The mean number of living offspring per
prolific female for 1786 and 1839 is low
(2.9 and 2.36, respectively), compared to
the figures for present Indian communities.
Variance in number of progeny per female
is likewise low. Relatively high sterility
rates were found for married women past
forty years of age. It must be pointed
out that the censuses did not provide information on those children who had died

seen that these pyramids are generally
comparable to the earlier San Bernardino

SPANISH GENE FLOW INTO TLAXCALA

Published accounts of the number of
Spaniards who entered Tlaxcala in Conquest times have been quite vague. Gibson
(1967, p. 79), for example, reports a
“steady infiltration of Spanish colonists
into Tlaxcala in the late sixteenth century.”
Other literary references are similarly imprecise in the enumeration of Spanish
soldiers and administrators. However, documents from the Tlaxcala Archives contained
estimates of the number of Spaniards in
residence for three dates in the three main
administrative centers of the state. These
are summarized in Table 3.

The maximum number of Spaniards who
brought families with them into Tlaxcala
was approximately 400, and, at any given
time during the colonial period, as many
as 200 transient Spaniards were in the
state, concentrated mainly in the cities
which housed the administration. 1750
marks the final date of the entrance of
Spanish settlers and the closure of the
state to gene flow from outside Mexico
(Nutini, ms.).

DISCUSSION

The present findings may be theoretically
important for the analysis of the microevolution of Tlaxcalan populations. In several respects, the invasion of the Spanish
into Tlaxcala is one historical event with
far-reaching demographic, genetic, and
evolutionary consequences.

The most striking feature of the hisDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

torically reconstructed populations of the
state of Tlaxcala and the village San
Bernardino Contla is the “bottleneck” in
population size after 1519, a result of the
rapid decline to one-third of the previous
population level of the state by the end
of the sixteenth century. The devastating
epidemic diseases which occurred immediately following the first contact with Spaniards and the large-scale emigrations of
Tlaxcalans in 1519 and 1591 sharply reduced the effective breeding population.
Roberts (1968) and Gajdusek (1964) have
suggested that such demographic conditions
are favorable for the disruptive action of
genetic drift. Two factors, however, may
have minimized the chances of drift:
(a) the population of the state was still
100,000 at its lowest point; and (0) gene
flow into Tlaxcala continued throughout
the depopulation period. Lasker (1952,
1960) has pointed out that gene flow and
admixture may tend to counteract the
random effects of drift.

The opportunity for rapid evolutionary
change by natural selection might also have
been enhanced in Tlaxcala in colonial times.
If certain genotypes were more resistant
than others to the epidemic diseases, the
likelihood of differential survival and reproduction would have been suddenly increased. Reconstruction of the fertility rates
from census records for 1786 and 1839
indicate that achieved reproduction and
variance in offspring number were lower
in those two samples in comparison with
the living Indian and Mestizo populations
of 1969. Sterility rates for females who had
completed their fertile periods were higher
in the 1786 and 1839 San Bernardino
Contla populations than in the communities
examined in 1969. Population structure
for each of these three different samples
appears similar, however; in each case the
broad-based pyramid may reflect the continuous operation of natural selection

Social Biology

through differential mortality. Infectious
diseases have historically constituted a
prominent selective force among Tlaxcalan
populations (Cockburn and Crawford,
ms.). Pneumonia and gastroenteritis were
discovered to be the most frequent causes
of death in the recent Indian and Mestizo
populations, especially in the younger age
groups (Halberstein and Crawford, 1972).
Thus, the opportunity for selection through
disease vectors has persisted in Tlaxcala
to the present.

The present data contain several implications that may elucidate the process of
genetic admixture between Spaniards and
Tlaxcalan Indians. In comparison to the
total population of the state, relatively
few Spaniards actually entered and remained permanently. Throughout the
colonial period most of the Spanish immigrants, especially those who brought
families and established residence, were
localized in certain towns. It is known that
many transient soldiers and officials filtered
in and out of Tlaxcala at least until 1750.
Considering the small number of administrators, their genetic contribution to subsequent Tlaxcalan populations is disproportionately large. Crawford and his associates
(1972) have employed five statistical
approaches in order to estimate the amount
of admixture between Spaniards and Indians in Tlaxcala: least squares; multiple
regression analysis; a summation of Bernstein’s M, weighted by variance; the
methods of Roberts and Hiorns (1965);
and two tests of maximum likelihood, one
based on alleleic frequencies and the other
on phenotypic frequencies. The authors
have found that more than 30% of the
genes in the present Mestizo gene pool of
the city of Tlaxcala may be of Spanish
origin. This estimate is quite high, and
it may be the result of several interrelated
demographic circumstances: (a) the rapid
depopulation of the state was coupled with
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

Vol. 20, No. I

the extensive segregation of “Spanish”
genes; (0) the city of Tlaxcala was established by Spaniards as an administrative
capital, and thus the founding proportion
of “Spanish” genes was probably greater
there than in other regions of the state;
(c) the settlement patterns of the Spaniards
were highly centralized; and (d) Spanish
contact with the city of Tlaxcala endured
for some 250 years.

CONCLUSION

Through the use of cultural materials,
religious sources, and historical vital statistics, the demographic dynamics of Tlaxcala,
Mexico from 1519 to 1970 are reconstructed
and applied to biologically derived models
of hybridization between Spanish and Indian populations. The Spanish occupation
of Tlaxcala in 1519 resulted in pronounced
effects upon the demography and evolution
of Indian populations in the state. As the
work of Arends et al. (1967), Harvey
(1967), Neel and Salzano (1967), and
Roberts (1967, 1971) has shown, historical

events may profoundly alter the demographic structure of a population, and
sixteenth-century Tlaxcala may be seen
as a particularly instructive example. The
microevolution of the Tlaxcalan gene pool
was apparently influenced by substantial
demographic changes, the introduction of
new selective forces, directed migrations,
and the widespread admixture of “Spanish”
genes. This study offers the possibility of
assessing the historical effects of fertility,
mortality, and gene flow upon the microevolution of a mixed population.
