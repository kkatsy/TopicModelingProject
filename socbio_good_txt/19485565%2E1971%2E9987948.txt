Corporal Development and Other
Characteristics of School Children
and University Students in Greece

Vasilios G. Valaoras

Center for Biometric and Demographic Research
University of Athens
Athens, Greece

During the period 1961-68, which
roughly coincides with the active life of
the Center of Biometric and Demographic
Research of the University of Athens, two
large-scale surveys, one on the school
population and the other on the medical
students of the University were carried
out (Valaoras and Laros, 1969; Valaoras,
19700), the principal findings of which are
summarized below.

SAMPLE SURVEY ON ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL CHILDREN, 1963-66

Out of about one million young children
who attend the nearly 10,000 public
schools in Greece,! a sample of 6,254 pupils
was examined in 110 localities from all
major geographic regions of the country
(Table 1). A team of investigators, comprised of at least one medical doctor, university assistant, and one nurse, visited
each school during its regular day program
and with the consent and cooperation of
the school master examined all children

1A small proportion (about 7%) of children
in the age of compulsory schooling were attending
private schools, functioning under the supervision
of the Ministry of Education.

 

 

present in the class on that day. The information collected includes data on the
age and sex of the child, size and composition of the family, stature and body weight,
skinfold and eye color, the findings from
a cursory medical examination, an account
of previous diseases, vaccinations, and
inoculations and a statement about the
breakfast the child took at home the day
of examination. Following are some of
the most relevant results of this countrywide survey.

Corporal development of the children
in the sample (Table 2) appears at a muchimproved level with respect to that during
the war or the pre-war periods (Valaoras,
1946, p. 226-227). Compared with corresponding data of 1927-28, the average boy
or girl of this series was taller by 6.1 cm.
but the average body weight was somewhat lighter. Compared with another
sample taken during the war years 1942—
43, gains are consistent in both stature
(~+-3.5 cm.) and weight (+1.6 kg.).
Although the series are not entirely comparable (earlier data derived from only
one region, that of the capital area), the
general trend is indicative of the ensuing

* Dividing line between urban-rural localities was a population of over or under 1,000 in the 1961 census. For urban-rural analysis the marginal ages (5th and 13th year) were omitted, because the numbers were small. The _remainder (3,074 boys and 2,736 girls) were about equally divided between urban and rural localities. The standard
deviation was around 6.5 cm for stature, 4.0 kg for the weight and 1.8 mm for the skinfold. Significance of the
differences were checked by the criterion x/o. It was low (no significant difference) for height and weight between
boys and girls of the same age, but for the skinfold it was highly significant (103). In the comparison between
cree rial. al pe variables differed significantly, with an x/o = 42 for stature, x/o=26 for weight, and x/c
= 60 for the skinfold.

comparison, but our finding corroborates
the known fact that female bodies accumulate more fat under the skin than males
of the same age. In this study measurements were made by means of a standard anthropometer (Gneupel-Suisse) and
a skinfold caliper (Johnbull-England).
Height and body weight of children was
taken without shoes and with the minimum
underwear clothing; skinfold, at the (dorsal) interscapular region.

Geographic variations do occur, the
tallest and heaviest children being those
living in Attica and other cities of Central
Greece, while Thessaly and Epirus yielded
the smallest specimens. That this is due to
socioeconomic differentials and particularly
to the status of the child’s nutrition becomes evident from the urban-rural analysis shown in Table 2. Data from villages
with a population (in 1961) of up to
1,000 persons (rural) were matched at
about equal numbers with those residing
in larger localities (urban = 1,000 +),
and the aggregate finding puts a clear
disadvantage to the former. Village school
children were on the average 5.5 cm.
shorter, their body weight was less by
2.85 kg., and their skinfold was only about
half as thick as in those living in the apparently more prosperous towns and
cities. Since the annual increment for children in this age group amounts to about
4 cm. in height and to about 2.2 kg. in
body weight, it follows that rural pupils
of the sample were lagging behind their
urban colleagues by more than one age
year in terms of their corporal development.

In an attempt to measure the approximate health standard, each child of the
sample was first given a cursory ten-minute
medical examination and then a short
account of the past medical history was
taken. Only the most obvious departures
from the normal were recorded during

the medical examination, and a summary
of frequencies observed (expressed as a
per cent of the total examined for each
symptom) is given in Table 3. There was

little and rather random age and sex variability in the frequencies observed. Though
most of these abnormalities were classified
as “minor” and all diagnoses were to be
verified later by the family physician, the
rather heavy prevalence (amounting to a
little over two defects per child) casts
some doubts about the efficiency of the
public health services and medical care
practices, especially in the rural areas,
where the frequencies of defects were about
twice as high as those in the urban centers.

Village children were also shorter and
lighter in weight, a clear sign of an unbalanced diet and/or chronic malnutrition.
As to the breakfast they had before coming
to school that day, the majority of responses in the rural areas varied between
“nothing” or “bread alone” or “bread and
tea or coffee,” in contrast to the town or
city children who reported “milk” or

“cheese” or “eggs” and “fruits” together
with their breakfast bread.

There is no general shortage of physicians in the country (1.4 doctors per
1,000 persons in 1965), but most of them
are serving the urban population which
amounts to about 45% of the total. Public
health services are also scanty in rural
areas and a School Health Officer seldom,
if ever, visits the remote village schools. A
gradual build-up of an efficient School
Health Service, covering the entire body of
the school population of the country, with
periodic medical examination would render
quick and sizable returns in terms of
wholesome health and sound corporal development of the new generation.

STUDENT’S SURVEY, 1961-1968

In conformity with the university study
program, undergraduate students in the
fourth year of the six-year medical school
and those in the third year (out of five
years) of its dentistry branch are required
to work in the Department of Hygiene and
Epidemiology for about 80 hours during
the academic year. All the students who
took this course during the seven academic
years (1961-62 to 1967-68) were examined by the professor and his staff, and the
following information has been entered into

group (ABO and Rhesus), age, education
and occupation of parents, size and composition of the family he or she belongs
to, as well as that of both parents, high
school grades, and knowledge of foreign
languages. The analysis yielded several
interesting findings, the most relevant
being as follows:

SIZE AND ATTRIBUTES OF THE SAMPLE

Table 4 gives the numbers examined in
each academic year by sex and school.”
With an annual average of 553 students
in medicine and 134 in dentistry the numbers seem rather high in relation to both
the total body of students in this university
(21% of those in corresponding year of
study) and the respective needs of the
country (680 persons per physician in
1965). They also exceed the teaching
capacity of the medical school (26 professors with an average of 4 assistants each)?
and are on the increase, in spite of the
growing evidences of an overcrowded
medical profession and the loss of about
two hundred holders of the medical degree
per year to foreign emigration.

The sex and age distribution is given in
Table 5. The variables in Tables 5-8 are
given for all students by sex because there
was so little difference between medical and
dental students. Female participation in
the sample amounts to 23.0% for the
medical students and to 53.5% for those
in dentistry. The skewness of the distribution in the age scale calls for some
explanation. Under the existing system of
public education, entrance to the six year

2 Of this sample, 371 students (9.6%) were not
nationals, coming mostly from Cyprus and other
countries in the Near East, Africa, and Asia.

3 Numbers and conditions are almost exactly
duplicated in the second medical school of the
country, that of the University of Salonica.

elementary school program is required at
the age between five and six years. High
school takes another six-year period. Consequently, those seeking admission in a
university school are in about their eighteenth year, and the present sample should
have been piled up at the ages between
the twenty-second and twenty-third year.
The fact that 36% of the students were
older than that limit (the oldest student
in the sample was 47 years old) indicates
that several years were lost during the
preceding period of formal education.

Due to the leniency of the system, those
who fail in the annual examinations are
allowed to try again and again in subsequent years until they finally manage to
pass, even if it has to be at a very low
level. In this way the proportion of dropouts is minimized, but time and money
are profusely wasted and the principle of
the selection of an intellectual elite for
which higher education should be reserved
is seriously breached. However, this seems
to apply mostly to male students, since
the great majority of girls (94% versus
78% for males) were in the age bracket
below twenty-five.

Younger as they are on the average,
female students seem to fare better, if
judgment is to be passed on the final high
school grade, just before they were ad

from 11 to 20 are represented in this sample; but those at the top with “excellent”
or “good” performance (Grade 17 and

27% among boys (Table 6). With an ayerage grade of 15.9 for males and of 17.1

but only one fifth of the latter, would have
been denied admission if recruitment to
the medical school were to be restricted

above average).

In another criterion, that of the study
of foreign languages, female students score
again better with a proportion of 78%
(against 70% for males) knowing one or
more foreign languages (Table 7). English
is the most preferred additional language

Only national students (V = 3,493) were
included in this and the following analyses.

ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS

Table 8 gives the average height and
body weight of the students by sex, in two
age groups, namely those below and those
above age 25. Younger students are somewhat taller, but older students are definitely heavier, an indication of the peculiar
time trend followed by these two variables.
Putting on excess weight as one gets older
is a common phenomenon in the Western
world, but the shorter stature of older
students can be accounted for only by retracing events which occurred during their
childhood. Born during the war or postwar period and exposed to many deprivations, the older students of the sample
seem to have lost some of their “normal”
stature, which otherwise would have been
attained in adulthood. A curtailment of at
least 1.5 cm. was observed in the average
stature of army conscripts (Valaoras,
1970a) as a result of such adverse living
conditions, but the fact that male students
are by about 5 cm. taller than the soldiers
of the same age indicates that this sample
must have been of a highly selective origin.
It appears that university students in
Greece are mostly recruited from the mid

dle and upper social strata, among which
environmental factors (such as better than
average living and nutritional standards)
result in a better corporal development in
comparison with that of the general population.

The size and the shape of the head
(cephalometry) was established by taking
the two main axes of the head of the students, the average size of which, by sex,
was as follows (in cm.).

 

 

Cephalometry: Length Breadth
Males ...... 18.5 15.1
Females 17.6 14.3

The female head is a little smaller than
male, but the resulting distribution of the
sample in the scale of the cephalic index
is almost identical for the two sexes, In its
combined form the distribution (given in
Table 9) shows the majority with a broadroundish head, and only a few (10%)
belonging to the group of dolichocephalics.
This seems to be in agreement with observations made in many European populations, in which an evolutionary trend towards brachycephalism was depicted.*

4 The evolutionary trend from a narrow to a
round head is suggested from the following quotation, among others: “A tendency toward progressive brachycephalization has often been
observed, both in geologic and in historic time,
but is unexplained .... Thus, the percentage of
the population that is brachycranial . . . is:
Sweden: modern 13%, Iron and Middle Ages, 3%
to 7%; Denmark: modern, 33%, Iron Age, 2%;
Slavs: modern, 85%, 6th to 12th century, 9%;
Greeks: modern, 54%, Classic, 10%; Crete:
we 38%, Minoan, 9%” (Kroeber, 1948, p.
128).

The pigmentation of the eye was found
to run through the entire scale, from light
blue to completely dark irises, as shown in
Table 10. It is signficant that both surveys
under review yielded almost identical results in this respect, with a sizable proportion (22%) in the light shades of blue and
green colors and very few with extremely
dark eyes. The distribution of the sample
in accordance with ABO blood groups
(Table 11) is similar to that obtained
from a large sample of soldiers born in
south-central Greece, i.e., the area from
which the students of the University of
Athens are mostly drawn. The rather high
proportion (95.5%) of Rhesus positive
individuals corroborates previous findings
on the same population.

BIOSOCIAL BACKGROUND

of 22.9 years, is usually (48.5%) the first

57 years and that of his mother, 50 years.
Orphanhood among students was quite
prevalent (15%), most of which is attributed to the loss of the father (11%),
but in a few cases (about 1%) to the loss
of both parents. No case of divorced parents was reported in this sample. The average size of the parent’s families was
significantly larger (father’s family with
4.85 children, mother’s family with 4.60),
a telling evidence of the secular decline of
fertility in this country.

Seen from the socioeconomic point of
view, the families who choose to send at
least one of their children to study medicine
or dentistry are certainly not typical of the
general population. It seems that the lower
socioeconomic strata, as may be defined by
the profession or the educational level of
parents, are grossly underrepresented in
the sample, which is mostly made up of
families with medium to high income and
with more than average educational status.
Though comparisons with the 1961 population census returns tend to exaggerate
somewhat the differences (the census
counts “persons” while the family is the
unit in this sample), the mere fact that
the population engaged in agriculture
amounted to over 50% of the male labor
force in 1961, but provided only 14% of
the students in the sample, is quite indicative of the prevailing patterns. Most of
the students are the sons of fathers in the
high professional ranks (33%) or of public
functionaries (21%) or of merchants
(20%), and only few of them manage to
emerge from the more populous classes of
farmers or laborers.

A similar trend is depicted in Table 12,
where the fathers of the sample and the
male population (10 years and over) of
the 1961 census are distributed in accordance with their level of education. Those
with a university degree contribute almost
13 times more students than their share

population, appear in the sample with only
28% of all students.

It is not known whether a similar pattern
applies or not in the recruitment of students for the other university schools. It
would be highly detrimental if it were so.
Notwithstanding the antiquated custom
of keeping the medical profession within
certain family lines, the nonequitable recruitment of university students from all
population strata would violate the principle of equal opportunity for every child
in the country and would result in an inexcusable wastage of intellectual talents
which are apt to emerge in every social
group irrespective of the professional status,
income, or educational level of the head of
the family.
