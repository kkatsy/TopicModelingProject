Stress, Health, and Political Participation

ABSTRACT: A sample of urban Canadian adults who were interviewed and medically examined
provided the basis for an exploration of the relation between political behavior and physical
stature, general health, and stress. People active in communal and protest political activities
showed more stress than, but were otherwise similar to, people who did not participate in such
activities. In particular, political actives who were not confident about their effectiveness showed
signs of even more stress. People who participated in campaign activities were similar to inactives
with respect to signs of stress and general health, but were of smaller stature.

Social scientists have given considerable
attention to the social and psychological
roots and consequences of political behavior. However, until recently, little attention has been paid to its biological links.
Several writers have called for more systematic investigations of the relation between biology and political behavior
(Wiegele, 1973; Masters, 1972; Corning,
1971; Somit, 1968, 1972; Schubert, 1973).
Thus far, only a few studies have been
done that relate biological states and processes to political behavior (e.g., Wahlke
and Lodge, 1972; Jaros, 1972; Welch and
Booth, 1975; Welch, 1976; Stauffer, 1969).
We attempt to bridge this gap with a study
focusing on the question: Are politically
active individuals physiologically different
from people who are not active?

Two research orientations guided us: (1)
studies linking human political behavior
to stress and its attendant physiological
manifestations; and (2) investigations of
animal behavior linking dominance to
physical prowess and good health. An example of the first orientation is the work
reported by Harold Lasswell in Power and
Personality (1928). Since then, these ideas
have been further developed by Lane
(1959) and others. Lane argued that politi
cal participation may offer assistance in
handling of intrapsychic conflicts by (a)
providing a means of repressing the forbidden impulse or quieting the insistent
conscience, (b) offering “legitimate” channels for expressing the forbidden impulse,
or (c) facilitating a life style embodying a
particular compromise solution to the
psychic conflict (Lane, 1959, p. 123).
Thus, politics can serve as a way of expressing one’s emotions in a way perceived
as legitimate by society, rather than bottling them up inside.

On the other hand, Lasswell has also
described the political personality as one
that is characterized by an “intense and
ungratified craving for deference” (1948,
p. 20), which suggests that political actives
may be under stress as well. Thus, some of
Lane’s predictions would lead us to expect
nonactivists to show more signs of stress
than those who are politically active.
Other hypotheses, however, suggest the
reverse, that it is the actives who are
stress-ridden. Regardless of which theory,
if either, is correct, it is of interest to examine the relation between political activity
and stress.

The second research orientation linking
biological processes with political behav
102

ior is found in studies of animal behavior.
Pecking orders and dominance hierarchies
are characteristic of all nonhuman vertebrates and many lower animals (Lorenz,
1963; Tinbergen, 1953; Ardrey, 1970).
Each animal’s position in the hierarchy is
determined by ritualized fighting (EiblEibesfeldt, 1961). The dominance hierarchy serves to organize community activities such as protecting females and the
young from predators. Also, when the
needs of the population exceed the support
capability of the environment, the subordinate animals are forced out, leaving
enough resources for the dominant members to reproduce (Wynne-Edwards,
1964). Because the basis for establishing
the social order is aggression, the dominant animals are usually older, larger,
stronger, faster and more often born without physical defects than are subordinate
animals.

On the other hand, subordinate animals, particularly if they have been harassed by the dominant members, may
show more signs of stress. For example,
rats and mice of subordinate status (as
measured by the number of fights they
have lost) manifest greatest adrenal activity (Barnett, 1955). Indeed, in the mere
presence of successful fighters, consistent
losers exhibit heightened adrenocortical
activity (Bronson and Eleftherion, 1964).
Monkeys who are frequently harassed by a
dominant partner show high needs for calcium and serum protein (Angermeier et
al., 1968). The veracity of the relation between adrenocortical activity and dominance has been demonstrated by experiments where it has been shown that mice
receiving noradrenaline injections have
increased dominance as compared to those
animals receiving no cathecholamines
(Bronson and Eleftherian, 1964).

If we can make inferences about humans from these animal studies, we would
expect to find leaders or actives to be

103

larger, stronger, healthier, and to show
fewer signs of stress than nonleaders or
nonactives. However, the research linking
political behavior to size, health, and
stress among humans is not altogether
consistent with animal behavior studies.
Feldman (1975) argues that short people
are discriminated against and thereby excluded from positions of power, and Stogdill (1949), in a review of eleven studies,
concludes that leaders tend to be taller
than nonleaders. However, after reviewing pertinent research, Gibb (1969) concludes that “when height is a significant
factor in the achievement of leadership
status ... it is so as a result of its correlations with other factors which . . . are
significant for the assumption of the leadership role.” Gibb (1969) reaches a similar
conclusion about weight after a review of
human and animal studies. While the
studies are few and inconclusive, many
writers believe that leaders have greater
energy and enjoy better health than nonleaders (Gibb, 1969). Wiegele et al. (1975)
find little relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and political orientations, but they do show that the more fit
subjects are less likely to feel high levels of
anomia. Funkelstein et al. (1957) suggest
that people who respond aggressively have
higher levels of noradrenaline while those
for whom anxiety is a typical response
show elevated adrenaline levels. However, attempts to replicate his findings
have not been © successful (Frankenhaeuser, 1971).

Clearly, no firm conclusions may be
drawn about the relation between physiological qualities and political power from
the research done thus far. The purpose of
the study reported here is to advance our
knowledge about the correlation between
political activity and physiological features and processes. Political activity is
examined as one dimension of leadership
(dominance). People may be dominant or

104

subordinate in several aspects of their life,
but politics is one areain which people are
trying to convince others of their point of
view, i.e., exercise dominance. While not
all individuals who are politically active
will have a great deal of impact on other
people, we believe that most politically
active people are exhibiting behavior that
is an expression of attempts to actively
implement their policy preferences. Thus,
political activity is an appropriate area in
which to examine the relationship between
dominance and physiological factors.

We analyze interview and physical examination data from a sample of urban
Canadian adults for whom we have detailed information on political activity as
well as on physical stature, general health,
and stress. Prior investigations treat political behavior both as an independent and
as a dependent variable. Because no clear
causal flow is evident, we somewhat arbitrarily use political behavior as an independent variable, with stress, stature, and
health indices as the dependent variables.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SAMPLE

The data for this study came from a
stratified probability sample of Toronto
families studied in 1973. A comparison of
our sample with 1971 census data shows
our sample to be quite representative of
Toronto households. For example, according to the 1971 census, 39 per cent of the
city’s population had a mother tongue
other than English; the proportion in the
present sample was 41 per cent. The average number of rooms per dwelling according to the census was 5.2; in our sample it
was 4.9. The proportion of households
having intact families was 71 per cent in
the census and 69 per cent in the present
sample. We believe that these minor discrepancies do not preclude our generalizing our findings to urban adult family
members.

Booth and Welch

 

Social Biology

The population sampled was comprised
of intact white families of European or
North American descent with one or more
children in which the wife was under age
45 and who had resided in their present
dwelling unit for at least three months.
Screening interviews yielded 862 eligible
households. In 560 households we were
able to interview one or both parents for a
65 per cent completion rate. In all, 856
persons were interviewed. Of the 856, 507
were given physical examinations at a
nearby health center.

To determine whether or not those who
consented to be examined differed from
those who did not in some way that would
bias our results, we systematically compared the two groups with respect to
health information obtained during the
interview and demographic characteristics. Those who received physical exams
had a slightly higher socioeconomic status,
but in all other respects were the same as
those who did not.

POLITICAL VARIABLES

Three types of participation variables
were analyzed. Exact wording of the items
is as follows.

There are a lot of ways for people to take
part in political activities. Some people don’t
take part at all. Here are a number of things
that some people might do. We would like to
know if you have done any of these things in
the last two years and if you have, how many
times. Vote for a political candidate whose
ideas you think are good ones? Talk to
friends, family, or other people you know to
try to get them to vote for or against a candidate or issue? Give money to help someone
win an election? Attend rallies, barbeques,
meetings, or things like that in connection
with an election? Work in a political campaign for a candidate whose ideas you think
are good ones?

During the past two years, have you attended any meetings in which tenants rights,
problems with landlords, housing code enforcement, public housing or neighborhood
renewal were discussed? Are there conditions in your home that you believe make it
an unsafe or hazardous place in which to
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 25, No. 2

live? If yes, have you ever talked about these
or any kinds of housing problems to a government official or political leader—such as
an alderman, housing officer, someone in
city hall, or a local party or community
leader?

There are many ways for people to show
agreement or disagreement with what the
government is doing. I would like to know
which of these means you approve of. I
would also like to know if you have ever
used any of these methods. Writing letters to
elected officialk—members of Parliament,
mayors, etc.—or signing a petition; taking a
petition around to try to get neighbors and
people you know to sign it; going to a meeting at a government office to tell them what
you think about something the government
is doing; taking part in protest meetings, rallies, or marches which are permitted by local
authorities; refusing to obey a law that one
thinks is unfair; trying to show the government what you think by taking part in nonviolent sit-ins, mass demonstrations, and
things like that which are not permitted by
local authorities.

The final three items in the last section
were classified as “protest” acts and the
remainder as “traditional” acts. A principal axis factor analysis of the fifteen kinds
of traditional and protest activities given
in the items above revealed four predominant factors. The first factor was comprised of the voting items. We excluded
this dimension from our analysis because
voting requires a very limited commitment
of time and resources. The second factor
was a campaign activism dimension. The
third was a dimension including such
items as taking a petition around, going to
neighborhood meetings, and talking to
political officials about local problems.
This combination of contacting and
cooperative activity is comparable to the
communal dimension found by Verba and
Nie (1972). The protest activities form a
distinct fourth dimension.

A list of the items with the per cent
participation in each is found in Table 1.
The factor analysis is displayed in Table

scales were constructed by adding together
the number of times the individual took
part in each activity. The communal and
campaign scales were recoded into three
categories: no activity, some activity, and
considerable activity. The last category
was created by recoding the data so that
the category included at least 15 per cent
of the population, which insured enough
people in the active category to carry out
the analysis. The correlations between the
three variables are modest (ranging from
0.17 to 0.28), indicating that the variables
measure different aspects of political participation.

PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES

Presence of communicable, infectious,
and stress diseases, or other diseases, was
based on responses to a set of 42 symptomatic questions, information obtained
by interview and examination by a nurse
and a physician, and data based on tests of
urine and blood samples obtained at the
time of the exam. The height, weight, and
girth of the respondent was obtained along
with other pertinent pre-exam data. The
physicians gave a thorough physical examination which included repeating the pulse

and blood pressure measures until they
had obtained a stable reading. The medical center staff had no information about
the political activities of the respondents
which might bias their examination. Urine
and blood specimens were analyzed by an
independent laboratory and integrated
with data collected earlier by one of the
examining physicians.

Five measures of general health are
used in the analysis, three from the physical exam and two from the interview.
Chest expansion (the difference between
deep inhalation and exhalation) is used as
a general measure of physical condition. A
second measure from the physical exam is
the total number of diseases the respondent had, excluding psychiatric impairment, congenital deformities, and trauma.
While the conditions necessary for communicable diseases to be transmitted vary

considerably between pathologies, if political activity entails extensive human contacts, we would expect politically active
people to contract communicable diseases
more often than do uninvolved individuals. Whether or not the individual was
diagnosed as having a communicable disease was included as a third measure of
health. In the interview the self-report illness history of the respondent was assessed by the queries: “Within the last two
weeks, did you stay in bed all or part of
any day because you were not feeling
well?” and “Do you have any health problem or illness that you have had for more
than three months?” The responses to
these queries constitute the remaining two
health measures.

For our assessment of stress we again
relied on indicators from both the physical
exam and the interview. Because numer
 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

Vol. 25, No. 2

ous studies have linked intense or protracted stress to disease (Selye, 1956; Cassell, 1970; Levi, 1971), the presence of a
stress disease was selected as one indicator
of stress. People were coded as having a
stress disease if the physician diagnosed
essential hypertension (Brod, 1971), angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction (Raab, 1971), peptic ulcers (Pfeiffer,
1971), or irritable colon (Davenport, 1966,
p. 158). A second category, infectious diseases, has also been linked to stress. Under
stress, anti-inflammatory adrenal steroids
are secreted. While they are useful in
enabling the organism to survive during
an emergency by suppressing excessive
inflammatory reaction, they also permit
the spread of infections (Turner, 1966).
The presence of an infectious disease was
a second measure of stress.

Since stress diseases represent the end of
a long chain of physiological events, we
also chose to examine six physiological
indicators of stress which are precursors
to disease: diastolic blood pressure,
catecholamine levels, eosinopenia,  serum-free thyroxine levels, uric acid, and
cholesterol. Mason (1968), in a thorough
analysis of psychoendocrine research, indicates that our knowledge about the sensitivity to stress of the various endocrine
systems is most extensive with respect
to the sympathetic-adrenal medullary,
the pituitary-adrenal cortical, and the
pituitary-thyroid systems. Accordingly,
we examined the activity of these three
systems, although many of our measures
were indirect. Blood pressure, especially
diastolic (Hamburg et al., 1973), and
catecholamine (adrenaline and _ noradrenaline) levels (Froberg et al., 1971) have
been linked to stress and constitute our
indicators of sympathetic-adrenal medullary activity. Eosinopenia, our indicator of
plasma corticoids, has been shown to be
one of the pituitary-adrenal cortical system’s response to stress (Mason, 1968). We

107

have selected the serum-free thyroxine as
our indicator of a stress response on the
part of the pituitary-thyroid system (Dillon, 1973). While the link between serum
cholesterol and endocrine function is unclear, considerable research has shown
cholesterol to be responsive to stress (Rahe
et al., 1971). Serum uric acid has also been
linked to stress (Kutz and Weiner, 1972).

From the interview we devised four
other measures of stress. A uterine disorder index was created from a series of five
items. While evidence is far from complete, a comprehensive review of research
relating stress and uterine dysfunction
suggests that stress may cause suppressed
menstruation cycles, bleeding between periods, excessive uterine bleeding, unusually painful periods, excessive vaginal discharges, and spontaneous abortions (Gibbons, 1961).

Whether or not the individual! regularly
took a sedative-hypnotic drug during the
twelve months preceding the interview
constituted our second interview-based
stress variable. These drugs include tranquilizers, nerve medicines, and sleeping
pills. Another indicator of stress was alcohol consumption. Here a dummy variable
was created to indicate whether or not the
individual consumed an average of more
than one drink per day. Our final index of
stress was the individual’s score on a general psychiatric impairment index created
by Langner (1962).

Finally, we also examined the extent to
which political actives are taller and weigh
more. Overweight people are separated
from those with the larger stature to examine the role of obesity in encouraging or
depressing political activity. The girth of
the individual will constitute our measure
of obesity.

RESULTS

The results suggest that there are few
differences between politically active and
inactive people either with respect to
health, signs of stress, or stature. In all, 22
variables were examined. There were
statistically significant (0.05 level) differences between actives and inactives for 10
of the 22 variables in the case of communal activity, and 5 each in the case of
campaign and protest activity. While the
number of statistically significant differences are more than the three that we
would expect to find by chance, the differences are small in magnitude and somewhat inconsistent in direction.

COMMUNAL ACTIVITY

There are virtually no differences in the
height, weight, or extent of obesity between actives and inactives. For the five
health measures we find somewhat inconsistent results. On one hand, the physical
examination data showed no differences
between actives and inactives. Their chest
expansion is identical. The number of diseases found by the physicians are fewer
among actives than inactives. Yet, on the
other hand, the self-report items suggest
contrary trends. People who actively engage in communal political activities report being sick in bed recently more often
than those less involved in such activities.
Moreover, the actives report having a
health problem that has lasted three
months or longer more often than do individuals less active in communal activities.
Why the physician data should differ from
the self-report data is not clear. Perhaps
people who are active communally are
conscious of and discuss their ailments
more often than others. Communal activity entails taking some initiative in discussions; discussing health problems with an
interviewer may be a similar activity.

The stress variables present an equally

Health and Political Participation

 

109

mixed set of findings. On the one hand,
communal actives have lower blood
pressure and fewer stress diseases than do
people less involved in communal political
activities. On the other hand, the actives
have higher levels of serum uric acid, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, consume
sedative-hypnotic drugs more often, score
higher on the psychiatric impairment index, and females score higher on the
uterine disorder index. There are no appreciable differences on the other stress
indicators. Clearly, those heavily involved
in communal activities are under some
stress. However, the stress is such that it
has not manifested itself in the long-term
indicators such as high blood pressure and
the presence of stress diseases, which is to
be expected in this relatively young sample
(average age 37). In sum, communally active individuals have the same stature and
general health as less active people, but
they exhibit more short-term signs of
stress.

PROTEST ACTIVITY

Those active in protest activities have a
pattern similar to that of communal actives. However, there are fewer differences between actives and inactives that
are Statistically significant. The data from
the physical exam show that actives are as
healthy as inactives. Like communal actives, people heavily involved in protest
activities report being sick in bed recently
more often than inactives. Unlike the
communal actives, those heavily engaged
in protest activities do not report longterm health problems more often than the
uninvolved.

While only 3 of the 14 stress indicators
analyzed showed actives to be significantly
different from inactive people, the basic
pattern is the same as that for communal
actives. The long-term stress indicators
(such as blood pressure or disease) show
that actives manifest the same amount of

stress as people uninvolved in protest activities. However, many of the short-term
indicators (uterine disorders, alcohol consumption, psychiatric impairment index)
indicate that actives experience more
stress than inactives. In short, people active in protest activities have the same
stature and general health as less active
people, but they show more short-term
signs of stress.

CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY

While people active in campaign work
tend to be shorter and lighter than less
involved individuals,? both the physical
exam data and the self-report health information suggest that actives are no more
or less healthy than other people. The
stress indicators show a similar trend.
Only 3 of the 14 indicators suggest any
difference between actives and inactives.
Systolic blood pressure and eosinophil
count suggest actives are under less stress
than inactive people, while the serum adrenaline indicator shows the reverse trend.
We may conclude that people active in
political campaigns enjoy the same health
and experience the same amount of stress
as those who are inactive.

In sum, we find people who are active in
communal and protest activities show
more signs of short-term stress than do
their inactive counterparts, but are similar
to nonparticipants when it comes to physical stature and health. On the other hand,
people who participated in campaign activities display no more stress symptoms
than people inactive in this realm, but
they are of smaller stature. The reason for
the difference in stature is not readily apparent.

2 Dividing the sample by sex, we still find that
actives weigh less (significantly less among the
women, but only slightly less among the men) and
are shorter. This latter difference is significant
among the men and very small in the sample of
women.

SOURCES OF STRESS

To examine further the origin of stress
among political actives, we recomputed
the equations for people scoring high on a
scale of political efficacy and for those
scoring low. People were asked whether
they agree or disagree with the following
items: “It seems to me that whoever you
vote for, things go on pretty much the
same”; “Nothing I ever do seems to have
any effect upon what happens in politics”;
“No matter what people think, a few
people will always run things anyway.”
Individuals who disagreed with one or
more items were categorized as scoring
high on political efficacy. While a person
disagreeing with only one item may not
feel especially efficacious, we chose this
cutoff point to insure that we had enough
cases in each analysis.

Inspection of the data in Table 4 suggests that stress observed among the political actives is found more among the inefficacious than the efficacious. For example, in the analysis of communal political
participation, actives with feelings of limited efficacy show more indications of
stress than actives who feel efficacious.
The nine stress indicators in which this
difference is particularly apparent are: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, infectious diseases, alcohol and drug use,
and psychiatric impairment. Three indicators have similar values for efficacious
and nonefficacious actives, and two stress
indicators (uterine disorders and _ stress
diseases) have a pattern which is not consistent with this interpretation.

An examination of participation in protest activities reveals a similar pattern for
11 out of the 14 stress indicators. Systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, thyroxine,
eosinophil count, cholesterol, adrenaline,
stress and infectious diseases, alcohol and
drug consumption, and psychiatric impairment are consistent with our interpre

tation. Only the uric acid measure is an
exception to this pattern, while two other
measures show little difference. In other
words, politically active people (except
those doing campaign work) who feel that
their efforts are generally effective are less
prone to show signs of stress. In some
cases there may be a conspicuous absence
of stress. On the other hand, political actives who are not confident about their
effectiveness show more signs of stress.
Why people who are not confident about
the effect of their work continue a high
level of political participation is an intriguing question, but one we cannot answer
with the data at hand.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We find that people who are politically
involved in communal and protest activities show more signs of short-term
stress than do individuals not so involved.
The signs of stress are most pronounced
among actives with a low sense of political
efficacy. No other differences in health or
stature are apparent. Campaign actives
are no different than inactives with respect
to health and stress, but the former are
found to be of shorter stature than the
latter.

Why those involved in campaign activities do not show the same signs of
stress as do people active in communal
and protest activities is not clear. We may
speculate that the initiative required by
campaign activities (talking to friends,
giving money) is less than that required by
protest or communal activities. Campaign
activities are fairly routine and structured.
Why campaign actives should be of
smaller stature than nonactives is equally
puzzling. While discrimination against
short people has been documented
(Feldman 1975), it is difficult to see how
discrimination is operating in this particular arena.

Booth and Welch

Social Biology

Clearly, we cannot generalize our
findings to political elites. Few of the
people in our sample are politicians on a
full-time basis. Were we to have a subsample of full-time politicians to compare
with our sample, it is possible that we
might find patterns that more closely
parallel the findings of ethological studies
of nonhuman species where the leaders
tend to be larger, stronger, and in better
health than nonleaders.

However, even were we able to isolate
such differences, it would be difficult to
attribute them to interspecies similarities.
In a comparison of pecking orders in chickens and human status relations, Masur
(1973, p. 515) observes:

It is difficult to interpret the chicken-human
comparisons. Similarities are interesting, but
the differences are striking. One can always
make analogies between any two species; but
one cannot always tell if the analogies are
meaningful, particularly when the two
species are widely separated on_ the
phylogenetic tree.

He goes on to note that:

Behaviors that are on the surface similar
may be based on dissimilar mechanisms, so
the analogy has little substance.

In comparing human political behavior
to status behavior among animals, there
are certainly important differences that
stand out. Dominance among humans
may rely upon intelligence and organizational skill and is unlikely to be a function
of simple physical prowess. Furthermore,
among humans the notion of dominance is
less clear-cut than in animal societies.
Most people are dominant in some aspects
of their social relationships and subordinate in others; few are either subordinate
in all or dominant in all. Dominance or
subordination in political life probably
plays a relatively minor role in the lives of
most individuals. Thus, the effect of the
presence or absence of political activity on

health and stress might be expected to be
less than clear-cut. And, in fact, political
actives did not differ significantly and consistently from inactives. Where they did
differ, the actives were under more stress
than the inactives, not what one would
expect from a simple extrapolation from
the animal findings.

The findings that the inefficacious actives show more short-term signs of stress
than the efficacious is another interesting
finding. It will be recalled that in nonhuman species it has been found that consistent losers show more signs of stress. If the
actives in our sample who have a low
sense of political efficacy derive their feelings from a lack of political success, the
signs of stress observed in our study may
have their roots in the same mechanism
that induces the loser in nonhuman species
to exhibit evidence of stress. On the other
hand, perhaps we are seeing the physiological manifestations of psychological dissonance: spending one’s time working in
politics while believing it has no impact.
Why people choose to be involved in poli
Health and Political Participation

tics while feeling their involvement has no
impact is an interesting question. If their
belief comes out of past attempts to
influence government, why do they continue?

The fact that actives showed more signs
of stress than inactives is consistent with
Laswell’s (1948) hypotheses that political
actives are under stress. However, the argument that political activity offers an outlet for intrapsychic stress requires longterm data that we did not have. Perhaps
the actives started out with higher levels of
stress prior to political involvement which
then diminished to the levels we found.
On the other hand, the political activity
may have given rise to the stress we discovered. Studies relying on longitudinal
data will be needed to resolve this issue.
