ABSTRACT: This paper examines the degree of preoperative ambivalence expressed by 255
currently married tubal ligation patients compared to 167 wives of vasectomy patients
regarding the decision to terminate childbearing and aspects of the decision-making process
which account for differences between groups. Data indicate that tubal ligation women are
significantly more certain and comfortable with their decision than are vasectomy wives. In
order to explain this finding, analysis focused on sociodemographic factors; time factors related
to the decision; variables related to communication with spouse and others; factors internal to
the individual, including interest in another child and motivation for the decision; external
constraints on the decision; and couple dynamics in the decision-making process. Results
indicate that group differences in ambivalence are primarily due to the effects of strong male
control over the termination decision, as perceived by the wife, and a disproportionate
prevalence of this pattern among vasectomy couples. An interaction effect between male
dominance and group membership was also found. Implications of study results for

preoperative counseling, including likely sources of future regret, are considered.

Selection of sterilization as a method
of contraception has increased dramatically within the last decade. Based on
data from the National Fertility Studies
(1965, 1970, 1975) and the National Survey of Family Growth (1973), Westoff
and Jones (1977) estimated that, for
continuously married white women,
31.3 per cent of contracepting couples
had been sterilized by 1975 (16.3 per
cent had opted for female sterilization
and 15 per cent for vasectomy), compared to 22 per cent in 1973, 14 per cent
in 1970, and 8.8 per cent in 1965. Furthermore, among contracepting couples
who desired no more children, 43.5 per
cent had been surgically sterilized by
1975, compared to 31.9 per cent in 1973,
20 per cent in 1970, and 13.7 per cent in
1965. Oral contraception, in contrast,
was adopted by only 24.1 per cent of

40

these couples in 1975. Furthermore, the
Association for Voluntary Sterilization
(AVS, 1982) estimates that between
1976 and 1981, 6,148,000 individuals (55
per cent female, 45 per cent male) were
sterilized. Acceptance of the procedure
has also been increasing in other parts of
the world. Estimates indicate that, by
1982, a total of 110 million individuals
(28 million in the developed world and
82 million in the developing world) had
undergone contraceptive sterilization.
It was the contraceptive modality chosen by 33 per cent of estimated contraceptive users compared to 16 per cent
for the oral contraceptive, 12 per cent
for the condom, and 18 per cent for the
IUD (Shelton and Speidel, 1983).
Despite the increasing demand for
tubal sterilization, there is a dearth of
well-founded data regarding the long 

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

term physical and psychosocial consequences of this surgery. Despite the volume of research in this area (e.g., see
Henry et al., 1980), few strong conclusions can be drawn about the impact of
this procedure. This is primarily due to
methodological deficiencies of previous
research, particularly failure to conduct
prospective research and the absence of
a carefully selected control group.
., _Inorder to understand the long-term
=> consequences of tubal sterilization, a
+; prospective controlled study of over 700
Z women has been undertaken. The study
3 8 group consists of 317 women scheduled
< for surgical sterilization; the two control
% groups, respectively, consist of 167
Gwomen whose husbands have been
co scheduled for vasectomy (vasectomy
Wives group) and 244 women who have
‘gs completed childbearing, but do not plan
on sterilization (non-planning group).
-2 Data from vasectomy wives are used to

g rom the non-planning group, for the

5 Caucasian women between 18 and 49
— years of age, chosen from the patient
é © populations of approximately 50 obstet2 5 tic-gynecology and urology offices and

= lower-middle- and upper-class individ4 uals. All women were intensively interviewed, either before surgery or, for
women not planning sterilization, at a
randomly assigned time. Follow-up is
occurring at annual intervals from the
first interview date.

This paper focuses on data collected
from the initial interview. Only the two
surgical subsamples, tubal ligation
women and vasectomy wives, are included. Although these groups differ in
several respects, they are much more
similar to one another than either is to

 

Preoperative Ambivalence 41

the non-planning group, which appears
to be at an earlier stage in the decisionmaking process regarding termination
of childbearing. A future publication
will address the entire sample. Eighty
per cent of the tubal group are married
(an additional 10 per cent have partners), compared to 100 per cent of the
vasectomy women. By definition, vasectomy can be relied upon by women only
when they are in a permanent relationship with a male. In order to maximize
homogeneity between these groups,
analyses presented in this paper are
based on the married subsample (255
tubal ligation women and 167 vasectomy wives) alone. Differences between
married and non-married respondents
will be addressed at a Jater time.

One objective of this study is to identify characteristics of women who subsequently regret their decision. If this subgroup can be identified preoperatively
and provided with appropriate counseling, incidence of dissatisfaction could be
reduced. Reports of regret following
surgical sterilization tend to be'relatively

‘infrequent, that is, usually less than 10

per cent and often less than 5 per cent
(Paniagua et al., 1964; Cox and Crozier,
1973; Sim et al., 1973; DiMusto et al.,
1974; Hampton and Tarnasky, 1974;
Campanella and Wolff, 1975; Neilet al.,
1975; Kopit and Barnes, 1976; Rubinstein et al., 1976; Watkins et al., 1976;
Wise et al., 1976; Cheng et al., 1977;
Stock, 1978; Henry et al., 1980). However, 5 per cent of 500,000 women annu
‘ally undergoing the procedure is 25,000

individuals. Moreover, somewhere between less than 1 per cent and 8 per cent
of sterilized women are sufficiently dissatisfied to seek reanastomosis (Henry
et al., 1980). The two major reasons for
seeking reversal in the developed and
developing world, respectively, are deDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

sire to have children with a new husband
and desire for more children, without
further explanation (Henry et al., 1980).
Because of these reasons and because
the decision to terminate childbearing is
the first step in choosing sterilization,
preoperative ambivalence regarding
childbearing termination is an important area of inquiry.

This paper examines the degree of
preoperative ambivalence expressed by
tubal ligation women, compared to vasectomy wives, regarding the termination of childbearing decision and aspects
of the decision-making process which
account for differences between groups.
If there are group differences, it is important to know if they are related to
which partner made the decision or is
undergoing the procedure or to other
factors. Moreover, analysis of these differences might provide clues as to
whether or not these groups have differential needs which should be addressed
during preoperative counseling. The
association between ambivalence regarding the decision to terminate childbearing or to undergo elective sterilization and subsequent regret has not yet
been documented in the literature; however, this relationship appears common
’ sensical and there is some evidence indi
cating a correlation between ambivalence concerning other types of reproductive decisions and subsequent regret. | | |
Sacks and La Croix (1962), using a
retrospective study design and no controls, found that 60 per cent of their sample who regretted their decision to undergo a medically indicated sterilization
expressed preoperative reluctance (either the woman, her husband, or both).
Using a prospective design, but no controls, Campanella and Wolff (1975) attributed regret and psychosomatic

Social Biology

symptoms following elective and medically indicated sterilization to poor
knowledge of the procedure, particularly its irreversibility. Some women
questioned reversibility at the follow-up
interviews, even when they were repeatedly reminded of the procedure’s permanence. The authors suggest that this
misunderstanding may show underlying
ambivalence, with subsequent somatic
displacement of feelings when permanency can no longer be denied. In a retrospective study of elective tubal sterilization and hysterectomy, Hampton and
Tarnasky (1974) suggest that preoperative ambivalence about hysterectomy is
related to subsequent adverse psychological reactions.

Lastly, a comprehensive study, combining a prospective and retrospective
format, on the psychological antecedents and consequences of induced abortion specifically considered decision ambivalence. Data collected from a
retrospective questionnaire and analyzed with multivariate techniques indicate that ambivalence about the abortion decision is a significant predictor of
future regret (Miller, 1983).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Women in the tubal ligation sample
were recruited through a letter given to
them in their physicians’ offices. Personnel in the various offices and clinics were
asked to present each Anglo Caucasian
woman scheduled for tubal sterilization
with a letter which explained the study.
Space was provided for names and telephone numbers of those patients who
agreed to be contacted. Women who did
not permit further contact were requested to provide, anonymously, basic
sociodemographic information. The
same recruitment procedure was fol

lowed in urology offices: women accompanying their husbands for vasectomy
counseling were given a recruitment letter. A separate letter was available for
men who were not accompanied by their
spouses. In these cases the men were
asked to release their wives’ names and
phone numbers. Trained interviewers
followed up by phone contact, at which
time additional information about the
study was provided and an interview
scheduled. The overall refusal rate, including initial refusal on the letter and
later refusal by phone contact, was less
than 11 per cent.

Women were interviewed in their
homes or other locations of their own
choosing. A reliability check was conducted; thirty-five women (or 5 per cent
of the sample) were randomly chosen to
be re-interviewed. Within several days
to one month from their first interview,
they were asked to re-answer questions
ranging from basic sociodemographic
queries to those concerning basic attitudes. A total of 350 repeat responses
was obtained; only 13 (or 4 per cent) differed from the original.

The data on which this paper is based
were collected during the sixteen-month
period between December 1980 and
March 1982. Analysis of variance and
the Student-Newman-Keuls test are the
primary statistical tools used. P values
are based on the F statistic for means
and the Z statistic for differences among
proportions.

RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS

Table 1 indicates several sociodemographic differences between tubal ligation and vasectomy groups. Women undergoing tubal sterilization are
approximately one year older than vas

ectomy wives (30.6 versus 29.5 years)
and a significantly greater proportion of
this group (42.3 per cent versus 6.6 per
cent) are pregnant. The former also exhibit higher parity, defined to include
current pregnancy, than do vasectomy
wives (2.41 versus 2.11 children). The
combined income of subject and spouse
is significantly higher for the tubal ligation sample.

The remaining sociodemographic

years of education, and Duncan’s SES
Scale rating—show no significant differences between groups. Subsequent
analyses have controlled for those characteristics that vary significantly between the tubal sterilization and vasec- tomy groups.

THE DECISION TO TERMINATE
CHILDBEARING

Table 2 provides data regarding ambivalence about the decision to terminate childbearing. Two measures of ambivalence are included in this study, i.e.,
degree of certainty regarding the termination decision (a continuum from completely certain through somewhat certain to not certain at all) and evidence of
mixed feelings (a continuum from experiencing no conflict through temporary
mixed feelings to continued feelings of
strong conflict). There is obviously a
great deal of overlap between these two
measures. The primary difference—
based on the actual wording of the
question—is that the first focuses on the
woman’s current (at the time of the interview) certainty that the termination
decision is a correct one, whereas the
second focuses on feelings of conflict after she first made the decision.

Responses to both questions indicate
tubal ligation women are significantly
more certain and comfortable with their
decision than are vasectomy wives. For
example, close to 96 per cent of tubal ligation subjects, compared to 87 per cent
of vasectomy wives, are either completely or almost certain that they want
no more children. Additionally, 71 per
cent of the former group, compared to
60 per cent of the latter, either experienced no conflict at all or only last minute jitters after the decision was made.
These differences remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic variability between groups.

Data presented in the remainder of
this paper will attempt to account for the
primary cause(s) of this difference. Attention is given to time factors related to
the decision; variables related to communication with spouse and others; factors internal to the individual, including
interest in another child and motivation
for the decision; external constraints on
the decision; and couple dynamics in the
decision-making process.

Table 3 presents time and discussion
variables relevant to the decisionmaking process. These data indicate

that there are no differences between
tubal ligation women and vasectomy
wives with respect to years ago first
planned on current number of children,
years ago decided to terminate childbearing, the decision interval, and number of individuals with whom the decision was discussed. Vasectomy wives,
however, discussed terminating childbearing with their husbands significantly
more often (9 times) than did tubal ligation subjects (7.6 times). However,
these differences disappear after controlling for age and current pregnancy
status. This suggests that the older pregnant woman and her spouse have discussed the issue less frequently, probably because the decision seems clearer.
Most importantly, further analysis of
variance on differences in ambivalence
(both measures) between tubal ligation
and vasectomy groups, controlling for
this variable, fails to eliminate group differences. Consequently, time and discussion variables alone cannot explain
group differences regarding ambivalence of the termination decision.

childbearing. The first variable herein

considered ts perception of social pressure. These data are considered in two
ways: (1) according to different types of
social pressure (i.e., for, against, and
both for and against) and (2) according
to whether or not any kind of social pressure was perceived. As indicated in Table 4, there are no significant differences
between groups when each type of social pressure is analyzed separately.
However, 25 per cent of the vasectomy
group compared to only 16 per cent of
the tubal ligation group have expenrenced some form of social pressure
(p < 0.03). This difference, however,
disappears after controlling for current
pregnancy status. This suggests that
pregnant women perceive less social
pressure, perhaps because external con

cerns are less salient to them. Moreover,
further analysis of variance on differences in ambivalence (both measures)
between tubal ligation and vasectomy
groups, controlling for social pressure,
fails to eliminate group differences.
Consequently, social pressure alone
cannot explain group differences in ambivalence.

The second variable considered in
this table is influence of a recent experience. Approximately 20 per cent of both
groups were strongly influenced and approximately 10 per cent were somewhat
influenced by a recent experience in
making their termination decision. The
great majority of these experiences related to unwanted pregnancy, abortion,
health problems during pregnancy, or
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

current child’s health problems. Differences between groups are not significant. Consequently, recent experiences alone cannot explain differences
between groups regarding ambivalence
of the termination decision.

Logically, interest in having another
baby should be closely correlated with
uncertainty regarding the termination
decision. Table 5 presents data on this
variable. It indicates that, although

there is a slightly greater percentage of
evasectomy versus tubal ligation women
awho are greatly or moderately intercested in another child (10.2 per cent ver“SUS 5.5 per cent), differences between
roups are not significant. Moreover,
Cfurther analysis of variance on differSences in ambivalence (both measures)
“between tubal ligation and vasectomy
=proups, controlling for interest in anSpther child, fails to eliminate group dif‘clerences. Consequently, although interest in having another baby is a very
simportant predictor of uncertainty in

Sjubal ligation groups.

reason is also indicated. The higher the
value of the mean, the more important
the reason. Reasons are ordered according to mean value of responses for tubal
ligation women. With few exceptions,
this rank ordering is similar to that for
vasectomy wives. There are very few
significant differences between the two
groups: “Desire to work” is more important to tubal ligation than to vasectomy women; this difference decreases
(but does not disappear) after controlling for work status. However, controlling for this variable in analyses of variance fails to eliminate group differences
in certainty. The only other reason considered at least moderately important,
which varies significantly between
groups, even after controlling for sociodemographic differences, is ‘“husband doesn’t want any more children.”
Not only is this reason significantly more
important to vasectomy wives, its mean
value—3.10—is the highest among the
items rated by the vasectomy sample. It
ranks sixth in the tubal ligation listing.
However, further analysis of variance
on differences in certainty between
groups, controlling for the mean impor‘tance of this reason, fails to eliminate
differences between groups. In addition
to ranking each reason according to its
importance, subjects were also asked to

choose the one reason which was most
salient in their decision to terminate
childbearing. Further analyses based on
these data indicate that “husband does
not want any more children” alone,
when used as a control variable, eliminates group differences in one measure
of ambivalence (mixed feelings). Thus,
motivation data indicate that the most
importance difference between groups
is the salience, among vasectomy wives,
of husband’s feelings.

Table 7 provides data on couple dynamics involved in the decision-making

process, as perceived by the wife. These
data indicate that there was conflict between spouses in approximately 15 per
cent of the cases (no significant differences between groups). What is most interesting and important is that the role
taken by the wife in the tubal ligation
group is much stronger than that assumed by vasectomy wives, whereas
male input is much greater in the vasectomy than in the tubal ligation group.
Fifty-one per cent of wives initiated discussion in the tubal ligation group compared to 33 per cent of wives in the vas

significant, even after controlling for

ligation and vasectomy groups, controlling for either “‘which spouse wanted to

more influence,” eliminates group differences in both measures of ambivalence (mixed feelings and degree of certainty); however, group differences in
degree of certainty still remain close to
levels of significance.

These data indicate that the differential roles played by spouses in making

are related to ambivalence. Consequently, couple-dynamics variables will
be examined more closely as indicators
of perceived spousal “dominance” over
the termination decision. Because the
variable on initiative was shown not to
add explanatory power beyond that
contributed by the other two variables
(“wanted to end childbearing more”
and “had more influence’’), it was not
considered further.

The question to be further explored
is: Do differences in couple decisionmaking dynamics with respect to which
spouse dominated the termination decision account for differences in ambivalence between groups? In order to answer this question, the two measures of
ambivalence presented in Table 2 were
cross-tabulated with responses to the
following variables: which spouse (1)
wanted to end childbearing more and
(2) had more influence. As indicated in
Tables 8 and 9, current uncertainty and
mixed feelings following the decision
are significantly associated with husband responses for the sample as a
whole, but particularly for the vasectomy group. This factor has a weaker effect within the tubal ligation sample.
Wife and equal-role responses are generally similar (see mean values) and are
significantly more positive than those in
the husband category. For example, 71
per cent of the tubal ligation women
whose husbands wanted to end childbearing more were completely certain of
their decision, compared to 87 per cent
of the women in the two other subgroups. In the vasectomy group, only 49
per cent of the women whose husbands
wanted to end childbearing more were
completely certain of their decision,
compared to 86 per cent and 89 per cent,

Social Biology

respectively, for the wife and equal-role
subgroups.

These data clearly illustrate that the
husband-response group is distinct from
both the equal- and wife-response group
and should be explored in further detail.
Consequently, further detailed analyses, including construction of an index
measuring extent of control, focus on
the effects of perceived male dominance. The index used in these analyses
is based on the three best predictors of
group differences in ambivalence: (1)
husband wanted to end childbearing
more, (2) husband had more influence,
and (3) selection of “husband wanted no
more children” as the most important
reason for terminating childbearing.

For each subject, the following computation was made: The number of male
responses and selection of the reason
“husband wanted no more children” as
the most important reason was multiplied by (—1) for a maximum of three
responses; responses indicating either
female or equal roles or selection of another primary reason were assigned the
value of zero. A (—1) value indicated
slight male control; a (—2) value, moderate control; a (—3) value, extensive
male control; and 0, either equal or female control. Because of the relatively
small number of cases with a (—3) value,
(—2) and (—3) were combined into one
category, called extensive male control.
Distribution of the sample into these
three categories (see Table 10) indicates
that the decision to terminate childbearing was perceived to be dominated by
the male in 12 per cent of tubal ligation
versus 32 per cent of the vasectomy
group (p=0.000). Perhaps even more
importantly, 20 per cent of the vasectomy group compared to only 4 per cent

related to prevalence of mixed feelings
after the termination decision was
made. Thus, only 11 per cent of the
tubal ligation women whose spouses did
not dominate the termination decision
experienced strong mixed feelings or
conflict, compared to 19 per cent and 30
per cent of those subjects whose spouses
exerted slight and extensive control, respectively. In the vasectomy sample, 12
per cent of women who either dominated the decision or who participated
equally with their spouses experienced
strong mixed feelings or conflict, compared to 14 per cent and 49 per cent of
women whose husbands exerted slight
and extensive control.

The effect of extensive male dominance on the decision is slightly more
powerful (differences are not significant) among vasectomy than tubal ligation subjects. As in the case of current
certainty regarding the termination decision, controlling for extent of perceived male dominance eliminates differences in mixed feelings between
groups (the initial p value of 0.01 [see
Table 2] becomes 0.41).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Data presented in this paper indicate
that tubal ligation women are more certain of their decision to terminate childbearing than are their vasectomy counterparts. This difference could not be
explained by any of the following factors
considered alone: sociodemographic
variables, time and discussion variables,
external constraints on the decision, interest in having another child, nor by
most motivating factors for the decision.

Motivation and couple dynamics
data, however, clearly indicated that
significantly more tubal ligation than
vasectomy women played an active role

Social Biology

in the termination decision, whereas
significantly more men in the vasectomy
than in the tubal ligation group were
perceived to be salient in this regard.

Cross-tabulation of male, female,
and equal-role responses to ambivalence indicated that perceived male
dominance was the key variable explaining group differences. An index was
constructed to study these effects in
greater detail. It was first determined
that there was a significantly higher percentage of termination decisions extensively dominated by the male in the vasectomy than in the tubal ligation group.
Further detailed analyses indicated that
current uncertainty was closely correlated with male, particularly extensive
male, control of the termination decision. Extensive male dominance was
also most significantly related to mixed
feelings following the decision in both
tubal ligation and vasectomy groups. Final analyses indicated that group differences in both measures of ambivalence
were eliminated after controlling for extent of male dominance.

These results strongly indicate that
differences in ambivalence between vasectomy wives and tubal ligation women
are largely due to the effects of strong
male control of the termination decision
and the disproportionate prevalence of
this pattern among vasectomy couples.
Although extent of male control plays
the predominant role in accounting for
group differences, there is also an interaction effect between male dominance
and group membership with regard to
present feelings of certainty and a similar trend between extreme male dominance and group membership with regard to mixed feelings. Vasectomy
wives whose husbands dominated the
decision were more ambivalent in their
decision to terminate childbearing than

 

 
 

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

were their tubal ligation counterparts.
Perhaps this is because ambivalence on
the woman’s part is more readily minimized. The male can make the decision
with only token participation on his
wife’s part and proceed to sterilization
with or without her approval. In the case
of tubal ligation, the wife’s participation
is obviously more central to the decision.

The relationship of study results to
future dissatisfaction may usefully be
“considered under two types of circumstances: (1) continuity of the existing
marriage and (2) dissolution of the existding marriage. In the first case, dissatis
gofaction is likely to be more prevalent
among vasectomy wives than among

=tubal ligation women because the

~former are less likely to have exerted
control over the decision and were more
Slikely to be ambivalent. On the other
hand, tubal ligation women who domi‘Snated the termination decision may ex‘6perience dissatisfaction if their spouses
feel and express resentment because of

stheir secondary role in the decision. In.

‘cases of marital breakup, the vasectomy
wife whose husband controlled the decission should feel little regret; these
gwomen were most ambivalent, but they

lent, but were persuaded by their
spouses to undergo sterilization. In addition, those vasectomy wives who convinced their reluctant spouses to be sterilized may wish they had undergone the
surgery themselves.

These and other hyotheses will be
tested when follow-up data are analyzed. If proven correct, these hypotheses will have the following implications
for preoperative sterilization counseling: (1) It is important that both partners
be counseled. (2) In situations where
One spouse clearly dominates the decision, counseling should be particularly
thorough, focusing on the potential for
future regret and implications this may
have for marital stability and satisfaction. (3) In situations where marital instability is suspected, dissatisfaction
may be minimized if sterilization is either postponed or at least undertaken by
the spouse who wants to end childbearing most. The counselor could explore
how marital dissolution may affect regret of the termination decision, particularly if the more ambivalent spouse underwent the surgery.
