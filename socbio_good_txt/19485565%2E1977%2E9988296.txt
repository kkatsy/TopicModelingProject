Separation of Common Environment and

Dominance Effects with Classic

Kinship Correlation Models

ABSTRACT: Common family environmental effect (y?) and dominance effect (d9 are usually
confounded; either or both may make the sib-sib correlation larger than the parent-child correlation. The classic three kinship correlations (parent-parent, parent-offspring, sib-sib) can accommodate either dominance (Model D) or common family environment effects (Model C), but not
both. The relationship between the various components of the three correlations of Models D and
C are given. In order to include both dominance and common family environment effects, a

fourth correlation, that between half-sibs, is added
dominance effects from the common family env

ue system which enables us to separate the
nment effects. Half-sibs may constitute a

potentially new source material for study of qu -ntitative inheritance. The principle of the
constant heredity/environment ratio is discussed.

The voluminous data on human quantitative inheritance show that the sib-sib
correlation is usually larger than the
parent-child correlation. Wright (1952, p.
18) notes: “The fraternal correlation may
exceed the parent-offspring correlation
either because of dominance or because of
a higher environmental correlation, or
both, making evaluation very difficult in
natural populations.” This communication attempts to separate the common
family environmental effects from dominance effects by the use of classic kinship
correlation models. The correlation formulas are accompanied by path diagrams for
easy comprehension. An elementary exposition of the path method may be found
in Li (1975), while the original treatise regarding genetic applications may be found
in Wright (1921; also 1968-69).

BASIC VARIABLES AND
HERITABILITY

Let Y be the genotype value, ignoring
the environmental effects for the moment.

By the method of least squares, these Y
values may be subdivided into linear (or
fitted) values ZL and a deviation D from
linearity. Thus, Y = ZL + D, where Z and
D are uncorrelated by virtue of the least
square fitting procedure. Such D values
are called the dominance deviations. If Y
were linear to begin with, then Y = LZ and
D = O, and we would say that there is no
dominance. The model Y = L + Disa
self-contained one.

Next, let E be the environmental effect
on the measurements of the quantitative
trait, and let us assume that it is additive
(at least approximately) to the genotype
value. So the observed phenotype value is
Z = Y + E, which is another selfcontained subsystem. In classic models, it
is assumed that Y and £ are uncorrelated.
For human quantitative traits, it may or
may not be true, depending on the particular trait under study. Although we shall
adopt classic models in this communication, the effects of the correlation between
Y and E will be discussed at the end of the

paper.

Fic. 1.—Path relations of the five variables (capital letters ZL, D, Y, E, Z), The lower-case letters (g, d,
h, e) associated with arrows are path coefficients. For
this particular causal scheme, the path coefficients
are simply the correlation coefficients between the
two adjacent variables concerned. The correlation
coefficients are, in turn, the ratio of the standard
deviation of a “cause” to the standard deviation of an
“effect” in the path diagram. Thus, g = a,/oy, d =
a, oy, andhk = aj/az,e = o,/az, so thatg?+d?=1,
and kh? + e? = 1.

The two self-contained subsystems (Y =
LE +DandZ =Y + E) may be joined to
form one system as indicated in Figure 1.
Let r(A,B) denote the correlation between
A and B. The assumptions 7(Z,D) = 0 and
r(Y,E) = 0 lead to

oy? = 01? + op,

Oz" = Oy? + of’.
Elementary statistics on linear regression
and correlation (e.g., Li, 1975) leads to the
following results:

g = r(L,Y) = Ozloy,
d= r(D,Y) = Cploy,
g? +d? = 1.

Similarly,

= o{Y,Z) = oyloz,
é= r(E,Z) = Cr/oz,
h? + e2 = 1.

The first set of results refers to the left
portion (L + D = Y) of Figure 1; the
second set refers to the right portion (Y +
E = Z) of that diagram. The values of g,
d, and h, e are called path coefficients.
Thus, e is the path coefficient from the

Social Biology

cause E (random environment) to the effect Z (phenotype value). These path coefficients also happen to be correlation coefficients in the particular case in which
the causes are uncorrelated.

From Figure 1 it is clear that the fraction g? (or d*) depends only on the degree
of dominance (having nothing to do with
environmental effects), and the fraction h?
(or e”) depends only on the magnitude of
environmental effects (having nothing to
do with dominance). There is no necessary
relationship between these two fractions;
each may be large or small. The following
names have been proposed for these fractions (Li, 1975, p. 254):

g? = o,2/oy?
= dominance heritability,

h? = oy7/az?
= environmental heritability (“broad”),

gh? = 012/07?
= combined heritability (‘narrow’).

One may not like these names; the author
himself is reluctant to propose new verbal
names. The main point is, however, that
the two fractions g? and /? have entirely
two different meanings and should be kept
apart and, whenever possible, should be
estimated separately in empirical studies.

The fractions g? and h? enter into the
expressions for various kinship correlations either jointly or separately, so that
we have to deal with three fractions: g?,
kh? and g%?. The usual terminology—
broad and narrow heritability—is inadequate, as two names cannot accommodate
three quantities. We need a name for g? to
describe the dominance effect. In a simplified model of additive gene effects (no
dominance), we have (Fig. 1)ZL = Y, D =
0, yielding g = 1, d = O. In such a case,
g*h? = h?, which may simply be called
heritability (as there is no longer any distinction between “broad” and “narrow”).

KINSHIP CORRELATION MODELS
D AND C

Let us first examine Model D: There is
dominance but no common family environmental effects (Fig. 2). Let rpp(Z,Z) =
Ypp be the observed correlation between
the two parents’ phenotypes (at the Z
level). This is the primary source of assortative mating. Let rpg and 7g be the observed (at the phenotype Z level) parentoffspring and sib-sib correlations, respectively. From Figure 2 we may express the
three observed correlations as follows:

Ypp = mig*h?, (D1)

+ (1 + rpp)gh?, (D2)

Ypo

Yoo = > + m) g? + fart as
(D3)

+ + g? + 2m g%)h?.

These are the classical results of Fisher
(1918), in which pe = rpp, C, = h?, co = g?,
and A = ¢,Cy wp = h*g? rpp = m. These
three equations will enable us to solve for
m, g*, h?in terms of the observed correlations. Note that Fisher’s parent-child corfelation does not contain the dominance
fraction d*. Further, for the sib-sib correlation, Fisher assumes that assortative
mating increases the linear component
from % g? to % (1 + m)g”, but the dominance component 4 d? remains the same
as in random mating populations.

The real situation with assortative mating is probably more complicated than
indicated (Crow and Felsenstein, 1968).
Wright (1952, p. 18) points out: “Assortative mating introduces a correlation between dominance deviations of parents
and offspring and between dominance
deviations of either and additive deviations of the other. Accurate deduction of
heritability thus becomes practically im

Fic. 2.—Path relations among family members
(Model D). The upper two individuals are parents
and the lower two are full sibs. The random environment EZ has been omitted from the diagram as it
contributes nothing to the kinship correlations. The
parental D values have been omitted for the same
reason, but the offspring D values are shown because
they contribute to the correlation between full sibs.

possible if there is appreciable assortative
mating in the presence of dominance.” We
cite the classic formulas (D’s) of Fisher,
because many empirical estimates (e.g.,
Burt and Howard, 1956) were made on
the basis of these formulas. Whenever the
fraternal correlation is larger than the
parent-child correlation, the D model will
always yield a high degree of dominance (g
small), and thus high heritability (4 large).
Indeed, these are the two major conclusions of Burt and Howard (1956). Jensen
(1969) follows the same vein.

Now, let us consider Model C: There is
no dominance, but there is a common
family environment factor (denoted by T°
in Fig. 3). Analytically, this is to assume Y
= L, D = O, and thus g = 1. Then, the
three observed correlations are, according
to Figure 3:

In using Model C, we note ko? + e527 + y?
= 1 for the complete determination of the
child’s phenotype (Wright, 1921, p. 116).
This is also the model adopted by Li (1975,
p. 324) in analyzing Jencks et al.’s (1972)
data on kinship correlations.

Fic. 3.—Path relations among family members
(Model C), the general features remaining the same
as in Figure 2 but with two modifications: no dominance, L = Y, and thus g = 1, d = 0. A variable Tis
introduced to represent the common family environment which contributes to the correlation between
full sibs.

There are, of course, other ways of expressing the influence of the common family environment on sib-sib correlation. In
lieu of the separate I’ factor, we may introduce a correlation between the environments of full sibs reared together, viz.,
y(E,E). This correlation preserves the relationship h? + e? = 1, but the environmental factor E no longer represents inci

dental as well as accidental environmental
effects uncorrelated with each other or
with genotype value Y. In any case, as far
as its contribution to sib-sib correlation is
concerned, y? = e? - r(E,£).

Now we are in a position to compare the
Models D and C. For a given set of observed values of (rpp, Ypo, Yoo), it will be
found that m) = m. That is, the genetic
correlation between the parents remains
the same in both models. The relationships between the other components of the
two models are:

hy? = g*h? = 2rpoh(1 + Ypp), (CD1)
eg = Sd"? + e2, (CD2)
y= ah? (CD3)

Thus, Model C always yields a smaller
heritability than Model D, as h,? < h?.
Part of the dominance effects, 4 d*h?, of
Model D becomes the common family environment effect y? of Model C. The random environmental effects of Model C is
always larger than that of Model D, as
indicated by (CD2). The three expressions
above represent a reshuffling of the various effects between the two models.

HALF-SIB CORRELATION

With three observed correlations, we
can only solve for three unknowns. Thus,
Model D includes g? but not y*, Model C
includes y* but takes g = 1. In order to
include both g? and y’, a fourth observed
correlation providing the fourth equation
will be needed. However, it is not automatically sufficient to obtain the correlation between any other relatives. For instance, the correlation between grandparent and grandchild is (Fisher, 1918):

r(GP,GC) = + (1 + m)(1 + rpp)g?h?.

This expression involves two unknowns,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 4

m and g*k*, which may be solved from
previous equations for rpp and rpo. In
other words, the equation provided by
7(GP,GC) merely makes a part of the system “over-determined,” leaving the remaining part “under-determined.”

The simplest kinship correlation that
yields a fourth equation independent of
the previous three is that between half-sibs
reared together (Fig. 4). In calculating the
half-sib correlation (see [4] below), only
the linear values of the three parents and
their genetic correlation m are needed.
Note that in Figure 4 it is assumed the
genetic correlation between L, and L,(two
fathers, say) is also m, the same as that
between mates (L, Lo) and mates (Lo, L2).
This is equivalent to assuming that the
second mate is chosen from the same subpopulation or assortative group as the first
mate, without any particular change in
her mating behavior. The correlation between two individuals depends upon the
group from which they are chosen and

does not depend on sex or marriage. Since
L,and L, are chosen from the same assortative group of mates, they are correlated
to the same extent. Rao, Morton, and Yee
(1974, 1976), in studying half-sib correlation models, have made the same assumption, taking the genetic correlation between L, and L, to be m also.

However, since the correlation 7(L ,, L 3)
depends on the mating behavior of the
common parent Ly, a genera] model may
be devised to yield a range of possible 7(L,,
LL.) values between m and m? (Wright,
personal communication). On the other
extreme, Loehlin (personal communication) points out that if the second mate is
chosen as closely resembling the first as
possible, then the correlation between the
two fathers would be larger, not smaller,
than m. In view of all these possibilities,
the writer, concurring with Rao, Morton,
and Yee (1974), thinks that in the assortative mating population as a whole, the
assumption that the successive mates are
chosen from the same subpopulation is
still the most reasonable one.

Let 9-9 be the observed correlation between half-sibs. Then the four equations
for the four unknowns (m, g, h, ‘y) are:

Tpp = mlg*h?, (1)
Ypo = + (1 + rpp)g*h?, (2)
Yoo = + (1 + m)g?h? + + ah? +y¥.
(3)
r= ly 2p 2 2
Yoo 4 (1 + 3m)g*h? + y?. (4)

These equations are easily solved, thus
enabling us to separate the effects of the
common family environment (y?) and
dominance (g? = 1 — d%4. It may seem

plausible to estimate y? by the correlation
between unrelated children reared together. Such estimates are in practice always too high because of the unavoidable

264

selection (known or unknown) process involved in adoption. Half-sibs are born,
not artificially selected. The practical difficulty in using half-sib correlation is its
paucity in literature, but the situation may
change in the near future. With early
marriage, early divorce, and early remarriage, there are now a large number of
half-sibs in the population. The problem is
how to seek them out. The half-sibs will
constitute a potential source material for
various types of studies.

There is possibly another type of selection bias in studying half-sibs. Example:
Nichols (1970, cited by Loehlin et al.,
1975, p. 119) reported, with respect to
height, the correlation for full sibs is 0.25
but that for half-sibs is 0.43. This is consistent neither with heredity nor with environment but may be explained by selecting similar half-sibs by the sampling process of the study.

A final precaution in using the four
equations (1-4) is that the four kinship
correlations must be obtained from the
same population, or better still, from the
same families. A family may have both
full sibs and half-sibs.

DISCUSSION

In the early section on “basic variables
and heritability’ we noted the classic
models assume the genotype value Y and
environment factor E to be uncorrelated.
Now suppose that Y and £ are correlated
to the extent s = r(Y,E). Then, instead of
h* + e? = 1, we would have

h?+2hse +e? =1 (5)
for the complete determination of a phenotype. Due to the presence of the term 2 hse
in (5), the new values of h2.and e* would be
smaller than before. Since s < 1, however,
the direct contribution (h2 + e4 is always
greater than the joint contribution (2 /se).

If heredity and environment influence
the phenotype the same way whether they

are correlated or not, then the ratio h/e
(and thus also the ratio 17/e%) should remain the same whether Y and E are correlated or not. This principle of constant
path coefficient ratio has been employed
by Wnght (1931) when he formulates a
new equation by transferring the ratio of
two path coefficients of one situation to
another. A numerical demonstration of
this property was provided by Li (1975, p.
133) in which fp p, = 0.60193/0.32103 for
correlated causes; and p./p, = 0.76847/
0.40985 for uncorrelated causes. In either
case, the ratio is p./p, = 1.875.

The principle of constant ratio for path
coefficients enables us to convert a path
coefficient of one situation to that of another. From (5), h? + e? = 1 — 2 hse.
Dividing both sides by 1 — 2 hse, we obtain

h2 pn?
1 — 2hse t

i—2hse
which amounts to
2 2

ht + 72 =

h* +e h? +e
assuming the form (h’)? + (e’)? = 1 for
uncorrelated causes. Rao et al. (1974,
1976) make use of this principle extensively. Their 0, in this simple case, is

6=/V1—2hse >1

so that

h' =hé.

They use @ as a converting factor, without
changing the ratios of the path coefficients, as h’/e’ = hile.

The lesson derived from the discussion
above is clear. If we are interested in the
absolute values of #2 and e?, then we have
to use Model (5) where § = 7(Y,E). This
would complicate the correlation formulas. If we are merely interested in the relative maghitudes of 2 and e?, then the
classic models (with uncorrelated Y and £)
will setve the putpdse. We might think
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 4

that the assumption s = r(Y,£Z) = 0 would
make the estimates of h? and e? completely
useless. Fortunately, this is not the case.

The existence of the genotype-environment correlation has yet another consequence. For any given heredity/environment ratio, the genotype-environment correlation s = 7(Y,£) increases the genotype-phenotype correlation r(Y,Z) =h +
se. For numerical demonstrations, we take
h? = 4 e? purely for arithmetic convenience in Table 1. It is seen that as s in

creases, the genotype-phenotype correlation 7(Y,Z) also increases, despite the decrease of h? and e?. The same is true for
the environment-phenotype correlation
r(E,Z) =e +sh. In the limiting cases = 1,
the variance components are (22, e”, 2 hse)

are unity.

SUMMARY

Dominance and common home environmental effects are usually confounded;

Environment and Dominance Effects 265

either or both can make the sib-sib correlation higher than the parent-child correlation. The main purpose of this communication is to present simple ways by
which the dominance and common environment can be separated.

In formulating the kinship correlations,
the classic approach was adopted, assuming the genotype and environment to be
uncorrelated. Two preliminary sets of expressions are given. Model D allows for
dominance but not for common home environment. Model C allows for common
home environment but not for dominance.
The relationship between the various
components of these two models are given
in full.

In order to include both common home
environment and dominance in kinship
correlations, we need four observed
correlations (parent-parent, parentchild, sib-sib, half-sibs) to solve for the
four unknowns: g2 = dominance heritability, #2 = environmental heritability,
m = genetic correlation between parents,
and y? = common home environmental
effects. The addition of the half-sib correlation enables us to achieve the separation
of g? and y”.

The defect of the classic models in assuming genotype and environment to be
uncorrelated has been discussed. It was
noted that the genotype-environment correlation may decrease the values of h? and
e*? but does not change their ratio h %e?. In
estimating the heredity/environment ratio,
the simpler models are still useful.
