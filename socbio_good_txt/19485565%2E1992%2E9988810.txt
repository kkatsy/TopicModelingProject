"SABSTRACT: Studies of infant and child mortality have evolved to distinguish between two sets of
‘explanatory variables—factors related to reproductive or maternal characteristics and socioeco
omic factors, generally described as characteristics of the family or household. Almost all
odnultivariate analyses include variables from each of these two sets, but there has been little
Stonsideration of the relationship between them. We examine how these two sets of variables
jointly affect mortality. We test first for confounded effects by examining socioeconomic effects
“while excluding and then including reproductive variables in nested multivariate models. Next,
swe look for age-dependent effects among the explanatory variables and find that reproductive

nd socioeconomic factors affect mortality at differing ages of children. Finally, we examine
Spteractive effects of the two sets of variables. We conclude that the higher mortality observed
‘among the low status groups is not a result of greater concentration of poor reproductive patterns
‘in those groups. Instead, higher status groups probably have more resources available for
Seombating the negative effects of the same high-risk reproductive patterns.

elated to reproductive or maternal
Sbharacteristics and socioeconomic fac‘dors, generally described as character‘dstics of the family or household into
Avhich the infant is born. The associaAion between socioeconomic factors
and infant mortality has been well documented in the demographic literature
(Meegama, 1980; Somoza, 1980;
D’Souza and Bhuiya, 1982; Farah and
Preston, 1982; Frenzen and Hogan,
1982; Thapa and Retherford, 1982;
Martin et al., 1983; Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983; DaVanzo et al.,
1983; Hobcraft et al., 1983; Hobcraft
et al., 1984; Rutstein, 1984; Al-Kabir,
1984; Timaeus, 1984). Numerous stud
ies have also documented the relationship between reproductive factors and
infant mortality (Wray, 1971; Nortman, 1974; Wolfers and Scrimshaw,
1975; DeVanzo et al., 1983; Cleland
and Sathar, 1984; DeSweemer, 1984;
Hobcraft et al., 1985; Palloni and Millman, 1986; Pebley and Stupp, 1987).
Almost all analyses of infant and
child mortality include variables from
each of these two sets of factors because both have been found to contribute greatly to explanations of population variation in infant and child
mortality. What is less well understood
is the relationship between these two
sets of factors as they affect mortality.
Our objective is to examine the extent
to which reproductive and socioeconomic factors jointly affect infant and
child mortality and to elucidate how fu

ture analyses of survey data might proceed.

CONFOUNDED EFFECTS

The observed effects of socioeconomic characteristics may be confounded with those of reproductive
characteristics if the effects of the socioeconomic factors can be significantly changed when particular reproductive variables are included in the
analysis. For example, if infants born
to young mothers face a greater risk of
death, and less privileged women tend
to have children at young ages, then
the higher infant mortality among poor
mothers could be attributed to the age
at which they give birth and not to the
fact that they are poor. This hypothesis
holds that much of the relatively high
infant mortality among lower socioeconomic groups can be attributed to their
more dangerous patterns of childbearing, relative to higher socioeconomic
groups rather than to the fact that they
have poorer living conditions.

Using data from a rural area of
north India, we address the question of
whether socioeconomic differentials in
mortality can be accounted for by differences in reproductive patterns
among various levels of the social
structure. In a similar analysis, DaVanzo and colleagues (1983) found that
mortality differentials by ethnic group
are diminished when the effects of low
birth weight and birth interval length
are controlled in multivariate analysis.
Frenzen and Hogan (1982) reported
that when parity, mother’s age, and
birth interval effects are controlled, social class differentials and regional differentials remain, but significant differentials by mother’s education are
diminished.

 

Social Biology

INTERACTIVE EFFECTS

Reproductive and socioeconomic
factors may have interactive effects on
mortality. For example, maternal age
may have a stronger effect on the risk
of infant and child mortality if the
mother is in an economically disadvantaged household than if she is in an advantaged one. One interpretation of
such a finding is that children born into
poor households have more difficulty
overcoming negative effects of their
mother’s age than those born into
higher status households.

AGE-DEPENDENT EFFECTS

It is well recognized that the risk of
mortality varies substantially within
the first years of life. Because infant
and child deaths are concentrated in
the first months of life, all multivariate
analyses that examine the determinants of mortality in the first few years
of life include age at death in the models. Yet age at death is often included
only as a control variable so that its effects are assumed to be independent of
the other variables included in the
analysis; in fact, the parameter estimates of age are often not presented.
This strategy assumes that the effects
of the other variables included in the
model do not vary by age. But, there is
increasing evidence that further advances in our understanding of the determinants of infant and child mortality
will result from examining the age dependent effects of both socioeconomic
and reproductive factors (Trussell and
Hammerslough, 1987; DaVanzo et al.,
1983; Martin et al., 1983).

In Indonesia and Pakistan, Martin
et al. (1983) found that children born
to women in the highest category of ed

ucation faced lowered risks of mortality after the first month of life. Trussell
and Hammerslough (1983) and DaVanzo et al. (1983) also found that mother’s education had a larger effect on
mortality after the first month of life.
Similar age-dependent effects were
found for other socioeconomic factors.

In addition, previous research has
shown that mortality at different ages
may be caused by different factors. In
comparative analysis of World Fertility
Survey data (Hobcraft et al., 1984 and
1985), where separate models were estimated for neonatal, post-neonatal,
toddler (1 to 2 year), and the third year
of life, effects of socioeconomic and reproductive factors varied substantially
by the age of the child.

In this analysis, we look first for potential confounding of reproductive
and socioeconomic effects on mortality
by examining the reproductive patterns of childbearing by socioeconomic
status. We then look for agedependent effects among the explanatory variables and find that the effects
of reproductive and socioeconomic
factors at different ages shed light on
how to proceed in the analysis of interactive effects of these two sets of
variables.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this analysis come from a
rural population in the district of Ludhiana, located in central Punjab, India. Ludhiana, and Punjab in general,
is a relatively prosperous region of India. The majority of the population are
of the Sikh religion, but the area also
has a substantial Hindu, Muslim, and
Christian minority (25 per cent). The
largest economically and_ politically

dominant ethnic/caste group are the
Jat Sikh, a high-caste land-owning
group. Non-Jats, or lower caste Sikhs,
also form a large part of the population. Non-Jats typically do not own
land and work as hired Jabor or share
croppers on Jat farms. There is no intermarriage between the castes.

The data used in this analysis were
collected while the Narangwal health
project was being conducted in this region. This project was carried out by
the Indian Council of Medical Research and researchers from Johns
Hopkins University in three development blocks in Ludhiana during 1968
to 1974 and covered a total population
of 35,000 in 26 villages. The Narangwal
project was composed of two separate
experimental health interventions with
different objectives. The primary objective of the health and nutrition
project was to assess the effectiveness
of integrated medical and nutrition
programs on child health and survival.
The primary objective of the family
planning program was to determine
whether integration of family planning
services with women’s and children’s
health services was more effective than
a stand-alone family planning program. Investigations of the effects of
the interventions on mortality in the
study area were conducted by Kielmann et al. (1978) and Amin (1988).

During the interventions, data on
health, mortality, fertility, health service utilization, and socioeconomic status were collected through continuous
record systems, longitudinal surveys,
and cross-sectional retrospective surveys. The data we employ for this analysis come from a retrospective fertility
survey which included a complete
pregnancy history. This survey was
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

142 Kost and Amin

then cross-checked with and supplemented by information collected in a
longitudinal fertility survey conducted
during the intervention. All information on socioeconomic status comes
from a socioeconomic survey which
was administered in two rounds to a
large subsample of the study population.

Although the Narangwal data con- |

tain more than 23 ,000 births, our analyses are based on 9,185 births. Several
restrictions on the data resulted in the

smaller sample size. First of all, we in- |

cluded only births which occurred not
more than 15 years before the survey
interview, births from 1958 to 1973.
Secondly, only observations which included information from the separate
socioeconomic survey could be included. Third, our analyses excluded
first births because risks associated
with birth interval length and survival
of the previous birth, two factors of
major interest in this analysis, are not
relevant for first births.

To estimate the effects of socioeconomic and reproductive factors on
child survival we use a multivariate extension of life tables known as hazard
models. We provide only a brief description of these models as more detailed treatments of hazard models applied to demographic data are given
elsewhere (Menken et al., 1981; Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983).

The dependent variable in our analysis iS a measure of the force of mortality for an individual i, in age interval
t and is given by u(t). The hazard in
age interval 1, which can be interpreted
as the probability of dying between f
and delta-t given that the child has survived to the start of the age interval, is
assumed to have the following func

tional form:

where y(t) is the risk of dying in age
interval ¢ for child 7, the exponentiated
first term, exp(a(t)), is the underlying
age-specific risks of dying, X,jf) is a
vector of characteristics for individual
i, and Q(t) is the set of associated coefficients. Estimates of the coefficients
B(1), when exponentiated, can be interpreted as the risk associated with a set
of characteristics X,(t), relative to an
omitted reference category. All variables in this analysis are coded as categorical variables. Coefficients are estimated using maximum likelihood
methods, and we use Z-statistics (the
estimated coefficient divided by its
standard error) to assess whether an effect is statistically significant.

VARIABLES USED IN THE ANALYSIS

In all analyses, we control for the
sex of the child since mortality varies
substantially by sex in this region and
because there 1s strong evidence of sex
preference in the Punjab (Amin and
Pebley, 1987). We also control for the
time period in which the child is born
(mortality rates fell in all villages over
the period of time covered by the retrospective surveys) and for the effects
of the intervention projects. The period variable we use is designed to capture the effects of both the time period
of birth and the intervention.!

'The omitted category for the period effect is
births between 1958 and 1963. Period 2 includes all
births between 1963 and the start of the intervention. Interventions began at the end of 1968 in most
villages. Since some of the births in period 2 spent
part of the first three years of life in an intervention
village, the period 2 category is not completely devoid of the intervention effect. Period 3 includes
births that took place after the interventions began.

The reproductive factors included in
the analyses are mother’s age at childbirth, birth order, and a four category
variable constructed to represent both
birth interval length (= 15 months and
> 15 months) and the survival status of
the previous birth (alive or died) because we expect death of previous child
to be strongly associated with birth interval length—some short birth inter
‘ovals being caused by the death of a
Schild. A previous child death may also
measure family effects that cause all
births i in the family to face higher risks
Sof death. In this analysis we chose to
include previous child death with the
Sreproductive variables even though
this could increase the chance of find“ing a confounding effect of reproducStive factors.
S The socioeconomic factors include
oN “
-smother’s education, head of houseshold’s education, family income, and
wscaste. These factors were coded into
pdichotomous categories to represent
Zlow and high socioeconomic groups.
.2Mother’s education was coded as some
or none since 89 per cent of women had
sno education. Head of household’s edrgucation was also coded as some or none
gsince 60 per cent of the household
heads had no education. Although we
ewere constrained by our data to use
Chead of household’s educational status
rather than the father’s, we find this
constraint preferable since the person
who heads the household may have
more of an influence over the environment into which a child 1s born than the
child’s father.

For the caste variable, we distin

since Non-Jats constitute the lowest
and largest caste group. The family income variable was constructed from a
composite score of several income and
assets variables, such as income in rupees and cash value of crops harvested
(see Amin, 1988).

RESULTS

As a first step in examining the relationship of the socioeconomic and reproductive factors to mortality, we examined bivariate plots of the estimated
risk of death, or “hazard,” from 0 to 36
months of life for each socioeconomic
and reproductive variable by age. Two
general observations emerged from
these plots. First, the four socioeconomic variables— mother’s education,
household head’s education, caste, and
family income—show similar age patterns. The difference in mortality between the low and high socioeconomic
status groups for each variable is least
pronounced in the first 6 months of life
and tends to widen after this age. The
similarity in pattern for all four variables may be explained by a high degree of correjation among the different
measures of socioeconomic status. Rural Punjab families of high caste also
tend to be wealthy and privileged in
terms of access to education.

In contrast to the socioeconomic differentials, the differential effects of reproductive variables tend to dominate
in the first month of life, although birth
order differences appear greater in the
latter half of the first year of life. Bivariate plots of mortality risks tell us
little about how the socioeconomic and
reproductive variables jointly affect
mortality, but the differences in age
patterns of the risk of death suggest

144 Kost and Amin

that the two sets of variables have independent effects on mortality. We examine this possibility in a multivariate
framework later on in the analysis.

Before investigating multivariate effects of socioeconomic and reproductive factors, we examined crosstabulations of births by each of the
reproductive and socioeconomic variables. In this step, we wanted to see
whether such distributions would give
us evidence that socioeconomic effects
on mortality may be confounded by reproductive patterns. The greatest difference in distribution of births for the
lower versus the higher socioeconomic
groups occurs for birth order. For all
four socioeconomic factors, the lower
status group has a greater proportion
of relatively high order births. Also,
the lower status groups have a greater
proportion of previous child deaths.
However, we did not find a significantly greater proportion of births to
young mothers (<20) and only a
slightly higher proportion to older
mothers (35+) in the lower socioeconomic groups. Also, the lower status
births do not appear to be more likely
to be born after short birth intervals
(= 15 months). In sum, we do not find
strikingly different distributions of
births by reproductive factors in the socioeconomic groupings. However,
some variations in reproductive patterns are apparent, and whether or not
these distributional differences will affect socioeconomic mortality differentials can be assessed using nested multivariate models.

To apply a statistical test to the
question of whether socioeconomic effects are confounded by reproduction-related differences in mortality
patterns, we compare two multivariate

 

Social Biology

models, shown in Table 1. In Model 1,
the four socioeconomic effects are estimated controlling only for sex of child
and period of birth. In Model 2 the reproductive variables are added. Comparisons of the estimated effects of socioeconomic factors in Models 1 and 2
allow us to test for a confounding impact of reproductive variables.

We first examine the effects of socloeconomic variables on the risk of
death during the first three years of life
without reproductive factors included
in the model (Model 1, Table 1). The
income differentials we had observed
in bivariate distributions become insignificant once the effects of other socioeconomic factors are accounted for,
but differentials among the three other
socioeconomic factors remain. In this
model, the lower soctoeconomic
groups experience significantly greater
infant and child mortality than the
higher status groups. Children of
mothers with no education and those
from the Non-Jat caste are more than a
third more likely to die than those born
to mothers with some education and
those of higher castes. Those children
who are born into a household where
the head has no education have a 10
per cent greater risk of dying than children in households where the head has
some education.

In Model 2 of Table 1, we test
whether the distributions of the reproductive variables might account for
these socioeconomic differences.
While the effects of almost all the reproductive factors are strong and statistically significant, the effects of the
socioeconomic factors are only mildly
affected by the introduction of the reproductive variables. Low caste children are still more likely to die than

about 25 per cent more likely to die
than children born to women with at
least some education.

In sum, Table 1 shows that the effects of mother’s education, head of
household’s education, and caste are
diminished when reproductive factors
are controlled, but their effects cannot
be completely accounted for by variations in reproductive patterns among
socioeconomic groups.

In the proportional hazard models
in Table 1, we control for a falling risk
of death in the first three years of life
by including a variable for age and by
estimating a separate effect for each
age category—the neonatal period (0
to 1 month), the early post-neonatal
period (2 to 6 months), late postneonatal period (7 to 12 months), the
second year of life, and the third year
of life—and we assume that the relative risks of each of the other covariates are constant across the infant and
child ages. However, since the hazard
distributions we discussed earlier indicate that the differentials associated
with a particular variable are not the
same across all ages, we estimated agespecific relative risks for all the variables. These estimates are equivalent
to including an interaction between age
and each of the covariates in the models and are presented in Table 2. These
estimates are referred to as “‘nonproportional effects” because the effect
estimated for each explanatory variable is no longer constrained to be the
same across age groups.

As we suspected earlier from examining the bivariate distributions of the
hazards, none of the four socioeconomic factors have a discernible effect
on neonatal survival. Instead, the socioeconomic factors tend to affect mor
 

Social Biology

tality later in childhood which suggests
that the risks associated with socioeconomic factors reflect environmental influences on survival such as competition for, and varying quality of,
resources.

Since there are no socioeconomic
differentials in the neonatal period, we
do not expect to see socioeconomic effects confounded by reproductive factors in this age range, and the introduction of the reproductive factors
does not affect the significance of the
socioeconomic factors in the postneonatal ages (Model 2 of Table 2). In
both models presented in Table 2 (excluding and including reproductive factors), infants born to mothers with no
education are about two and one-half
times as likely to die in the second
through sixth months of life than infants born to mothers with some education. Also, mortality after the first
six months of life is significantly affected by head of household’s education, caste, and family income in both
models. Inclusion of the reproductive
factors decreases only slightly the effects of caste and head of household’s
eduction. Examination of nonproportional effects therefore shows that
while the effects of socioeconomic factors vary by age of the child, those effects either do not change or decrease
only slightly with the introduction of
reproductive factors.

The age pattern of mortality differentials by sex and by caste are similar.
In the results presented here, lower
caste and female children have higher
childhood mortality but do not have
significantly higher mortality in the first
six months of life. Girls have significantly higher mortality from 7 to 36
months with about twice the mortality

risk of boys in the second year of life.
The more hazardous environments
faced by low caste and female children
are most likely to blame for their lower
survival, rather than any intrinsic
handicap at birth. We hypothesize that
just as female children may suffer because of a biased distribution of resources within the family, low caste
children suffer because of a biased distribution within the larger social context of the villages.

The period effects are not altered by
the introduction of the reproductive
factors indicating that there has not
been a major shift in reproductive patterns over time or with the advent of
the interventions, although the effects
clearly indicate that mortality risks
have been falling over time. The effects of the last period variable are significant from 7 months through the
third year of life which suggests that
the child health interventions may have
been most effective for children who
survived early infancy.

One finding in particular stands out
in the examination of nested nonproportional models in Table 2, the effect
of mother’s education in early childhood (months 2 through 6). The large
differential in risk for children born to
mothers with some education as compared to those born to mothers with no
education cannot be explained by differing reproductive patterns of the two
groups. Because the education effect
occurs in the same ages as the effects of
reproductive factors, we can look at
the interaction between education and
reproductive factors in Table 3 and test
whether the effects of the reproductive
factors vary by mother’s education
(this is equivalent to a fully interacted
model with mother’s education).

Social Biology

It is clear that children born to
mothers with no education have significantly higher mortality associated with
their reproductive patterns than children born to mothers with at least
some education. Hence, even though
we could not account for soctoeconomic differentials in mortality by differing reproductive patterns, Table 3
indicates that the negative effects of
high birth order, short birth intervals,
and young mothers may be far more
difficult to survive if one is born into a
lower status group.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Socioeconomic factors and factors
associated with mother’s reproductive
patterns are highly associated with survival probabilities in the first years of
life, but the two sets of factors tend to
affect mortality during different times
in a child’s life. In general, socioeconomic factors do not appear to be associated with neonatal mortality, while
reproductive factors dominate only in
the neonatal period and the rest of the
first six months. The only socioeconomic factor that shows a strong and
significant effect in the early infant
ages 1s mother’s education. Because
the reproductive factors are also most
likely to affect mortality at the youngest ages, we examined the interaction
between mother’s education and the
reproductive factors and found that
children born to mothers with no education are less able to overcome the
negative effects associated with a
young mother, high birth order, short
previous birth intervals, and a previous
sibling death. By testing for confounding of reproductive and socioeconomic
effects, variation in effects by age, and

the higher mortality observed among
low status groups is not a result of a
greater concentration of poor reproductive patterns in these groups. Instead, higher status groups probably
