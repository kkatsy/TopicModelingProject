We are in agreement with most of the
points made by Reid. We differ in our
conclusions as to the utility of treating fitness measures as phenotypes in demonstrating the action of selection.

The major point of our earlier article
(Williams and Williams, 1974) was to
demonstrate that Fisher’s (1930) estimate
of the heritability of fertility was in error.
The correlations he used in making his
estimates were due largely or perhaps
totally to secular changes in fertility. Our
minor point was that, on a priori grounds,
we do not expect the heritability of fertility to differ much from zero. It is this
second point which Reid quotes and explores further.

The heritability estimates used by Fisher
were based on correlations between lineal
descent categories and therefore dealt only
with the additive component of variance
in fertility. Selection on an additive component is directional and will act to keep
this component low. In the usual situation,
we would expect the additive component
of fitness to be low enough that, as a practical matter, it could not be shown to dif
fer from zero. This was the reason Fisher’s
estimate needed reinvestigation.

Reid’s demonstration is in accord with
the view that the additive variance should
remain low. Reid goes further and suggests
that a dominance component in fitness may
be revealed by studies of the heritability of
fitness (if heritability is now defined in the
broad sense). We agree; but we point out
that such a dominance component has not
been successfully demonstrated in human
populations. Studies reporting heterosis effects in fertility are few and suffer from the
problem of uncontrolled social variables to
an even greater extent than is the case with
secular change in fertility.

Franz Boas studied the fertility of the
offspring of Indian-white marriages and
compared it to that of Indian and white
controls (Boas, 1894). He found the “hybrid” mothers to have more children than
Indian mothers living in the same villages
(a mean of 7.9 compared to 5.9). Problems
with this study include the fact that only
one parental control (Indian) was present.
Also, his environmental control was simply

that the two sets of families compared
were living in the same villages with approximately the same life style.

Frederick Hulse, in a study of Italianspeaking Swiss in both Switzerland and the
United States, found that village endogamous unions produced more children than
did village exogamous unions, whether in
Switzerland or in the United States (Hulse,
1957). Similarly, Bresler reported that
among New England whites fetal loss increased with the number of countries represented in the great-grandparents’ genera

tion (Bresler, 1970). The results of these
two studies are in the opposite direction to
that of Boas. The Hulse and Bresler
studies suffer most obviously from the fact
that age at marriage is uncontrolled. We
know that those people who marry further
out tend also to marry at a later age. This
fact alone could explain the findings.

In short, while it may be true that a
significant dominance deviation exists for
fertility in some populations, a study with
adequate controls to demonstrate such a
finding has not been done.

The Mindel C. Sheps Award in Mathematical Demography

Nominations are requested for the Mindel C. Sheps Award in Mathematical
Demography, to be presented for the second
time in 1976 and every second year thereafter. The award has been established by
the Mindel C. Sheps Memorial Fund and
is sponsored by the Population Association
of America and the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health. It is
given in recognition of outstanding contributions to mathematical demography or
demographic methodology.

Individuals should be nominated for this
award on the basis of important contributions to knowledge, either in the form of a
single piece of work or a continuing record
of high accomplishment. The award is intended to honor an individual whose future
research achievements are likely to continue a past record of excellence rather than

as a tribute to a demographer who is ending an active professional career. There
are no specific requirements as to age, nationality, or place of residence, nor is the
award restricted to members of the Population Association of America.

The award is named for Mindel C. Sheps
who, at her death in January, 1973, was
Professor of Biostatistics at the University
of North Carolina School of Public Health
and Second Vice-President of the Population Association of America. She enjoyed a
distinguished career as physician, biostatistician, and demographer, applying mathematics and statistics to studies in these
areas.

The recipient of the Mindel C. Sheps
Award will be selected by a committee appointed by the President of the Population
