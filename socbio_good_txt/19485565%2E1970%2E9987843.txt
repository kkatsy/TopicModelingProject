The Probability of Conception after Discontinuance
of Oral Contraception: A Note on ‘‘Oral Contraception, Coital Frequency, and the Time Required To
Conceive,’? by Westoff, Bumpass, and Ryder

Westoff, Bumpass, and Ryder (1969, p.
9) state, ‘‘our considered conclusion [is] that
there is no difference in the time required to
conceive between women who have used
the pill and women who have used other
methods of contraception.” However, the
data on which this conclusion is based invite
a different interpretation. These data are
summarized in Table 4 of the article, reproduced below.

Essentially, the table is an extract of a
life table in which only the probability of
survival without becoming pregnant to the
end of each ordinal month is shown, If we
perform the inversion of determining the
monthly probabilities of conception among
the nonpregnant survivors of the preceding
month, a most intriguing and suggestive
pattern emerges.

Table 1 is a reconstruction of the original
data relating to all pregnancies, first through
fourth, the only column where there are
sufficient pill users for confident analysis.
The monthly probabilities of conception
have been inserted.

Figure 1 illustrates these monthly probabilities for pill-users and users of other
contraceptives

Because of the progressive selecting-out
of women with the highest fecundability, we
expect to find a progressive secular reduction in the proportion becoming pregnant in
each successive month (Sheps, 1965). This is
indeed the case for women who have discontinued other forms of contraception than
the pill. The peak at six months is presumably no more than an example of roundnumber preference. With the pill-users,
however, this normal and well-documented
pattern does not appear. Instead, a marked
bi-modality is present, strongly suggesting
that the use of the pill divides women into
two populations with distinct characteristics. The characteristics of these populations
must be such as to explain the very much
lower conception rate of the pill-users in the
first two months. The authors explain this
difference as being due in part to a higher
rate of accidental pregnancy among users of
less-efficient methods, and partly to lack of

sophistication among users of other methods
in interpreting the question of how long it
takes to become pregnant. Neither of these
explanations, however, accounts for the
finding that pregnancy appears more likely
in the third month than the second, and
more likely in the fourth than the third,
after discontinuance of the pill. It is the
pill-users’ pattern which is abnormal (see
Fig. 1) and unexpected, so that it seems
more likely that some factor is acting to
depress their fecundability than that the
results for other users are distorted.

Social Biology

We have assumed that there are two
populations of pill-users, one of which (approximately 80% of users) is unaffected by
the use of the pill and exhibits the same
probabilities of conception, month by
month, as users of other methods. The other
population experiences a carry-over of the
contraceptive effect of the pill either for
two or for three months after discontinuance (half of the population for two months,
and half for three months).

Table 2 shows the monthly probabilities
of conception deduced from this model and

June, 1961, and September, 1965.
