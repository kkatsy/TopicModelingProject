& ABSTRACT: Published infant mortality rates (IMR’s) for Mexican-American populations fre‘quently are lower than expected given the socioeconomic status (SES) of these populations. It
Ohas been speculated that this is due to bias or incompleteness in Mexican-American vital
e statistics. In this paper an extensive genealogical data base constructed from Catholic church:
Yrecords and civil records for the border city of Laredo, Texas is used to study this problem. The
infant mortality probabilities (IMP’s) since 1950 are compared to conventional IMR’s, both based
strictly on the population at risk defined by baptisms, in which the deaths are a proper subset
Sof the denominator, and these are compared with IMR’s calculated in the usual way from
~ aggregate civil records of births and infant deaths for Laredo. We find that when these data are
ce used, the IMR’s for the most recent years are about twice the conventional rates computed from

"_Yegistered vital statistics.

S
& Infant mortality rates (IMR’s) often
‘Sare considered to be indicators of the
=socioeconomic wellbeing of popula‘Stions. In the United States, risk of inSfant death has always been highest
o among minority and economically dis‘< advantaged populations (Kitagawa and
> Hauser, 1973; Antonovsky and BernSstein, 1977; Stockwell et al., 1978;
NCHS, 1984). This finding has been
$ attributed to such risk factors as inad‘equate pre- and post-natal medical
©care, high parity, inadequate nutrition,
higher incidence of high risk adolescent pregnancies, poor familial support, increased exposure to infectious
diseases— factors which are most prevalent in populations of low socioeconomic status (SES) (see Kitagawa and
Hauser, 1973; Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977, for example). Yet despite
the apparently clear relationship between infant mortality rates and SES,
the infant mortality rates reported for
Mexican-American populations are

puzzlingly low (Teller and Clyburn,
1974; Markides and Hazuda, 1980;
Eberstein and Pol, 1982; Gee et al.,
1976; Selby et al., 1984; Griner-Powell

and Streck, 1982; Palloni, 1978;
Williams et al., 1986).
By most measures, Mexican
American populations are on the low
end of the socioeconomic scale, particularly along the U.S.-Mexico border
(U.S. Census of the Population, 1970,
1980). However, IMR’s in_ these
groups consistently are markedly lower
than those in other populations of similar socioeconomic status and, indeed,
sometimes even lower than those of
U.S. white groups (for example, Markides and Hazuda, 1980; Teller and Clyburn, 1974). It is not surprising, then,
that many investigators treat these
rates with skepticism and either question the validity of official vital statistics for Hispanics (Markides and Hazuda, 1980; Selby et al., 1984; Teller
and Clyburn, 1974), or doubt a contin

ued association between infant mortality and SES (Stockwell et al., 1978), or
suggest that the favorable measures
may be due to “migration selection,”
the possibility that immigrants from
Mexico are healthier than nonmigrants
and so produce healthier infants
(Markides and Hazuda, 1980). Understanding possible biases, and developing better estimates, can have important consequences for health planning
in this group and for our understanding
of the demography of MekxicanAmericans.

Several possible sources of error
have been suggested to explain why
Hispanic IMR’s may be spuriously low,
including the miscoding of race on
birth and/or death records (Rogers,
1989), underreporting of births and
deaths of infants delivered by lay birth
attendants or born to Mexicans illegally in the United States, or overestimation of the number of births to
Mexican-Americans because of the
large number of births in South Texas
to nonresidents, primarily Mexican nationals who travel to the United States
to give birth and return to Mexico
shortly thereafter (Teller and Clyburn,
1974; Selby et al., 1984).

In this paper we report on the infant
mortality experience of a sample of
seven birth cohorts from 1950 to 1977
for the Mexican-American border city
of Laredo, Texas. We believe these figures to be free of these particular
sources of bias because we have not
used birth certificates to determine the
population at risk nor have we relied
on coded ethnicity.

Our source of data is the extensive
genealogies we have reconstructed
from all of the Catholic baptismal and
marriage records and the civil death

records registered in Laredo between
about 1850 and 1977. We also have
civil birth records and aggregate birth
Statistics from 1910 to the present. In
this paper we compare three measures
of infant risk. First, we have computed
infant mortality rates from public vital
statistics records. Second, for the seven
selected years, we have computed the
IMR using total births determined
from baptisms as the denominator and
linked infant death records as the numerator. Finally, we have computed
the infant mortality probability (IMP),
that is, the probability that an infant
born in a year will die before reaching
its first birthday. A comparison of
these different measures of infant
death permits us to estimate the extent
of error in published infant mortality
rates which apparently is due to the use
of recorded births to estimate the population at risk. The IMR’s for Laredo
are also compared with IMR’s for U.S.
whites and U.S. nonwhites for this cen
tury.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SOURCE OF DATA

The city of Laredo lies on the U.S.
border with Mexico along the Rio
Grande in South Texas. Laredo was
part of Mexico until 1846 and has remained predominantly MexicanAmerican (most recently, 90 to 95 per
cent, according to the U.S. censuses of
1970 and 1980) and Catholic, and by
most measures, generally of low socioeconomic status (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1970,
1980). Data for this study are derived
from genealogies we have reconstructed from Catholic Church and

Vol. 38, No. 3-4

civil vital records for the city of
Laredo. We have computerized all
baptismal and marriage records from
the 12 Catholic parishes in Laredo
from the 1850’s through 1977, and all
Laredo death records from the beginning of registration at the end of the
nineteenth century through 1988. The
genealogies have been supplemented
by morbidity data from a sample of
hospital records from admissions occurring between 1910 and 1980.

The construction and genetic analysis of the data base have been described elsewhere (Buchanan et al.,
1982; Buchanan et al., 1984; Norton,
1981; Schwartz et al., 1984; Schwartz
et al., 1985). The data base includes
any Laredoan for whom record of at

least one of six possible vital events was

found: either his or her own baptism,
marriage or death, or the baptism,
marriage or death of a child on which
he or she was listed as parent. For computer record linkage purposes we created a birth record for every individual
for whom we knew date of birth. For
about 98 per cent of the people in the
data base, this information was derived
from the baptismal record, but about 2
per cent of the birth records were created from information on a marriage or
death record. Individual vital histories
were reconstructed by linking birth and
marriage records (and death records, if
deceased) which had matching names
and dates. Individuals were then linked
into nuclear and extended families
when relatives were found, again identified by name and date matching. After matching records were identified by
the computer algorithm, the links were
all verified by hand. Because the primary purpose for which this data base
was constructed was the study of ge
Infant Mortality

235

netic disease, the matching criteria
were very stringent. When necessary,
rather than reconstructing families erroneously, ambiguous matches were
left unmade. The data base includes
about 254,000 individuals and about
83,000 nuclear families.

For several reasons, we have made
no attempt to exclude non-Hispanics
from the data base. First, Laredo is so
ethnically homogeneous that the effort
to identify the approximately 5 per
cent of the population that is nonHispanic would have been too expensive for the small gain. More importantly, identification of Hispanics using
a list of Hispanic surnames, as is sometimes done, would introduce some degree of classification error and ambiguity itself. Therefore, we have done no
classification of ethnicity and assume
that the data base represents a Mexican-American population as cleanly as
could be done with current formulae
for coding Hispanic ethnicity.

STATISTICAL METHODS

The standard method of computing
the infant mortality rate is the number
of deaths to infants less than one year
of age registered in calendar year i, D,,
divided by the number of births registered during the same year, B;:

(1)

(Shryock and Siegel, 1971). For this
study, we have applied this equation in
three different ways. First, we used
registered birth and death records for
Laredo to compute the IMR as in
Equation (1). Second, we computed
IMR’s strictly from the data base using
total baptisms in a given year for B; and
total linked deaths recorded in the

IMR = Bx 10000.

same year for D,. Finally, we computed true cohort IMP’s directly; that
is, where D; is the number of deaths
occutring to the B; baptized infants
(identified individually by record linkage from the death certificates) before
they reach their first birthday (x
1000), whether occurring in year i or
yeari+ 1.

Cohort IMP’s, whether defined on
the basis of all infants born or all infants who die in a given year, are the
most intuitively meaningful measure of
infant risk, but they usually cannot be
constructed éasily. While methods exist to estimate the IMR from the IMP,
there is always some uncertainty in this
approximation due to the rapidly
changing nature of the instantaneous
risk of death during the first year of
post-natal life (e.g., Elandt-Johnson
and Johnson, 1980; Shryock and Siegel, 1971). In this case we have both
measures directly. Although the IMP ts
a more meaningful measure, we include IMR’s for Laredo so that Laredo
rates can be readily compared with
IMR’s from other populations.

Stillbirths are sometimes baptized in
Catholic hospitals, including the hospital in Laredo. To ascertain only liveborn infants, therefore, cause of death
for infants who died on their birthday
was used to determine whether the infant was liveborn or stillborn. The resulting stillbirth rates were 6 to 7 per
thousand per year, which is close to
stillbirth rates reported for other populations (NCHS, 1984). (Removing
these infants from both the numerator
and denominator had the effect of raising the IMP’s by about 0.1 or 0.2 per
1000, so that even complete precision
in this determination would have had
minimal effect.)

RESULTS

INFANT MORTALITY PROBABILITIES
AND RATES

Laredo IMP’s and IMR’s for the period from 1950 through 1977 are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along
with comparable U.S. white and nonwhite IMR’s from 1950 through 1977.

The IMR’s for U.S. whites, nonwhites, and for Laredo are plotted in
Figure 2. In 1950, the IMR in Laredo
was 69.3 per 1,000 live births; by 1977,
the rate had fallen to 25.5, a 63 per cent
decline in 27 years.

IMR’s FROM VITAL STATISTICS
vs. CHURCH RECORDS

Table 1 shows the IMR’s estimated
from registered births and deaths in
Laredo compared to IMR’s calculated
from the data base. For the first half of
this century, it is clear that estimates
from vital statistics are much too high,
presumably because of underreporting
of births in a population in which many
births occurred in private dwellings.
After the 1960’s, however, the number
of registered births is much higher than
the total births for which we have evidence in the baptismal records, and
the IMR’s are quite low. This suggests
that births to transient parents are being recorded in significant numbers.
Compared with the conventional infant mortality rates we have presented
here, the 1970 figure is a 42 per cent
underestimate, and the 1977 figure is a
54 per cent underestimate of infant
mortality in Laredo.

Laredo infant mortality rates constructed from baptisms are very close
to the U.S. nonwhite infant mortality
rates, which, given the generally low
SES of the population of Laredo, is

more in line with what is expected than
are the IMR’s from registered births.

DISCUSSION

This study differs from most studies
of Mexican-American infant mortality
in that we are able, through record
linkage, to follow true cohorts and to
compute the actual probability of
death during infancy rather than to estimate the risk of death as the infant
mortality rate. The critical issue is not
the numerical difference between
these two quantities but the fact that
rates computed from public vital statistics involve numerators that are not
proper subsets of the denominators, as
well as other problems of data uncertainty.

The results of this study suggest that

current Hispanic infant mortality rates
based on vital statistics are indeed bi- .
ased downward, and perhaps increasingly so. The numbers we use here are
not subject to the usual sources of error
that can affect the accuracy of vital
rates for Hispanic populations, including inconsistent classification of ethnicity between births and deaths, overestimation of the population at risk of
infant death due to U.S. registration of
births to residents of Mexico, or underregistration of infants born to Mexicans in the country illegally. It has often been suggested that these problems
bias the IMR’s downward, but the extent of such bias has been difficult to
quantify. Although the use of baptismal records to represent the population at risk may introduce a different
set of problems, discussed below, the

results of this study suggest that IMR’s
for border populations, as they are currently being estimated, may represent
about one-half the true risk of infant
death.

Undoubtedly, the baptismal records
from Laredo do not constitute a complete sample of the population of the
city. Approximately 95 per cent of the
population of Laredo is Hispanic, according to the last two censuses. We
cannot say from direct evidence what
proportion of this population has been
baptized by the Catholic Church. Further, of the 5 per cent of the population
that is not Mexican-American, we do
not know what fraction is Catholic or
has been baptized. However, two independent checks of the data base
against randomly identified individuals
in Laredo showed that the data base

includes about 80 per cent of those currently living in the city, even given recent immigration (and secularization).

We believe that baptisms estimate
the total number of births to Laredoans more accurately than do birth
records because infants born in Laredo
to nonresidents are not likely to be
baptized there and so would not contribute to the population at risk, and
infants born out of hospital probably
are as likely to be baptized as infants
born in hospital. Although there may
have been some emigration of infants
from Laredo, the population has been
growing during this century, and the
fraction emigrating during any single
year would be quite small.

Infant mortality is often used as an
indicator of the general health status of
a population, both by researchers and

by public health policy developers. Accuracy in assessing health service needs
is especially important in the Hispanic
population of the southern tier of U.S.
states, because this population is one
of the poorest in the nation. In most
populations in developed countries,
the number of registered births is a
valid indicator of the number of infants
at risk of death in a defined population.
For Mexican nationals, especially
along the U.S.-Mexico border, however, the possibility of acquiring a U.S.
birth certificate for an infant entices
many women to cross into the United
States to give birth, so that the number
of births registered in the cities on the
U.S. side of the border is much higher
than the number of infants born to residents of those cities.

Thus, researchers and public health

Officials interested in accurate estimates of infant mortality in these areas
must either estimate and subtract the
number of births to Mexican nationals
(using residence information on hospital records, for instance), or find an alternate source for the estimation of the
number of births in the community.
Certainly, it is not always practical to
estimate Hispanic IMR’s or IMP’s
from church records, but it may be possible to use direct computer record
linkage to do so in many areas. Given
the controversy over the accuracy of
Hispanic infant mortality rates, the
rates we offer here may be useful in determining whether more effort should
be expended to correct Hispanic birth
Statistics, particularly for border areas,
and whether rates from vital statistics
are credible enough to use as a basis for
