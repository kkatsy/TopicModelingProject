ABSTRACT: Responses from 6,642 adolescents from forty-six high schools in the United States
were analyzed in a stepwise multiple regression to determine the independent as well as the
combined effects of the variables (family size, birth order, and objective social class of father) on
high-school grade point average. Family size and birth order were not important. Contrary to
other research findings, social class was of some importance. However, additional variables need
to be introduced to explain grade point average.

Considerable interest in the impact of
birth order upon subsequent behavior has
generated a rather substantial body of research literature. In spite of numerous
studies that have attempted to relate birth
order to many dependent variables, the
findings have been inconclusive, sometimes contradictory, and almost always
deficient in theoretical orientation, methodological technique, or both. The overwhelming number of articles treating birth
order have in turn generated several review articles which attempt to summarize
the state of the art. These review articles
generally conclude that first-born are more
affiliative and dependent and have greater
educational attainment, but agree with the
above characterization that birth order
has been inconclusively related to other
variables (Adams, 1972; Sampson, 1965;
Warren, 1966; and Schooler, 1972).

Family size has also been a variable of
considerable interest to many social scientists. This topic particularly reflects concerns for population problems in general.
Although interest has focused on the determinants of family size, there is also a
substantial amount of work which treats

 

family size as an independent variable.
The overwhelming portion of this
literature indicates that large family size
has negative effects on both the children
and the parents. Reviews of the literature
by Lieberman (1970) and Wray (1971,
Chap. 11) identify negative effects of large
families and have been widely circulated.
The literature has been criticized,
however, on several counts, including
faulty interpretation of the data (Thomas,
1972) and lack of socioeconomic control
(Kunz and Peterson, 1972, 1973). Much of
the research does not take social class into
account, and because large families tend
to be from the lower socioeconomic strata,
negative effects attributed to large family
size could well be a consequence of social
class rather than the family size.

A number of recent papers have attempted to relate birth order and family
size while controlling for socioeconomic
status. For example, Belmont and Marolla
(1973) examined almost four hundred
thousand Raven Progressive Matrices
scores (intellectual performance) of 19year-old Dutch men and concluded: “Effects of family size were not present in all

144

Vol. 24, No. 2

social classes, but effects of birth order
were consistent across social class” (p.
1101). Two other papers (Zajonc and
Markus, 1975; Zajonc, 1975) used the
Dutch data and attempted to explain Belmont and Marolla’s findings in terms of a
“pool of intellectual capacity or the total of
each family member’s IQ.” These researchers argued that as birth order and
family size increase, the average IQ, or the
intellectual environment, will decrease
because the IQ of the newborn child is
very low. They conjectured that each
additional child decreases the “pool of intellectual capacity” which increases only
as the child gets older. The researchers
also assume that it would be many years
before the child’s IQ would be equal to the
parents, so as not to cause a general decrease in the pool.

Earlier work by the present authors
(Kunz and Peterson, 1972, 1973) found
that socioeconomic status accounts for
much of the variation in academic
achievement measured by high-school
GPA, ACT scores, and college GPA. The
purpose of this paper is to test the Zajonc
model of birth order and family size while
controlling for social class of the father.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Responses from 6,642 adolescents from
forty-six high schools are reported in this
paper. The sample approximates a cluster
sample in that we attempted to have participating high schools in all major regions
of the United States. However, the sample
is slightly biased in favor of the
Intermountain West; the Northeast is
underrepresented. Students from the tenth
through the twelfth grades are included.

Within each of the high schools the
sample included either the entire population of the high school or all students in
required classes such as mathematics,
English, and health.

Academic Achievement

145

In high schools within the Intermountain West, the research instrument (a
questionnaire) was administered by the
authors, or by one of their assistants. In
other areas of the country, high-school
teachers or other sociologists administered
the questionnaire.

Data regarding the high-school grade
point average, birth order, and family size
for the respondents as well as the objective
social class of fathers were initially considered independently and finally in terms of
multiple regression analysis.

RESULTS

Grade point averages are presented for
family size and birth order separately and
jointly. The effects of social class are also
considered in this section. As Table 1
indicates, there is a variation from 2.65

to 2.49. The highest GPA is associated
with the two-child family, and there is a
decrease in GPA as size of family increases
with the exception of the one-child family
which is lowest of all in GPA. This
correlation between size and GPA without
any control for the effects of class generally supports Zajonc’s explanation.
Examination of birth order shows a
rather different pattern to that of family
size. Table 2 indicates that while there is a
general decrease in GPA as birth order
increases, there are reversals in the case

dicted by the Zajonc model except in the
second, third, and fourth rows where
there is a GPA decrease in each case of
increasing birth order when family size is
held constant. As social class is held constant in Table 4, even that relationship
disappears. This finding argues for the
importance of the social class variable. In
Table 4, there are 25 discrepancies from
Zajonc’s predictive model between the
pairs in each panel. With this type of pattern, one would have to argue that the
Zajonc model is not supported insofar as
grade point average in concerned.
Inasmuch as these tables have only described the relationships, we used a stepwise multiple regression to determine the
independent as well as the combined ef

size, birth order, and the grade point
average reported by the sample of highschool students. Examination of the data
in terms of adjacent pairs shows that there
are nine discrepancies going across the
matrix and 15 discrepancies going down
the matrix. The theory predicts that the
GPA’s should decrease as one moves to the
right and also as one moves down, that is,
as family size and birth order increases.
Thus, in comparisons between the 56
adjacent pairs in the matrix, 23 are not as
predicted.

Generally, there appears to be no pattern emerging in Table 3 like that pre

fects of each of the variables (objective
social class, birth order, and family size)
on high-school GPA. The SPSS computer
program was used to perform the analysis.
The results of this analysis are found in
Table 5. As may be seen in this table,
social class has some importance. Birth
order and family size do not. As may be
observed in Table 5, the equation to predict grade point average is: GPA = 0.18

0.0018 (Family Size) + 3.23. However,

the three partial slope coefficients is zero,

can be assumed to be zero at any level DISCUSSION

of significance no matter how large.
However, the hypothesis that it is zero for
social class can be rejected at virtually any
level of significance. A second indication
of the weak predictive power of birth
order and family size is their small contribution to the multiple correlation
coefficient. Birth order adds 0.003 per cent
and family size adds 0.002 per cent to the
explained variance. Finally, even though
the partial slope for social class is clearly
nonzero, it only accounts for 5.638 per
cent of the variance in grade point,
indicating that additional variables ought
to be introduced.

Our data do not reveal family size and
birth order as relevant predictors of academic grade achievement. The Dutch
data, however, indicate they are very
much related. Reexamination of the matrix in Zajonc’s article indicates 11 discrepancies. From the tables presented by
Belmont and Marolla, in which three class
groups are utilized, 22, 13, and 27 pair
discrepancies respectively out of a possible
72 pairs in each table are identifiable. Perhaps the findings of the above authors are
not supported by their data to the extent
claimed.

In addition, the differences, while gen

minimal, and the apparent elastic graph
technique may overemphasize the differences somewhat.

While there seems to be a rather high
correlation between IQ and GPA, our data
report GPA and their data report IQ. This
difference may account for some of the
differences between the findings. Also, we
must stress that our data are self-reported

obtained. We found no evidence of any
conscious distortions of the data in the
responses. While we are unable to account
for the differences in the findings, we can
conclude that our data do not support the
model. While the model is based on IQ,
our extension of the model to self-reported
academic achievement was not fruitful.
There is no relationship between family

size or birth order and self-reported academic achievement.
