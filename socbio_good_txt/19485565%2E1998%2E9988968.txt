© ABSTRACT: The cumulative onset curves for smoking, drinking, and sexual intercourse have been
Qtracked through adolescence with reasonable success by recursive equations positing an “epiCdemic” or contagious process. The gist of these models is that the likelihood of onset in the next
&time period is proportional to the prevalence of the behavior among an adolescent’s peers in the
occurrent time period. The present paper extends this approach to official delinquency. The fits to
cathe data (from the Philadelphia cohort studies) are extremely tight. Several conceptual mis"matches between the theory underlying the model and the model itself are discussed.

Antisocial behavior is plainly an enSdemic condition. It has been with us at
‘least since ancient Sumer. If attention is
limited to a birth cohort, however, antisoscial behavior takes on the appearance of
‘can epidemic-like condition. Few children
commit adjudicable offenses in the first
Stlecade of life. From close to zero at age
310 the cumulative onset curve rises
Ssharply during middle adolescence and
‘Sthen slows down markedly toward the
cend of the second decade. It is as if an

epidemic were sweeping through the cohort. In the absence of relevant differences among birth cohorts in successive
years, the same onset curve would appear
in datas collected cross-sectionally at one
point in time.

Rowe and Rodgers have taken advantage of this circumstance to develop what
they call Epidemic Modeling of the Onset
of Social Activities (EMOSA) and have
applied EMOSA to smoking, drinking,

1

and sexual behaviors (Rodgers and Rowe,
1993; Rowe et al., 1992; Rowe and
Rodgers, 199la, 1991b; Rowe et al.,
1989). The key feature of the RoweRodgers model is that the increment in
the onset curve from one year to the next
depends on the number of contacts between affected and susceptible but not yet
affected persons. Some of these contacts
are supposed to be “effective,” that is, to
result in onset for the previously unaffected person. A nonsmoker becomes a
smoker, a nondrinker becomes a drinker,
a virgin becomes sexually experienced.
The proportion of effective contacts
among all contacts is called the “transmission parameter.”

EMOSA involves two major assumptions. The first is that the population is homogeneous with respect to effective contacts; effective contacts are supposed to
take place at random between affected and
unaffected persons. Rowe and Rodgers

have sought to make this assumption less
counterfactual in a variety of ways. One
way is to allow for the existence of a nonsusceptible subpopulation. The members
of this subpopulation may have contacts
with affected persons but not effective
contacts. Another way is to carry out separate analyses by race and gender. Still a
third way is to allow for a certain amount
of homogamy. In their analyses of the onset of sexual intercourse, for example, they
have allowed for the possibility that contacts between sexually experienced partners and virgins may be less frequent than
would be expected from their proportions
in the population.

The second major assumption is that
the population remains “intact” over the
study period. Subjects do not move into
or out of the study area from one year to
the next. Rowe and Rodgers have met
this assumption in part by working with
national samples. This solution comes, of
course, at a price. As Rowe and Rodgers
(1991b, p. 213) put it, “the application of
the epidemic model to national data involves an assumption that aggregate, national rates are representative of the
prevalences in typical communities.”

The EMOSA model is tested by finding
out how well it tracks a condition’s cumulative onset curve through adolescence.
The proportion of nonvirgins, for example,
increases regularly through adolescence.
Rowe and Rodgers have shown that their
model can track this function reasonably
well and, therefore, that sexual activity
may be prevalence driven; that is, the more
commonly other persons are sexually active the greater the likelihood that an asyet-inactive person will become active.
The EMOSA model provides an equally
good explanation of the proportion of persons through adolescence who have ever

smoked or ever drunk. It should be noted,
however, that these demonstrations do not
rule out explanations of the same data that
do not involve contagion.

To date, the Rowe-and-Rodgers studies
have dealt with what they describe as
“mildly deviant’ behaviors (sexual activity,
smoking, drinking). To what extent, one
might ask, does the EMOSA model apply
to frankly delinquent behaviors? In addition, most of the Rowe-and-Rodgers studies have been carried out in cross-sectional
samples and, hence, must contend with
secular differences between successive
birth cohorts. Methodologically, it would
be much preferable to study the cumulative
onset curve in a single birth cohort.

This paper reports the application of
the EMOSA model to official delinquency in two large birth cohorts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Philadelphia cohort study is the
largest such study ever carried out in the
United States (Wolfgang et al., 1972).
The subjects were all boys born in
Philadelphia in 1945 who were still there
when they reached their 18th birthday.
The population was, therefore, intact by
construction. As for homogeneity, all subjects were at least resident in the same
city. In addition, allowance will be made
in the analysis for a nonsusceptible subpopulation. The investigators defined
“onset” as a boy’s first official police contact. This contact might be an arrest leading to subsequent juvenile court processing or it might be a police encounter
resulting in informal or “remedial” action
by the arresting officer.

Figure 1 presents the cumulative onset
curve for ages 10 through 17 (Tracy et
al., 1990, Table 10.5). The predicted

curve was obtained by fitting the
EMOSA model to the data, specifically,

who were arrested by age (t+1).

family and neighborhood circumstances,
less than half of the 9,945 boys were susceptible but of those boys who were susceptible most (3,475) were arrested at

author in Pascal.

another person. Examples include homicide, rape, simple and aggravated assault,
and battery. Figure 2 presents the cumulative onset curve for all boys who committed injury offenses (same source as
Figure 1, the column headed “injury offenders”). Again there are eight data
points (years 10-17). These data were fit
using equations (1) and (2) and the same
three parameters as before.

The least squares best estimates appear in Table 1. The transmission parameters are much the same for injury as for
all offenders (0.57 and 0.61). However,
the number of boys who have the potential to commit injury offenses is much
smaller than for all offenses (794 versus
4,101); and the proportion of potential injury offenders whose age at onset is 10 or
less is larger than the corresponding proportion of all offenders (19 per cent versus 9 per cent).

Thirteen years later the Philadelphia
investigators carried out an exact replication of their first study, following up all
boys born in Philadelphia in 1958 (Tracy
et al., 1990). This study was larger than
the first (13,160 instead of 9,945 boys)
and differed markedly from it in a key
respect. Severity of offense was much
greater in the 1958 than in the 1945 cohort. Observed and predicted results for
all offenders are presented in Figure 3
and for injury offenders in Figure 4. The
source for the results is the same as for
Figures 1 and 2. As is clear from the figures, the EMOSA fits are as good as or
better than the fits in Figures 1 and 2.

The proportion of injury to all offenders in the 1958 cohort is higher than in
the 1945 cohort; and the proportion of
potential injury offenders, while larger
than the corresponding proportion of all
offenders, is not as much larger as it was

in the 1945 cohort—perhaps because the
level of severity in general was so much
higher in the 1958 cohort. Both transmission parameters are somewhat higher in
the later than in the earlier cohort.

The curves in Figures 1-4 are all Sshaped. The curves rise slowly at first,
then more rapidly, and finally, toward the
end of the juvenile period slow down
again. Table 2 presents the number of
boys with onset at each age from 10 (or
11) to 17. In all four curves the numbers

are low to begin with and then increase
until at least age 14, after which they decrease for injury offenders. For all offenders, they do not decrease until age 16
or 17.

The slow rate of increase at the beginning of these curves is especially interesting (see Discussion). It is also statistically significant against the hypothesis
that increase is constant over time. The
slow rate initially is least marked for injury offenders in 1945. Nevertheless, if

“Tracy, Wolfgang, and Figlio (1990) reported the number of boys with onset at age 10 in the two samples for all offenders (Table 10 1) For
injury offenders, however, they reported only the number of boys with onset at or before age 10 (Table 10 5)

phenomenon. Anywhere from five to ten
times more males than females are involved in delinquency and crime.”

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Although the fits in all four figures
are very tight, there are several conceptual mismatches that require comment.
EMOSA theory specifies contacts between affected and unaffected persons.
The data, however, concern the proportion of boys to a specified age who have
ever been arrested. This transition involves two mismatches. First, some boys
commit delinquent acts but are not arrested and, second, some boys who were
arrested at one point for such an act no
longer commit them. These two mismatches work in opposite directions. To
the extent that boys commit delinquent
acts but are not arrested, the cumulative
onset curve underestimates the likelihood
that an as-yet-unaffected boy will make
effective contact with an affected one. On
the other hand, to the extent that boys
who were once arrested are no longer
delinquent, the cumulative onset curve
overestimates the likelihood of effective
contact.

It would appear from the results that
these two mismatches cancel each other
out. It would be possible to modify equations (1) and (2) to make allowance for
the possibility that they do not. Doing
so would require at least one more parameter. This parameter, however, could
hardly depart appreciably from null values because the fits are already essentially perfect.

A third conceptual mismatch concerns
contacts with other than agemates. The
model takes explicit account only of
other boys the same age, and effective

contacts may plainly be made with older
or, less frequently, younger boys. The
EMOSA model is counterfactual in this
respect, just as it is counterfactual with
respect to boys who are not arrested or
who were arrested at a younger age but
no longer commit delinquent acts. It
would seem, however, that contacts with
nonagemates are proportionate to contacts with agemates, so that their effect
on onsets is absorbed in the transmission
parameter. It would be possible to modify
equations (1) and (2) to allow for contacts
with nonagemates. In fact, such modified
equations have already been advanced in
the context of sexual behavior (Rowe and
Rodgers, 1994). Again, however, the additional parameters required could not depart appreciably from null values.

The curves in Figures 1-4 merit comment in regard to their shape as well as to
conceptual mismatches. Behavioral contagion has been most often contrasted in
the sociological literature with simple diffusion through a homogeneous population (Coleman, 1964; Cavalli-Sforza and
Feldman, 1981; Burt, 1987). In simple
diffusion a constant proportion of notyet-affected susceptibles become affected
in unit time. More formally,

A,4,=A,+T X(1—A,). (3)
Such a process does not depend on the
number of persons who are already affected. It is not prevalence-driven and,
hence, not contagious.

The temporal course defined by equation (3) is negatively accelerated through
.out. It rises sharply at first and then slows

down gradually. In the late juvenile years
simple diffusion looks very like the
curves defined by equations (1) and (2).
Both curves are decelerating sharply. In

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

the early years, however, the two curves
differ. The rate of increase in simple diffusion is not slow initially; in fact, rate of
increase is steeper initially than at any
later time period. The fact, therefore, that
Figures 1-4 all show an initial slow rate
argues against simple diffusion and for
behavioral contagion.

Unfortunately, this argument is not decisive. If the population is heterogeneous
with respect to susceptibility, rather than
homogeneous, then Figures 1-4 can be
explained without resort to contagion.
Suppose that by virtue of genetic endowment and early experience every boy has
some tendency toward antisocial behavior and, further, that this tendency is distributed very much as in Table 2. For
more than half of the male population the
tendency is so weak that a boy is unlikely
ever to become antisocial. For some others It is stronger but not greatly so; these
boys do not become antisocial until late
in their teenage years, 16 or 17. For most
others the tendency is moderate, with onset tending to be around 14 or 15. For the
remainder it is strong, with onset likely to
be in early adolescence, 10 or 11. Such
an hypothesis can explain the cumulative
onset curves in the Philadelphia cohorts.
Fits as good as those obtained with equations (1) and (2) would require six or
seven parameters instead of just three and
would be, therefore, somewhat arbitrary.
Nevertheless, it remains true that the cumulative onset curves in the Philadelphia
cohorts can be explained by individual

differences in susceptibility to antisocial
behavior as well as by contagion. A decision between the two interpretations
must, therefore, depend on other lines of
evidence. .

Several lines of evidence exist to suggest that boys do not act independently
when committing delinquent acts. Juvenile delinquency is a markedly social activity. Glueck and Glueck (1950) found
that 56 per cent of the 500 delinquents
they studied were gang members, where
a gang was distinguished from other juvenile groupings “by being organized for
a definite antisocial purpose and having a
specific leadership” (p. 64); only 1 per
cent of the Gluecks’ 500 control boys
were gang members. Gang membership,
however, usually has general social effects. It attenuates a boy’s relationships
with parents and prosocial other adults or
peers at the same time that it strengthens
his ties to antisocial persons (EcklandOlson, 1982). Delinquent acts are infrequently committed by a solitary individual. In the usual case the same act is
carried out by two or more boys acting
together (West and Farrington, 1973). A
variety of within-family studies also suggests that when a boy becomes antisocial
the risk to his brothers is increased (Jones
and Jones, 1992, 1994, 1995; Rowe and
Gulley, 1992).

These evidences, while they may not
be conclusive, do support an interpretation of the cumulative onset curves for
male delinquency in terms of contagion.
