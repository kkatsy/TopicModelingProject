Nine Demographic Factors and Their

Relationship to Attitudes Toward

Abortion Legalization

In spite of the appreciable controversy
Over and interest in abortion in the United
States, there has been relatively little research on the factors influencing the attitudes people adopt toward abortion legalization. An early investigation was a 1965
national public opinion poll by the Nationa]
Opinion Research Center in which approximately 1,500 adult Americans were asked
their views on the conditions under which
a woman should be able to obtain a legal
abortion. Approval rates for six conditions
were: if the woman’s health was seriously
endangered by the pregnancy (71%); if
the pregnancy resulted from rape (56%);
if there was a strong chance of deformity
in the baby (55%); if the family had a
very low income and could not afford any
more children (21%); if the woman was
not married and did not want to marry
the man (18%); and if the woman was
married and did not want any more children (15%). The major conclusion was
that there was support among the majority
of Americans for legal] abortion only for the
three “hard” reasons—when the mother’s
health was threatened by the pregnancy,
when the pregnancy resulted from rape, and
when there was a distinct possibility of

43

 

 

deformity in the child. A strong positive
association was found between educational
attainment and favorable attitudes toward
abortion (Rossi, 1966).

Using data from the 1965 National Fertility Study on some 5,600 currently-married women under the age of 55, Moore,
Ryder, and Westoff (1969) conducted an
analysis designed to assess the structure of
American attitudes toward abortion. It was
found that older women who have or hope
they have completed childbearing hold more
favorable attitudes toward abortion legalization than younger women. Jewish women
were least opposed to abortion while Catholic women were most opposed. It was also
found that, except among Catholics (where
the relationship was inverse), education was
directly related to favorable attitudes. Nonwhite women were consistently less favorable than white women in their attitudes
toward abortion.

In 1969, Louis Harris conducted a national public opinion poll using 1,600 respondents. His conclusion with reference to
abortion legalization was that the morality
of the American population is becoming increasingly liberal. This liberal shift characterized those in the upper reaches of

achievement: professional men and women,
the college-educated, the prosperous suburbanites. To these he added the young under
30 and the blacks (Harris, 1969).

Judith Blake, in a recent work on
abortion attitudes, analyzed differences and
changes in views on abortion among Americans during the 1960’s. The data were
drawn from five Gallup polls taken during
the period 1962 through 1969 and from
the 1965 National Fertility Study. Blake’s
conclusion was that abortion for “hard”
reasons is supported most strongly by nonCatholics, males, and the well-educated
(Blake, 1971).

With the exception of the Moore, Ryder,
and Westoff analysis (1969), the aforementioned studies did not attempt a systematic
multivariate analysis of the relationship between demographic variables and attitudes
toward abortion. The present study attempts to correct this deficiency by assessing the relationship of nine demographic
factors—age, city size, education, family
income, occupation of the household head,
race, religion, section of the country, and
sex—to the answers to a question in a
Fall, 1967, Gallup poll for the Population
Council. The question focused on attitudes
toward the legalization of abortion for four
“hard” reasons:

As you know, a few states have recently
enacted laws that make it legal for a
woman to have an abortion if her health
might be endangered, or if the child might
be deformed, or in the case of rape or incest. On the whole do you approve of such
laws or not?

The categories for response were “approve,”
“disapprove,” “don’t know,” and “no answer.””!

1In the sample as a whole, the distribution of
responses was: Approve, 75%; Disapprove. 19%;
Don’t know and No answer, 6%. The present
study, however, uses only the Approve and Disapprove categories.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The 1967 Population Council poll did
not use multivariate analysis—that is, examine the relationship of a given factor to
the opinion question while holding constant
other relevant factors—to assess whether a
particular relationship was real or due to
some other factor. Moreover, only religion
and education of the nine demographic factors on which information was gathered
were examined for their relationship to the
opinion question (Kantner, 1968). The
present analysis was concerned with the
nine background factors on which information exists in the poll and the relationship
of each to the opinion question. The relationship between each factor and the opinion question was assessed via multivariate
analysis (Rosenberg, 1968) in conjunction
with inferential and descriptive statistics.
The inferential statistical test used was chisquare.

To evaluate the strength of a statistically
significant relationship, Cramér’s V was
used.” In tables where significance was established with chi-square but Cramér’s V
was below 0.10, the relationship was considered too weak to be of practical importance. Admittedly, a V of 0.10 is still relatively weak. However, a V of 0.10 helped
divide significant tables containing no apparent response patterns from significant
tables with recognizable response patterns.
It also helped divide significant tables with
small differences between categories of the
independent variable from significant tables

2 2
a —
N Min (7 — 1,¢ — 1)

where Min (r—1, c—1) refers to either the
number of rows minus one or the number of
columns minus one, whichever is smaller. V can
attain a value of 1.00 even when the number of
rows and columns in a table is unequal. A more
detailed discussion of V may be found in Blalock
(1960, p. 230).

Vol. 19, No. 1 Demographic Factors

with more appreciable differences. This criterion was used because the large numbers
involved in the tables often generated statistical significance even though differences
in responses between categories of the independent variable were small and/or exhibited no consistent pattern.

The procedure used in the decision to
reject or not reject the null hypothesis
consisted of three steps. These were determining (1) whether or not tables were
statistically significant, (2) whether or not
significant tables exhibited a V of at least
0.10, and (3) whether or not there was a
consistent pattern to the responses where

_V was at least 0.10.

The basic survey conducted by The Galjup Organization consists of approximately
1,500 interviews. However, following a
standard Gallup procedure to increase the
number of interviews in order to permit
more detailed analyses as well as to enhance
the reliability of a poll’s results, the questions in The Population Council poll were
included in three successive surveys (or
waves), each conducted three to four weeks
apart. However, the results reported in this
analysis were based on just two waves because the opinion question under study was
not asked in one of the three waves.

The number of cases on which the results of the poll are based was the number of individuals interviewed inflated by
a weighting procedure designed to increase
the degree to which the sample is representative of the population.* As a result

3 This is a “times-at-home” weighting and is
used in place of callbacks. The basis for the
weighting is that, in any survey using a single call,
persons who are infrequently at home at the time
of the interview are underrepresented in the sample
while those often at home at the time of the interview are overrepresented. This bias is corrected
by giving greater weight to those persons interviewed who are not frequently at home at the
time of the interview. The weighting is accomplished by counting more than once the responses

 

 

and Abortion Attitudes 45

of the weighting procedure, the number of
cases in the poll is roughly twice as large
as the number of persons interviewed. In
the poll, 4,841 persons were actually interviewed, but the weighting procedure
inflated the number of cases to 9,754.
Dealing with only the two waves in which
the question under analysis was asked, the
inflated number was 6,481. Deleting the
“don’t know” and “no answer” categories,
the inflated number was 6,065. It was on
this number that the analysis was based.

RESULTS

Multivariate analysis indicated that age,
family income, occupation of the household
head, race, section of the country, and sex
did not in themselves have an effect on
attitudes toward the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons. City size,
education, and religion, however, appeared
to have an effect.

CITY SIZE

It was predicted that size of city would
be directly related to the approval of abortion legalization, and a one-tailed chi-square
test revealed that, in the sample as a whole,
such a significant relationship existed, with
V exceeding 0.10 (see Table 1). The hypothesized relationship was supported in the
total sample except for a deviation by persons living in areas of 250,000-999,999
population.

Instituting controls for age, education,
family income, occupation of the household
head, race, religion, and section of the country generated twenty-eight tables; of these,
significance was achieved in all but two.
The tables in which significance was not
achieved were for clerical and sales workers
of interviewees not often at home; the less frequently the interviewee is at home, the greater the
number of times his or her responses are counted,
although the responses of no interviewee are
counted more than four times. This weighting

procedure is in principle equivalent to using four
calls in a Survey.

and for southerners. In all of the significant tables, V was at least 0.10. The significant tables for the relationship between
city size and attitudes exhibited the V
values shown in Table 2. However, in none
of these tables was the hypothesized relationship of a direct, unidirectional relationship between city size and approval found
to exist. Scrutiny of the data revealed only
one general pattern, namely, that approval
of the legalization of abortion for the four
hard reasons was higher for persons living
in cities of at least one million inhabitants
than for persons living in less-populated
areas. This relationship held in all significant tables except for individuals, 30-39
years of age, persons whose family income
was $5,000-$6,999, and residents of the
Midwest.

The research hypothesis that approval of
the legalization of abortion for the four
hard reasons is directly related to city size
was not accepted. However, the null hypothesis that city size bears no intrinsic
relationship to attitudes toward abortion
legalization was also not accepted, since
one general pattern did emerge from the
data. This pattern was that persons living
in cities of over a million inhabitants tend
to be more likely to approve of the legalization of abortion than people living in
areas of lesser population.

EDUCATION
It was predicted that educational level
would be directly related to approval of

 

abortion legalization for the four hard reasons. A one-tailed chi-square test revealed
a significant relationship in the total sample, and V was over 0.10 (see Table 3).

Controls instituted for age, city size,

and sex generated thirty-three tables of
which twenty-eight were significant. Significance was not established in tables for
persons 60-69 years of age, residents of

over, persons with a family income of
$5,000-$6,999, residents of households

the tables for members of households whose
head was a professional or business executive, for members of households whose head
was a skilled worker, and for Catholics.
The twenty-eight significant tables for the
relationship between educational level and
attitudes exhibited the V values shown in
Table 4.

Of the twenty-five tables for which significance was established and for which V
was 0.10 or higher, only four tables clearly
supported the research hypothesis that approval of the legalization of abortion for
the four hard reasons increases unidirectionally with educational attainment. The
four tables were for members of households
whose head was a farmer or farm laborer,

Protestants, Caucasians, and females. Only
in these four tables was approval found to
be directly related to education.

In addition, it was found that an increase in education tends to be associated—
though not in a consistent unidirectional
fashion—with increased approval in several
other tables. In these tables, a direct relationship did not exist between educational
level and approval; however, higher educational levels tended to be characterized
by higher approval rates and lower educational levels by lower approval rates. These
tables were for: persons under 50 or 70+years of age; residents of areas of 10,000—
49,999 population and 250,000-999,999
population; persons with a family income
under $3,000 and at least $10,000; members of households whose head was a professional or business executive (among
whom V = 0.09); residents of the East and
Midwest; and males.

Based on the findings from the multivariate analysis, it was concluded that the
research hypothesis could not be accepted.
However, the null hypothesis that education bears no relationship to attitudes toward abortion legalization was also not accepted. It was concluded that an increase in
education is associated—though not necessarily in a consistently unidirectional fashion—with increased approval for the types
of persons previously specified. It is of
significance that the upper-middle class appears among these categories.

RELIGION

A one-tailed chi-square test revealed that
there was a significant relationship in the
total sample religion and attitudes when
religion was trichotomized into ProtestantCatholic-Jewish; the data appear in Table
5, and V can be seen to exceed 0.10.
Virtually all Jews approved of abortion
legalization; Protestants were less likely to
approve; and Catholics—with a 67% ap

proval rate—were the least likely to approve. Protestant-Catholic differences exhibited a chi-square value of 158.2, which
was significant at the 0.0005 level, and a
V of 0.17. Thus, there was a significant
relationship between religion and attitudes
when religion was dichotomized into Protestant-Catholic as well as when it was trichotomized into Protestant-Catholic-Jewish,
and in both instances V exceeded 0.10.

It had been hypothesized that approval
of the legalization of abortion for the four
hard reasons would be higher among Protestants than Catholics and that Jews would
be more likely to approve of the legalization
of abortion than either Protestants or Catholics. Table 5 leads support to this hypothesis for the sample as a whole. Unfortunately, upon the institution of controls,
Jews had to be dropped from the analysis
due to their small frequency in the sample.

The research hypothesis then was that
approval of the legalization of abortion for
the four hard reasons would be higher
among Protestants than Catholics. Under
controls for age, city size, education, family
income, occupation of the household head,
race, and section of the country, thirtyfour tables were created. Significance was
achieved in all tables except three: for persons living in cities of 10,000-49,999 population, those in families with an income
under $3,000, and Negroes. In the thirtyone significant tables, V was 0.10 or larger

Vol. 19, No. 1 Demographic Factors and Abortion Attitudes

in all but two: for those whose educational
category was “High-school incomplete” and
for members of households whose head was
an unskilled worker. In the remaining twenty-nine significant tables, it was found that
Protestants exhibited a higher rate of approval than did Catholics. The values of
V in the thirty-one significant tables for
the relationship between religious affiliation
and attitudes are shown in Table 6.

An interesting finding was that as educational level, income, and occupational
prestige increased, the relationship between
religion and attitudes toward abortion legalization tended to grow stronger, although
the relationship between religion and attitudes was stronger for farmers and farm
laborers than for any urban occupational
category. It was also found that the Protestant-Catholic differences were not significant when family income was under $3,000
and that they were of no practical consequence among persons in households whose
head was an unskilled worker. This suggests
that no important difference exists between
Protestants and Catholics in the lower
class.

SUMMARY

By way of summary, a multivariate analysis indicated that age, family income, occupation of the household head, race, section of the country, and sex did not have
any general effect on attitudes toward the
legalization of abortion for the four hard
reasons. In terms of population of the area
of residence, persons living in cities of at
least a million inhabitants were more likely
to approve of abortion legalization than
persons in less populated areas. With regard
to the variable of education, an increase in
educational attainment was associated—
though not necessarily in a consistently
unidirectional fashion—with an increased
approval of abortion legalization, particularly in the upper-middle class. With regard

 

49

to religion, Protestants were consistently
more likely than Catholics to favor abortion legalization except in the lower class
and among Negroes (where ProtestantCatholic differences did not exist), and as
education, income, and occupational prestige (for urban occupations) increased, the
relationship between religion and attitudes
tended to become stronger.

Perhaps the most theoretically significant outcome of the present study is that
six of the nine demographic variables did
not have an influence on attitudes and that
the three which did have an influence did
not have a strong impact given the fact V
rarely reached even 0.30. This suggests that
demographic variables possess only a fraction of the predictive-explanatory power
for attitudes toward abortion which has
been imputed to these variables by past

 

Social Biology

research and that a theory to explain and
predict abortion attitudes will not attain
closure until other types of factors, probably including social-psychological variables, are considered.
