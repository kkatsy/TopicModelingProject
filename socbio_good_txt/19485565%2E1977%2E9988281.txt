ABSTRACT: The U.S. fertility rate began a sharp and unexpected decline in 1971. Among the
explanations for this decline are the liberalization of abortion laws and the initiation of major
federal support for family planning services which began several years earlier. Using states as the
unit for correlation analyses, we find no evidence consistent with the notion that subsidized family
planning services contributed to the “birth dearth,” but we identify trends that suggest legal

abortions might have had an effect.

The U.S. fertility rate began an unexpected and precipitous decline in 1971 as
illustrated in Figure 1. Our purpose is to
examine two popular explanations for the
decline: (1) legalization of abortions, and
(2) increased federal subsidy for family
planning services. Both happened several
years in advance of the decline in births.

The first state abortion reform Jaws
were enacted in 1967 (Weinstock et al.,
1975). By 1969 there were nine states that
permitted abortions for reasons other than
preservation of the woman’s life or health,
and an estimated 22,670 legal abortions
were performed. The numbers increased
to 16 states and 193,491 legal abortions in
1970, and 485,816 legal abortions in 1971
(Center for Disease Control, 1974). That
legalized abortion might have contributed
to the “birth dearth,” as this decline has
been called, is suggested by the research of
Sklar and Berkov (1974).

However, at about the same time that
substantial numbers of legal abortions
were first being performed in the United
States, major federal support for family
planning services began. In 1967, Con
gress mandated special emphasis for family planning services as part of the antipoverty program. This mandate was followed by an amendment to the Child
Health Act of 1967, which provided a
substantial increase in federal funds for
family planning services. The increase in
numbers of patients served by organized
family planning programs is reflected by
this change in policy. The number of patients served by subsidized programs for
the years prior to 1968 is unknown, but is
commonly assumed to be negligible. The
number of patients for 1968 has been estimated at 863,000, increasing to 1,070,000
in 1969 and 1,410,000 in 1970 (Corey,
1975). This increase in service might have
contributed to the decline in births.

In the absence of appropriate analyses,
we cannot conclude automatically that
these changes in numbers of legal abortions and subsidized family planning patients contributed to the decline. If many
legal abortions were primarily substitutes
for what would have been illegal abortions, and if contraceptives obtained from
federally subsidized services were substi

tutes for those which would have been
procured through private sources, we
would not expect them to influence trends
in fertility. Moreover, other factors might
have actually caused the decline, such as
increased utilization of private physicians
for contraception or increased illegal
abortions. Data are not available for examining these possibilities. Finally, both
legalized abortions and subsidized family
planning services are utilized by segments
of the population rather than by all those
at risk, and therefore their effects on the
total population could be minimized.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

States and the District of Columbia
constitute the units for analysis. Our strategy was to relate legal abortions to differ
ences in fertility rates for each combination of the years 1967-71 with the hypothesis that states with the greatest number of
abortions would exhibit the greatest declines in fertility. We correlated legal
abortion ratios and fertility rate differences for the years before 1970. If the two
rates were unrelated prior to 1970 but
show a correlation after 1970, it is plausible that birth declines began after legalization of abortion, thus enhancing the
plausibility of our thesis that the decline
might be a consequence of the change in
abortion laws. We repeated this analysis
using subsidized family planning patient
rates rather than legal abortion ratios to
rank states, hypothesizing that states with
the largest number of family planning patients would exhibit the greatest declines
in fertility. Preliminary analyses showed

Vol. 24, No. 3. Abortions and the U.S. “Birth Dearth”

there was no relationship between the
ranks of states on legal abortions and subsidized family’ planning patients. Therefore if each contributed to the “birth
dearth,” they did so independently.

The numbers of legal abortions performed by state of residents in 1970 and
1971 were provided by the surveillance
program of the Center for Disease Control
(1974). These data are unavailable by age
and race for the states. Unpublished
counts of subsidized family planning patients in 1970 by state were provided for
this study by the National Center for
Health Statistics and are available by age
and race. Data on births by age, race, and
legitimacy status were obtained from publications of the National Center for Health
Statistics for the early years (1966-69), and
unpublished tabulations were provided by
the Center for 1970 and 1971. When applying rates, straight line estimates by age
from the 1960 and 1970 U.S. censuses
were used as denominators for intercensal
years.

The 1970 abortion-birth ratios (number
of abortions to residents per 1,000 births)
are used in the analysis presented here.
The ratios for 1970 and 1971, by state,
have been presented elsewhere (Bauman
et al., 1975). The rank order correlation
among states on their 1970 and 1971 abortion ratios and rates were 0.88 or stronger,
and therefore we would not expect results
that differ substantially according to the
year chosen to measure abortions. Indeed,
substituting the 1971 values for those of
1970 when analyzing their relationship
with fertility changes produces patterns
identical to those presented below.

We used family planning patient rates
(number of subsidized family planning
patients per 1,000 women) which were
specific to age and race in order to relate
specific fertility rate differences to age and
race. Legal abortion rates were unavailable by age and race for the states. We
presumed this fineness of data for the

 

185

family planning rates would give subsidized family planning programs an edge
over legal abortions for producing significant associations with fertility rate
trends.

All states and the District of Columbia
were considered when relating legal abortions to changes in total fertility rates. For
the analyses including subsidized family
planning patients, the following five
which did not report this information to
the National Center were excluded:
Alaska, District of Columbia, Louisiana,
Nebraska, and Tennessee. When considering illegitimate fertility only, seventeen
states had to be excluded for the years the
data were unavailable: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Vermont,
Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, New
Mexico, and Oklahoma.

If legal abortions and subsidization of
family planning patients had an influence
upon the “birth dearth,” we would expect
their associations with fertility to be especially strong among the younger age
groups, because most abortions are performed for the young and most subsidized
family planning patients are young. In
1970, 78 per cent of all legal abortions
were performed for women under thirty
(Center for Disease Control, 1970). Eighty
per cent of the patients seeking services
from subsidized family planning programs
were under thirty years of age (Corey,
1974). Thus, if these programs are
influencing fertility, the impact should be
relatively great among the young. We present the data for different age groups and
will give more credence to causal inferences if the relationships are stronger
among young rather than older women.

fertility rates for all combinations of years
from 1967-71, for white women. The correlations for all differences involving 1971
fertility rates are of particular interest
since the decline in births began in 1971.
These correlations are all significant in the
expected directions for the age groups

general, correlations increase between the
years prior to 1970 and the year 1970, as
seen by reading down the columns of

pothesis and also are similar to those of
Sklar and Berkov (1974) who used a different analytical approach. Indeed, our
findings tend to augment those of Sklar
and Berkov who compared trends in fertility rates among states grouped according to several levels of legal abortion
magnitude rather than according to correlation analyses such as those we presented.

Moreover, the conclusion by Sklar and
Berkov that abortion might be causally
related to fertility trends is strengthened
by our finding that the introduction of federally subsidized family planning services
does not appear to be influencing that association.

That family planning patient rates were
not related to differences in fertility rates
might be an indication that our counts of
patients were too crude to rank states accurately according to that variable. However, we find it difficult to imagine that
ranking states on those counts would be
less precise than ranking them according
to legal abortions which did produce associations with differences in fertility.
Moreover, counts of subsidized family
planning patients were available by race
and age, but tallies of abortions crossclassified according to race and age were
unavailable. We presume the family
planning patient rates would have had a
greater chance for showing associations
with fertility rate differences given this
advantage.

It might be posited that since organized
family planning services are oriented toward those unable to afford private services, a relationship between those services and fertility trends is obscured when
ignoring the economic variable. Although
this argument might be valid, as suggested
by the research of Cutright and Jaffe
(1977), the other major study of the relationship between such services and fertility during the period of our study and
among low-income people found no rela

tionship (Udry et al., 1976). Moreover, the
goal of our research was to identify correlates of the “dearth” which appeared when
considering fertility trends for the entire
United States. Finally, some might contend family planning patient rates were
substantially lower than legal abortion
rates and therefore legal abortions but not
family planning services were related to
the decline. In fact, the reverse is true.
Family planning patient rates range from
near zero to 35.5, and abortion rates from
negligible to 24.8. Under no circumstances
were we able to identify associations between subsidized family planning patient
counts and fertility rate differences in the
data we analyzed.

CONCLUSIONS

We found no evidence consistent with
the idea that subsidized family planning
services contributed to the “birth dearth,”
but we found trends which suggest legal
abortions might have produced declines in
fertility.
