Brief Reports

PTC Tasting and Group Membership

Robert Petinga and Edward R. Pierce

Washington, D.C.

In the June 1970 issue of this journal
Turner’s brief report “PTC Tasting in Two
Social Groups” (Social Biology 17:142)
added support to the view that cultural
factors, such as social and racial discrimination, can affect the genetic composition
of human groups by selective membership criteria. A significant difference between a random student sample and that
of a fraternity-sorority sample in taster/
nontaster phenotype ratios was reported
and prompted this study which was undertaken to determine if similar selective
factors are evident in data collected from
a random student sample of state university
students and a random sample of private
university students.

Volunteer students from large introductory survey courses given at a state university and a private university in the
Washington, D.C., metropolitan area were
tested for the ability to taste PTC by the
5% paper impregnation technique. Students
enrolled in these large courses represented
nearly every department on campus and all
geographic and local races, although the
majority were Caucasians. Thus, we felt
these students were representative of the
campus population at their respective universities.

The results of the two sets of tests are
given in Table 1 and indicate no difference

 

TABLE 1
Nontaster Taster Total
Group (#2) (TT,Tt) No.
Random student samples
Private university .. 29.2% 708% 185
State university .... 29.7 70.3 266
Fraternity-sorority
members
Private university .. 15.1 84.9 86

State university .... 28.4 71.6 116

in state versus private university students
in the taster/nontaster phenotype ratios.
The relative frequency of each phenotype
in both samples is more like that of Europeans (c. 25% to 45%) and American
whites (c. 30% to 35%) than like that of
American Negroes (c. 9% to 23%), African
Negroes (c. 6%) or American Indians (less
than 3%). Thus, the selective cultural
factors which are operating are of the same
order of magnitude in the state and private
universities sampled.

At the same time data were collected on
the random student samples we tested,
members of Greek letter fraternities and
sororities were tested in a similar manner
in an attempt to confirm Turner’s work.
The data from these students are given in
Table 1. The random student group and
fraternity group of the state university do
not differ in taster/nontaster phenotype

ratios while the random student group and
the fraternity group of the private university do differ significantly in the taster/
nontaster phenotype ratio, but in the direction opposite that which would indicate
greater selective membership criteria in the

fraternity group. Thus, neither the state
university nor private university comparisons give data consistent with Turner’s
earlier finding of a significantly higher
frequency of nontasters in the fraternity
group than in the random student group.
