ABSTRACT: The five leading causes of death for Navajo males and females are analyzed by life
table methods. Navajo male and female life expectancy at birth were 58.8 and 71.8 years,
respectively. The greatest increase in Navajo male life expectancy would result from the elimination of motor vehicle accidents (5.17 years at birth, and 3.11 years for working ages 15-65). The
life expectancy of Navajo females would be lengthened the most (3.70 years) by elimination of
circulatory system disease. For working-ages gains for both sexes, however, the greatest benefit
would result from elimination of motor vehicle accidents. The implications of the results are
discussed in relation to the various public health programs and health planning efforts for the

Navajo Nation.

The Navajo Nation is an American Indian tribe whose reservation is located in
the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and
Utah. They are the largest tribe, and as
such their mortality experience may be
used to estimate the experience of other
tribes. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the effect of leading causes of death
on Navajo male and female life expec
tancy.
The territory which the Navajo tribe
commands comprises approximately

25,000 square miles or one-fifth of all Indian lands and is comparable in size to the
state of West Virginia. Additional land
under Navajo control includes the Checkerboard area of New Mexico, a patchwork of deeded land in San Juan and
McKinley counties. The Navajo Reservation is situated on the high semiarid
Colorado plateau with an average elevation of 6,000 feet. Much of the land is
inaccessible, except by foot or horseback,
and weather conditions frequently make
unimproved roads impassable. Of the
reservation’s approximately 5,000 miles of

road, only 1,500 are paved (only 40 per
cent as much surfaced road per square
mile as the rest of the Southwest). There is
no public transportation system.

The mortality experience of the Navajos
in modern times is molded in great part by
the actions of the U.S. federal government. Beginning with interactions with
U.S. cavalry and settlers in the early
nineteenth century and continuing with
the Bureau of Indian Affairs into the first
half of this century, the Navajos have not
advanced as far as their nonreservation
counterparts in lengthening life expectancy or lessening the effects of disease.
Significant gains, however, have occurred
since 1955 when the Indian Health Service
took over health care delivery on the
reservation. The crude death rate for all
Indians dropped from 927.2/100,000 in
1955 to 771.7 in 1971 (Indian Health Service, 1974). In many ways the Navajo
Reservation is similar to a developing
country. The population is young (the median age is 17 years) and still in the throes
of the demographic transition to lower

birth and death rates. The per capita income for the reservation is only $805 per
year or one-sixth that of the general U.S.
population. The economy, structured so
long on grazing, can no longer support the
number of persons now living within
reservation boundaries. The per capita income has slipped consistently since 1959,
and the unemployment rate now stands at
45 per cent for those over 16. Landmarks
of the lower health status of the Navajos
include high infant mortality, particularly
past the first month; deaths by accidents
three times those in the United States in
general; alcoholism, a ranking cause of
morbidity and mortality; and trauma, particularly from motor vehicle accidents, a
major health care problem (Kaltenbach,
1976).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The two basic data sources for
constructing abridged life tables for both
Navajo males and females are the registered deaths for the years 1972-74 and the
estimated population figures for 1973.
Death statistics were obtained from the
Office of Program Planning and Statistics,
Indian Health Service (Window Rock,
Arizona). Navajo deaths were tabulated
from the Indian vital statistics tape obtained by the Indian Health Service from
the National Center for Health Statistics.
Tribe of the decedent was identified based
on the decedent’s county of residence.

The population estimates came from the
Statistics Division, Bureau of Indian Affairs (Washington, D.C.), as they were
provided to the U.S. Office of Revenue
Sharing. Census figures for 1970 were not
used because the accuracy of its Indian
count is uncertain (Passel, 1976). These
estimates are based upon certain adjustments made to the 1970 census data, taking into account subsequent birth and

Carr and Lee

Social Biology

death statistics and county migration data
from the Bureau of the Census. Allocation
of population by age was accomplished by
applying the appropriate proportions
found in the 1970 census of the Navajo
Tribe and of Western Indians as a group
(for older age groups 75-79, 80-84, and
85+).

The Navajo death registration may not
be complete. An examination of death certificates in comparison with known deaths
on the Navajo Reservation in 1947
showed that 77.9 per cent of known deaths
had certificates on file Johnston, 1966).
This figure has probably increased considerably from that time due mainly to increasing awareness of vital registration
and partly to an increased number of
deaths occurring in the hospital, reflecting
death taboos that favor bringing the sick
into the hospital to die rather than permitting them to die at home. The most accurate tabulation to date, produced by the
Indian Health Service, was first available
in 1972. Increasing use of the hospital is
also evident in delivery of babies. Now
virtually all registered births among Indians occur in hospitals (Hill and Spector,
1971; Passel, 1976). Although the
completeness of Navajo death registration
is difficult to estimate, we feel that death
statistics are now fairly complete and adequate for our study.

The 1970 census coverage of the Navajo
population has been questioned. An attempt to evaluate the coverage of this
population by the Bureau of the Census
encountered difficulties due to changing
definitions and enumeration procedures.
However, the indication is that Indians as
a group were undercounted in the 1970
census, especially the population under
age 20 (Passel, 1976). A special enumeration in three enumeration districts on the
Navajo Reservation, undertaken jointly
by the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, and the Navajo Na

Vol. 25, No. 4

tion also indicated a significant undercounting. Another source of population
statistics is the continuous Indian Population Register. But this register is not a base
list for administrative records and thus not
an exhaustive listing of all persons utilizing services offered by the tribe or the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (Johnston, 1966).
The population estimates used in this
study are considered to be the most reasonable figures available at this time. This
point is also substantiated by an examination of age/sex pyramids of different
sources of population data. Although both
the death statistics and the population estimate appear to be somewhat underestimated, errors of these two sources tend to
cancel out each other in the computation
of age-specific death rates. Hence, the effect
of data quality on the life table values may
be minimal.

The construction of the regular life tables and the cause-deleted tables was
based on the methodology given by Preston et al. (1972). The regular life table
serves as the basis on which the potential
gain in life expectancy is evaluated when a
certain cause is to be eliminated. A
cause-deleted table is constructed in which
it is assumed that all causes of death are
both mutually exclusive and independent
of each other. The difference in life expectancies between the regular life table and
the cause-deleted table represents the potential gains in the expectation of life by
eliminating a cause of death and, in this
case, will allow us to examine the role of
each cause of death in Navajo mortality.
The potential gain in life expectancy is
examined at birth and also for the normal
working ages of 15 to 65. The gain at birth
reflects the effect of mortality for the entire
life span. The gain for the working ages
will be a more relevant indicator for examining the economic impact of certain
causes of death. The gain for working ages
is computed by the quantity (7,5~-T¢5)/L15

Navajo Tribal Mortality

 

281

in the regular life table from the same
quantity in the cause-deleted table, where
T represents the cumulative stationary
population column in the life table and !
is the number of survivors at the beginning of age interval.

Causes of death were selected for life
table analysis if they were among the five
leading causes of death, excluding senility
and ill-defined causes, for Navajo males
and females in 1974 as defined by Indian
Health Service (1976). The selected causes
for males include motor vehicle accidents
(ICDA E810—E823), circulatory system
disease (ICDA 402-434), all other accidents (ICDA E800—-E807, E825—E849),
respiratory disease (ICDA 466, 740-474,
480-486, 490-493), and cirrhosis of the
liver (ICDA 571). The five leading causes
for females are circulatory system disease,
motor vehicle accidents, malignant neoplasms (ICDA 140-209), infective and
parasitic disease (ICDA 000-136), and
digestive disease (ICDA 531-533, 540543, 550-553, 560, 571, 574, 575).

The accuracy of estimated gains is, of
course, predicated on the accuracy of
reporting by cause of death. Certain
causes (motor vehicle accidents) are more
likely to be completely reported, and
causes of death in the very old and very
young are more likely to be inaccurately
reported. Malignant neoplasms, infective
and parasitic disease, cirrhosis of the liver,
motor vehicle accidents and all other accidents encompass ICDA classifications
identical to those utilized by the National ~
Center for Health Statistics for U.S. life
tables by causes of death (National Center
for Health Statistics, 1975). Ciculatory
system disease encompasses diseases of the
heart, including cerebro-vascular diseases
but excluding rheumatic heart disease.
Respiratory disease encompasses a narrower category (bronchitis, influenza,
pneumonia, emphysema, and asthma)
than that used by NCHS (ICDA 460-519).

RESULTS

The life tables developed for the Navajo
male and female populations showed a
marked difference in life expectancy between the two groups. Male life expectancy at birth and at age one were 58.8
years and 59.6 years, respectively, while
the values for Navajo females were 71.8
years and 72.4 years. Comparison of these
figures with other U.S. population groups
is made in Table 1. Life expectancy for
Navajo males is appreciably lower than
for all other groups at both ages, while
that for Navajo females exceeds all but
that of the U.S. white female at these ages.
This difference is consistent with the
marked male/female difference in mortality rates. The male crude death rate was
7.5 in 1974 compared with the female rate
of 3.6 (Indian Health Service, 1976).

When the entire Navajo population is
considered, the life expectancy (64.9 years
at birth) is not significantly different from
that for all Indians combined, including
Alaska natives, in 1970. This finding
would indicate that the method and basic

Carr and Lee

Social Biology

data used are reasonable to reflect the general consistency, recognizing that the
Navajo, as the largest Indian tribe, contribute significantly to the all-Indian
figure. The minor inconsistency may be
due to the difference in population characteristics. The Navajo population is predominantly rural and is younger than the
all-Indian population which includes a
substantial number of urban Indians. It is,
of course, assumed that significant improvements or decrements in Navajo
health or health care delivery did not
occur in the interim (1970-73).

The median length of life, as derived
from the life tables, shows that the Navajo
male and the U.S. nonwhite male have the
lowest median length of life (62.1 and 66.4
years, respectively), while the Navajo female has a median length of life intermediate between the U.S. white and nonwhite
females. The Navajo male has only a 46
per cent probability of surviving at age 70,
half that of the U.S. white female and
three-fourths that of the U.S. white male.
Similar patterns are reflected in life expectancy figures.

The five leading causes of death selected
for Navajo males were motor vehicle accidents, circulatory disease, all other accidents, respiratory disease, and cirrhosis of
the liver. Motor vehicle accidents and all
other accidents accounted for 19.3 per cent
and 14.2 per cent, respectively, of all male
deaths in 1974. In the United States as a
whole, the five leading causes of death in
1974 were diseases of the heart, malignant
neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, accidents, and influenza/pneumonia. The
importance of motor vehicle accidents is
due in part to environmental factors and
in part to behavioral factors. The low
population density (approximately five
persons per square mile) and great distances to be traveled in daily activities
contribute to an increased use of motor
vehicles. It is not unusual for Navajo
vehicles to have accumulated 30,000 miles
per year. Many of the paved roads are in
poor condition, and the unpaved roads are
dangerous when wet or icy. The life style
of the Navajo male often contributes to
premature deaths due to all other accidents.

Circulatory system diseases, responsible
for 9.7 per cent of all Navajo male deaths,
may be due in part to factors identified as
associated with high risk in the general
U.S. population. Although not included in
this analysis, rheumatic heart disease continues to plague the Navajo population.
Respiratory disease deaths (of which 76
per cent are due to pneumonia) concentrate in the very young (under age 1) and
the very old (65 and over). Death due to
pheumonia can be attributed to delay in
seeking medical care, possibly due to distances to the nearest health facility.
However, death due to pneumonia in
adult males is often alcohol-related. Cirrhosis of the liver is included because of
the important role alcoholism plays in the
mortality and morbidity of the Navajo
male. The effect of alcoholism is only

Navajo Tribal Mortality

283

partly explained by this category; many of
the accidents and other causes are also
alcohol-related. An estimation of the
complete toll due to alcoholism is beyond
the scope of this study. Gains in life expectancy which could be expected from the
elimination of each of these causes are
shown in Table 2.

The greatest gain in life expectancy that
would be seen by Navajo males at birth
(5.17 years) would be from the elimination
of motor vehicle accidents, followed by the
elimination of circulatory system disease
(3.31 years). Elimination of all other accidents would add 3.13 years to the Navajo
male infant’s life. Elimination of respiratory disease and cirrhosis of the liver would
add 1.48 and 0.97 years, respectively.
Navajo males’ mortality and subsequent
life expectancy is heavily influenced by accidental deaths. For added years of life for
working ages (15-65), the gains to be accrued by elimination of causes of death
follow this ranking: motor vehicle accidents, all other accidents, circulatory system disease, cirrhosis of the liver, respiratory disease. A preponderance of
deaths from motor vehicle accidents, all
other accidents, and cirrhosis of the liver
in youngest ages influences the distribution of working-ages gains for Navajo
males.

The leading causes of death (excluding
senility and ill-defined causes) for the
Navajo female in 1974 were: circulatory
system disease, motor vehicle accidents,
malignant neoplasms, infective and
parasitic disease, and digestive system disease. Factors which influenced male mortality from the first two causes also affect
female mortality from these causes. Cancers and circulatory system disease reflect
the general disease pattern of the majority
of the U.S. population. Delay in seeking
medical care may also contribute to female
mortality due to infective-parasitic and
digestive disease. Navajo females overall,

however, present a better mortality picture than their male counterparts. Gains
in life expectancy which could be accrued
by elimination of each of these causes of
death are shown in Table 3.

The largest gains in life expectancy at
birth would be achieved by elimination of
circulatory system disease (3.70 years) and
motor vehicle accidents (2.70 years). For
elimination of motor vehicle accidents, the
benefit to be assumed by the female is
about one-half that of the male, while for
circulatory system disease they are almost
equal. Eliminating cancer as a cause of
death would add 2.20 years to a Navajo
infant female’s life, while elimination of
infective-parasitic and digestive disease
would each add about 1.50 years. In terms
of adding years for working ages (15-65),
elimination of motor vehicle accidents
would have the greatest effect (1.14 years)
on the Navajo female. This effect is due to
the concentration of these deaths at age

15-45. As far as the working life is concerned, the motor vehicle accident plays
the most important role for both Navajo
males and females.

Comparison of these gains with those of
other populations can serve to illuminate
the unusual mortality of the Navajos.
Elimination of motor vehicle accidents for
U.S. white males and females in 1969-71
would only add 0.93 and 0.41 years at
birth, respectively (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1965). The greatest benefit for U.S. whites (male and female)
would result from the elimination of the
major cardiovascular diseases (10.46 and
11.98 years, respectively). The same patterns are observed in Finland in 1970
where 7.7 years for males and 6.5 years for
females could be anticipated from the
elimination of vascular diseases. Only 0.72
and 0.35 years at birth, respectively, could
be expected from the elimination of motor
vehicle accidents in Finland (Hemminki et

not present a mortality and survivorship
picture typical of the modernized Western
world.

DISCUSSION

The Navajo population presents an age
structure and mortality experience markedly different from that of the remainder
of the U.S. population, resembling in
many ways that of a developing country.
Most striking among the evidence
presented here was the difference in male
and female mortality and the resultant effect upon survivorship. Navajo male life
expectancy is approximately that of the
white male in 1928-31 (National Center
for Health Statistics, 1976) which represents a lag of 45 years. The Navajo female
is experiencing a life expectancy similar to
that of the white female of 25 years ago

(1949-51). Contributing significantly to
the lowered life expectancy for both males
and females are motor vehicle accidents,
especially for working ages, and cardiovascular disease. The crude death rate
from motor vehicle accidents rose from
50.3 (per 100,000) in 1966-67 (Brown et
al., 1970) to 115.8 in 1974 (Indian Health
Service, 1976). Intervention strategies
aimed at reducing mortality due to auto
accidents should include: a mass media
campaign on the hazards of speed and
driving while intoxicated; a reservationwide automobile safety inspection program (the state of Arizona has such a program but not on the reservation); improvement of the emergency medical system; and various health and safety education programs.

Auto accidents and alcoholism are examples of manifestations that are primarily behaviorally related. Certainly the

prevalence of alcohol-related deaths reflects a need for alcoholism programs.
Paradoxically, the effects of alcoholism
and alcohol abuse may be addressed by
legislation of alcohol on the reservation.
The high proportion of alcohol-related
deaths and alcoholism indicates that prohibition has had little or no beneficial effect on morbidity or mortality. Previous
studies on other reservations have shown
that once use of alcohol can be socially
accepted and managed, alcohol abuse will
drop (May, 1976). Certainly, alcohol
legalization can affect arrests, which can
be viewed as indicative of social ills (May,
1975). An added incentive is the tax revenue which the tribe could receive and use
to fund alcoholism and behavioral health
programs.

The infective and parasitic diseases still
play an important role in Navajo female
mortality. Although this category of
diseases does not appear in the five leading
causes for Navajo males, it 1s still playing
an important role (seventh leading cause).
Contributing factors to this category of
diseases may include sanitation (perhaps
the single most important factor relating to
infectious disease), poor housing, malnutrition, and behavior. The coupling of poor
overcrowded housing with a lack of sanitation facilities, running water, and electricity plays a dominant role in the prevalence of environmentally related disease.
Malnutrition exacerbates conditions not
normally fatal in the U.S. general population. Over a four-year period (1972-75),
46 per cent of all malnutrition cases diagnosed were in the 0—4 age group, which
also experienced a high infectious disease
mortality rate (Kaltenbach, 1976).

Existence of the U.S. circulatory system
disease pattern is primarily due to lack of
awareness of currently recognized risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diet) and
could be affected by proper health education and screening procedures. Prevention

of rheumatic heart disease by streptococcal disease surveillance is presently being
attempted by the Tribal Streptococcal
Disease Control Program. Mortality due
to all other accidents could be reduced by
providing quicker emergency services, although the shift of the male population
from isolated rural occupations to concentrated “urban” ones should have a beneficial effect. Cancer mortality could be
reduced by increasing public awareness of
the importance of early diagnosis and
treatment, of the signs and symptoms of
cancer, and by the provision of detection,
treatment, and follow-up services. The
need most common to the majority of
these intervention approaches is an extended health education program. Difficulties which must be overcome in the provision of health education to this population are that many persons do not read
English or Navajo (until recently only a
spoken language) and a significant number
do not speak more than a few words of
basic English.

In health planning, it is important to
consider the effect of population age composition and its interrelationship with
mortality because funds available for intervention are limited. Consideration of
the differing effects of causes of death on
measures of survivorship can provide additional information in the planning of and
the assigning of priorities to health services. The study has shown that data of
uncertain accuracy can provide valuable
information on the mortality experience of
a population if used with reference to
previous studies and only until reliable
data is available.
