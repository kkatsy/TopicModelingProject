Factors in the Incidence of Childlessness

in Canada: An Analysis of
Census Data

J. E. Veevers

Department of Sociology

London, Ontario

The research available concerning the
phenomenon of childlessness is very limited,
especially when compared with the voluminous literature which has been directed
toward other facets of human reproduction.
When the occurrence of childlessness is considered, a variable assumed to be of primary importance is the issue of causation.
In discussing the causes of infertility, it is
traditional to distinguish at the onset between “voluntary” and “involuntary”
childlessness (Pohlman, 1970). This dichotomy implicitly assumes an incongruence between child-bearing motivation and
child-bearing capacity. Voluntarily childless
couples are assumed to be fertile, but not
inclined towards parenthood; involuntarily
childless couples are assumed to want children, but to be unable to have them.

Although the theoretical implications of
the distinction between voluntary and involuntary childlessness are manifold, the
practical application of the dichotomy is
very difficult. In order to place individuals
in the appropriate category, it is necessary
to know details concerning not only their
health, but also their innermost motivations
and aspirations. Such data can be gleaned

 

only in intensive personal interviews and
are not readily available for representative
samples of large populations. As a result, it is not surprising that research
directly concerned with assessing voluntary
and involuntary motivations for childlessness is rare (Popenoe, 1936; Kiser, 1939;
Popenoe, 1943; Whelpton and Kiser,
1950). Most of the data on childlessness
are collected incidentally during research
overtly concerned with other themes.
Some information is available from
census materials which can provide reliable
factual information concerning the sociodemographic characteristics of women who
do not become mothers (Harrington, unpublished). However, such materials do
not provide any direct information regarding causation. Thus, although Grabill and
Glick (1959, p. 60) acknowledge that
“data on voluntary or involuntary childJessness are . . . one aspect of comprehensive demographic investigations,” their own
analysis of American census data makes no
attempt to unravel the causes of childlessness. Information concerning childlessness
is also available incidentally in the largescale American fertility studies, based on

266

interviews with representative samples of
American women (Whelpton and Kiser,
1950; Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell,
1959; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson,
1966). Although the samples involved are
large and carefully drawn, they do not
compare in size or comprehensiveness with
samples from the census itself.

The dilemma involved in a perfectly
comprehensive description of childlessness
lies in the desire on the one hand to utilize
very large and comprehensive samples such
as are available through the use of census
materials, and the need on the other hand
to involve respondents in detailed and expensive personal interviews in order to
establish adequately whether a particular
incident of childlessness is voluntary or
involuntary. It is suggested that although
the latter kind of information is undoubtedly invaluable for the clinical assessment and counselling of individual couples,
it may be superfluous for purposes of demographic analysis. From the demographers
viewpoint, it is suggested that a more
heuristic approach to the problem may be
to differentiate childlessness not in terms
of intentional-unintentional, but in terms
of childlessness which is due mainly to
physiological factors, and _ childlessness
which is due mainly to psychological
factors. It is the contention of the present
research that if such a change in orientation
is made, it becomes possible to utilize
census data to estimate the relative importance of physiological and psychological
factors in the etiology of childlessness. The
problem of the present research is to apply
this perspective to the analysis of data from
a 20% sample of the 1961 Canadian census?

1The 1961 Dominion Bureau of Statistics
Census of Canada includes a 20% sample on
Migration, Fertility, and Income, which provides
information on the number of children who have
ever been born to over four million Canadian
women who have ever been married. These data
are subject to at least two limitations. First, be

and to thereby estimate the incidence of
psychological childlessness among urban
Canadian women.

PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
CHILDLESSNESS

The many possible causes of childlessness can be usefully classified into two main
groups: physiological factors and psychological factors. Physiological factors are
those which contribute to some specific
physical abnormality or malfunction of the
reproductive organs and so lead to the
sterility of the husband and/or wife. Such
damage may result from congenital defects,
traumatic injuries, disruptive diseases
(such as venereal diseases or mumps), impairment of the reproductive process during
surgical procedure, or a variety of other
circumstances. Estimates of the incidence
of sterility vary, depending upon the operational definitions used,? but it is generally
felt that about 10% of all couples are
definitely sterile. For example, Thomlinson
(1965, p. 48) states: “About one-third of
all couples in the United States appear to
be subfecund, and approximately ten per
cent are definitely sterile, that is, they seem

cause statistics refer only to the parity of wives,
only very cautious generalizations can be made
concerning childless husbands or childless couples.
Second, no information is available on marital
history. Presumably, some of the childlessness
among ever-married women can be attributed to
the absence of the husband for some or all of the
fecund years, due to separation, desertion, divorce,
or death.

2The idea of sterility has been used in a
number of ways in demographic literature. At
least two dimensions are commonly involved. In
terms of duration, sterility may refer to a lifetime inability to have children or, at a particular
time in life, the inability to have any more children. In terms of degree, sterility may refer to
being absolutely sterile, with no possibility of
having children; to being probably sterile, with
little chance of having children; or to being subfecund, with a below average probability of
having children. For the purposes of the
present research, sterility will be used to refer to
those situations where it is certain or almost
certain that a woman has never had a child and
will never be able to have one.

268

totally incapable of having children.” He
later extends this estimate to refer also to
Canada as a whole (1965, p. 157) Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson (1966, p.
163) conclude: “If fecundity impairments
had been the sole cause of childlessness,
the proportion of couples with no children
would have been between nine and thirteen
percent.”

Psychological factors are those which
lead to the infertility of the husband and/
or wife, although there are no apparent
physical reasons why reproduction does not
occur. Psychological factors may be manifest in two different but related ways, as
psychosomatic infertility, or as voluntary
childlessness. The processes involved in
psychosomatic infertility are not clearly
understood, but for at least some people
psychic strain, tension, or the intense desire
to avoid parenthood, apparently can interfer with the reproductive process. No
estimates are available of the probable incidence of psychosomatic infertility. Voluntary childlessness involves the absence of
children due to the deliberate decision by
the husband and/or wife not to have any
children, and to use birth control and/or
induced abortion to prevent any live births.

In practical terms, it is very difficult to
separate psychosomatic infertility from
voluntary childlessness, and the attempt to
do so lends itself readily to a variety of
speculations. For example, the same socialpsychological factors which contribute to
voluntary childlessness may very well contribute to psychosomatic infertility as well,
rendering elaborate birth control measures
superfluous. Some women who claim they
want to conceive may be unconsciously rejecting pregnancy and motherhood, and
those unconscious processes may affect
their fecundity. In Kiser’s study of 300
never-pregnant women, about 15% of those
who sought medical help in becoming pregnant were told there was “no apparent

Veevers

Social Biology

reason” why they did not conceive (Kiser,
1939).

Although early studies suggested that of
all childless couples, between one-half and
one-third were childless by choice (Popenoe,
1936; Kiser, 1939; Popenoe, 1943; Whelpton and Kiser, 1950), recent data suggest
that almost all childlessness is due to
sterility. Kiser hypothesizes that the lower
the incidence of childlessness in a population, the lower the proportion of all childlessness which is deliberate (Kiser, 1959).
In the opinion of many population and
family life experts, as the rates of childlessness have declined, voluntary childlessness has virtually disappeared. For example,
Thomlinson (1965, p. 148) concludes:
“Almost all couples who say that they expect to be childless are biologically subfecund; voluntary childlessness is very
rare in the United States today.” Martinson (1970, p. 314) reflects a ubiquitous
opinion among scholars when he states
flatly: “The desire for children is nearly
universal. Marriages childless by choice are
practically nonexistent.” Bell (1971, p.
417) comments: “High positive values
about having children are accepted by the
vast majority of Americans, and the
majority of childless couples are not that
way by choice.” Williamson (1966, p. 430)
notes that although women may vary in the
number of children they prefer: “In reality,
few women reject the idea of children altogether.”

ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM INCIDENCE
OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CHILDLESSNESS

In a population with very high positive
values on fertility, it can be assumed that
almost all of the childlessness which occurs
will be due to physiological factors. It is
suggested that the minimum rates of childlessness in a high fertility population provide a useful estimate of the maximum
possible rates of physiological childlessness

Vol. 19, No. 3

in a comparable population. When the
maximum possible rates of physiological
childlessness are compared with the actual
rates of childlessness observed, the difference may be attributed to psychological
factors, either psychosomatic sterility or
voluntary childlessness.

Although this procedure has never been
systematically applied to the description of
childlessness in populations, several authors
have employed a similar line of reasoning in
formulating their conclusions. For example,
Mitra (1966, pp. 134-135) argues as
follows: ‘No more than 3.9% of whites...
are biologically incapable of having children. Of white women aged 45 to 49...
22.1% were reported childless ... . If sterility can explain no more than 3.9% of
the cases, then the remaining 18.2% women
must be those who decided to remain
childless.” Bogue (1969, p. 726) concludes:
“When childlessness rises above 10 percent
in couples, we may infer that it is either
primarily voluntary childlessness or else.a
result of very irregular exposure to childbearing.’”®

In estimating the relative importance of
physiological and psychological factors in
childlessness in urban Canada, the minimum rates of childlessness among women
in rural farm Quebec can be used as estimates of the maximum possible rates of
physiological childlessness. This procedure
is predicated upon the following assumptions.

Assumption One: Physiological Sterility.
It is assumed that the incidence of physiological sterility will be essentially similar
in rural and urban areas. Although a number of conflicting theories have been advanced concerning this question, there is

3In view of the fact that he concludes earlier
that “one couple in 20 is sterile at the time of
marriage or else will go through its marriage
childless for physiological reasons” (Bogue, 1969,
p. 725), one wonders why he does not consider
5% to be the appiopriate basis for comparison.

no conclusive evidence that the physiological characteristics of rural and urban
populations are essentially different.

Generally speaking, rural populations
have a lower socio-economic status than
urban populations. If any difference in
fecundity exists between the two groups, it
might be expected that urban residents
would be somewhat more fecund. There is
some reason to believe that overall poor
health may be associated with subfecundity.
Womble (1966, p. 383) states, “Lowered
vitality . . . defective nutrition, overfatigue

. infection, vitamin deficiency, and defective metabolism may all contribute to
infertility.” Urban populations may have
generally better health, with greater access
to better medical facilities. Freedman,
Whelpton and Campbell (1959, p. 18)
conclude: “‘Low-status groups... are more
likely than high-status groups to be classified as subfecund, but it is unlikely that
this is due to basic biological differences.”

Assumption Two: Psychosomatic Infertility. It is assumed that whatever the
etiology of psychosomatic infertility, its
incidence can be expected to be minimal
in rural farm areas compared with urban
areas.

Assumption Three: Voluntary Childlessness. It is assumed that, given the fertility
motivation among women in rural farm
Quebec, and their proficiency at fertility
control, voluntary childlessness in this
population will be virtually nonexistent.

Rural farm women generally desire larger
families than do urban women, and have
a less positive attitude towards the use of
birth control and abortion. In addition,
96% of women in rural-farm Quebec are
Roman Catholic, compared with only 46%
of women in urban Canada. This is assumed to affect the incidence of voluntary
childlessness at least two ways. First,
Catholics generally desire more children
than non-Catholics. Given the Church’s

270

teaching that an intentionally childless
marriage is not valid in the sight of God,
it is unlikely that a Catholic wife would
consider childlessness an ideal state (Pohlman, 1970, p. 7). Second, the Catholic
taboos on birth control and abortion are
stricter than non-Catholic restrictions. Even
in the improbable event that a rural Catholic wife would prefer to avoid motherhood,
her ability to successfully control all of her
own fertility is exceedingly doubtful.

As would be expected, the rates of childlessness among rural farm women in Quebec
do prove to be remarkably low.‘ Since age
at first marriage is known to affect the
incidence of childlessness (Veevers, 1971)
and since women in rural Quebec do tend
to marry younger than their urban counterparts,> the minimum rates of childlessness
were calculated controlling for age at first
marriage. Since, even in Quebec, the rates
of childlessness do vary slightly over time,
it is possible that some of the childlessness
is due to psychological factors. However,
what is important for the present purposes
is that the rate of physiological sterility
could not be more than the entire rate of
childlessness, and as such the rates for rural
farm Quebec can be taken as maximum
estimates of physiological childlessness.

4The rates of childlessness among women in
rural farm Quebec are comparable to the lowest
reported in the literature. For example, Grabill
and Glick report that the most extreme case they
could find in a survey of the American census for
1910, 1940, 1950, and 1957 was for women over
40 years of age in 1910 who were born in Russia
and Poland. Among this group, the lowest rate
was 2.3%, and the average was about 3% of aged
women ever married. The lowest reported rate
for women born in North America was found
among women in Utah who were from 50 to 74
years of age in 1910, of whom only 4.5% were
childless (Grabill and Glick 1959, pp. 62-63).

5In urban Canada, the distribution of age at
first marriage is as follows: 26.6% are married
from 15 to 19; 46.5% from 20 to 24; 17.7% from
25 to 29; 5.3% from 30 to 34; and 3.9% at 35 or
older. In comparison, women in rural farm Quebec
tend to marry younger. There, 29.0% are married
from 15 to 19; 49.5% from 20 to 24; 16.2% from
25 to 29; 4.7% from 30 to 34; and only 0.7%
at age 35 or older.

Social Biology

These rates are given in Column 4 of Tables
1 and 2.

Another group ideally suited for this
kind of comparison are Hutterite women.
The Hutterite way of life combines a rural
background and a desire for large families
with early marriage and absolutely no birth
control or abortion. One could discount completely the possibility of voluntary childlessness and could expect that psychosomatic sterility would be rare. It has been
estimated that among Hutterite women
ever-married, the incidence of childlessness
is less than 3% (Whelpton, Campbell, and
Patterson, 1966, p. 164).

ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM INCIDENCE
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CHILDLESSNESS

To estimate the extent of psychological
childlessness among urban Canadian women
past childbearing years, the following steps
were taken, as shown in Table 1 and 2.

1. For each age at first marriage, the number of urban women (Column 2) and
the percentage of urban women who remain childless (Column 3) was calculated from census data

2. For each age at first marriage, the lowest recorded percentages of childlessness
among rural farm women in Quebec
were selected as indicating the maximum
percentage of childlessness due to physiological reasons (Column 4).

3. These percentages were applied to the
number of urban women to obtain an
estimate of the number of urban women childless due to physiological
reasons (Column 5).

4. The minimum percentage of childlessness due to psychological reasons was
obtained by subtracting the percentage
due to physiological reasons from the
percentage of all childlessness (Column
6

5. These percentages were applied to the
number of urban women to obtain an
estimate of the number of urban women
childless due to psychological reasons
(Column 7).

6. The estimates of number of urban women childless due to physiological reasons were compared with the estimates
of the number of women childless due to

psychological reasons to obtain an index of the relative importance of the
two factors (Column 8).

CONCLUSIONS

An examination of the child-bearing patterns of Canadian women indicates that,
as the general incidence of childlessness
has declined (from 15.2% for women over
45 to only 10.8% for women aged 30 to
44), the estimated incidence of physiological childlessness has declined as well,
from 6.6% to 4.6%. Since some of the
younger women may still bear at least one
child before the onset of the menopause,
this incidence may actually decline still
further.6 Among the factors which have
probably been influential in effecting this
change are the declining age at first marriage, the general improvement in the treatment of subfecundity problems, and the
overall improvement in health standards.

The incidence of sterility in the population is often estimated at about 10% of all
couples. The data presented suggest that
this figure is much too high and that a
more realistic estimate would be about 5%
or less. Although similar low estimates
have been previously mentioned in the

6 Although it is theoretically possible for a
nullipara over the age of 30 to bear a child, it is
very unlikely. For example, the rate of first births
of women aged 30-34 is 6.6 per 1000, compared
with 75.3 per 1000 for women aged 20-24. By the
age 35-39, the rate has dropped to 2.2 per 1000,
and by the ages 40-44 it almost disappears at only
0.5 (Natality Statistics Analysis, 1970, p. 13).

literature (Kuczynski, 1938, p. 359;
Mitra, 1966, p. 134; Bogue, 1969, p. 725),
the discrepancy between them and the
common assertion of 10% has engendered
little comment.

The incidence of voluntary childlessness
also appears to be declining, in spite of the
many common sense arguments as to why
it might be expected to increase. Among
post-menopausal women, an estimated 8.6%
of those ever-married did not become
mothers as a result of psychological factors;
among younger women ages 30 to 44, the
comparable percentage is estimated to be
only about 6.2%. However, contrary to
Kiser’s hypothesis (1959, p. 4928) the relative incidence of the causes of childlessness
has not substantially changed. Although
childlessness has declined, the estimated
proportion of childlessness due to psychological factors has remained relatively
constant at slightly more than 50% (Col.
8, Tables 1 and 2). Given the fact that
psychological childlessness apparently accounts for at least half of the childlessness
of ever-married women over the age of 30,
it seems premature to presume, as Tomasson (1966, p. 328) and others have, that
a “virtual disappearance of deliberate
childlessness” has already occurred.
