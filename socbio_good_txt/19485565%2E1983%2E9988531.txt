‘2 ABSTRACT: Male and female students were asked to select from photographs projected on slides

quencies of contrasting hair color, facial expression, and profile types were varied on the slides
to determine whether a minority-type advantage occurred. It was found that minority-type fe© males were selected more frequently than expected on slides contrasting hair color and facial
© expressions, and that minority-type males were selected more frequently than expected on
slides contrasting facial expression. The increased selection of the minority females was appar
S ently due to constant bias, whereas the increased selection of the minority males was apparently
& due to both constant bias and frequency-dependent bias.

In almost all studies showing a

Solikelihood that a particular type of indi§ vidual is selected as a mate is inversely
= related to the frequency of the type in
S the population. Since rarity increases
+= the likelihood of mating success and
© therefore would tend to improve the

= implicated as an important means of
2 maintaining genetic variability within
& populations (Ehrman and Probber,
= 1978). It has also been implicated as an
& important means of increasing the degree of outbreeding in populations (Lewontin, 1974).

The minority type mating advantage
has been extensively investigated in laboratory populations of Drosophila (for a
review see Ehrman and Parsons, 1981).
A rare male frequency-dependent advantage has been reported to occur between strains of Drosophila having different karyotypes (Ehrman, 1967;
Spiess, 1968; Spiess and Spiess, 1969),

between strains differing at a single or
limited number of loci affecting somatic
traits (Petit, 1959; Ehrman, 1970; Spiess
and Kruckeberg, 1980), between strains
carrying different allozymes (Ehrman et
al., 1977), between strains of different
geographical origin (Ehrman and Petit,
1968; Ehrman, 1972), and between genetically identical strains raised at different temperatures (Ehrman, 1966;
Spiess, 1970) or raised on different medias (Dal Molin, 1979). The mating advantage of minority males has also been
shown in laboratory populations of the
red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum
(Sinnock, 1970), the parasitic wasp
Mormoniella vitripennis (Grant et al.,
1974), and the guppy Poecilia reticulata
(Farr, 1977).

There is little or no evidence of a minority type frequency-dependent mating advantage in humans (Neel and
Schull, 1969). Although Woolf and Dukepoo (1969) suggested that a form of
cultural selection (in which albino males
have a sexual advantage over the more

common nonalbino males) is the most
apparent explanation for the high frequency of the albino gene they observed
in the Hopi Indians, the sexual advantage of the albino males seemingly is related more to their increased availability
than their rarity. For while nonalbino
males spent much of their time in the
past toiling in the fields, the albinos
spent their time in the village with the females and were thereby more available
for sexual activity.

The present study is an attempt to determine whether a basis for a minority
type mating advantage might exist in human populations. Since a rare type mating advantage seems to be pronounced
in organisms with elaborate courtships
(Childress and McDonald, 1973), and
since a high degree of mate selectivity
would seem to be of particular evolutionary value in organisms where parental investment in the progeny is extensive, it is reasonable to expect that the
minority type mating advantage might
occur in humans. Furthermore, since
the human male and female both makea
major contribution to the rearing of
their offspring, it is reasonable to expect
that both male and female minority type
selection may occur.

In the present study, male and female
participants were asked to select from
photographs displayed on slides the individuals they would most prefer as
mates in a long-term husband-wife relationship. Frequencies of contrasting
characteristics including light and dark
hair color, smiling and nonsmiling facial
expression, and left and right profiles
were varied in sets of slides to determine
whether a minority type advantage exists. An attempt was also made to identify factors contributing to a minority
type advantage when it was found.

Human Mate Preferences

MATERIALS AND METHODS

College students from sixty sections
of an introductory biology class were
shown a collection of slides, each of
which displayed from 6 to 12 colored
graduation photographs of high school
seniors. The students were asked to select the photograph of the individual
they would most prefer as a mate in a
long-term husband-wife relationship.
Male students participating in the study
were asked to select an individual from
each of eight slides displaying photographs of females, whereas female participants were asked to select an individual from each of eight slides displaying
photographs of males. The eight slides
consisted of three slides displaying individuals with hair color differences, three
slides of individuals with facial expression differences, and two slides of individuals with differing profiles.

Twenty-two photographs of females
were used in producing the hair color
slides shown to the male participants.
The 22 photographs were selected for
inclusion on the basis of their fitting into
one of four groups. One group consisted
of photos of five very attractive females
with lightly colored hair (the base
blonds); another group consisted of
photographs of five very attractive females with dark hair (the base brunettes); another consisted of photographs of six moderately attractive
females with lightly colored hair (the
supplementary blonds); and another
consisted of photographs of six moderately attractive females with dark hair
(the supplementary brunettes). Judgments as to the attractiveness of the individuals in these and other photographs
were made by several students not otherwise involved in this study.

From the four groups of photographs, three types of slides were made.
One type was a series of 18 ‘‘A” slides,
each of which consisted of two rows of
five photographs and which displayed all
five base blonds and all five base brunettes. Each “A” slide consisted of a different randomized arrangement of the
individuals in the ten positions on the
slide. A second type of slide, those belonging to the ““B” series, consisted of 60
slides displaying either one base blond
with the five base brunettes, or one base
brunette with the five base blonds. Six
‘“‘B” slides were made for each blond
displayed with the five base brunettes
and for each brunette displayed with the
five base blonds. Each slide consisted of
six photographs arranged in two rows of
three. The photographs on each slide
were positioned randomly and no two
slides were identical. The third type of
slide, those belonging to the “‘C’”’ series,
consisted of 60 slides displaying either
one base blond with the five base and six
supplementary brunettes, or one base
brunette with the five base and six supplementary blonds. Six slides of each
base blond displayed with the eleven
brunettes, and six slides of each base
brunette displayed with the eleven
blonds were produced. Each “C”’ slide
consisted of twelve photographs arranged in two rows of six. The photographs on each slide were randomly positioned and none of the slides were
identical.

The procedure for producing slides of
females differing in facial expression
was essentially the same as that used to
produce the slides featuring hair color
differences. Twenty-two photographs
were selected on the basis of their fitting
into one of four groups. One group consisted of five photographs of very attractive females with obvious smiles (the

Thelen

base smilers); another consisted of five
photographs of very attractive females
who were smiling only slightly if at all
(the base nonsmilers); another consisted of six photographs of moderately
attractive females with obvious smiles
(the supplementary smilers); and another consisted of six photographs of
moderately attractive females smiling
very little if at all (the supplementary
nonsmilers).

As with the hair color photographs,
three different types of slides were made
from these 22 photographs; an “‘A”’ series, a ““B” series, and a ‘“‘C”’ series.
There were 18 different slides of the five
base smilers and the five base nonsmilers in the “‘A”’ series. There were 60 different slides in the ‘“B”’ series, all of
which displayed either one of the base
smilers with the five base nonsmilers, or
one of the base nonsmilers, with the five
base smilers. There were also 60 different slides in the “‘C”’ series, all of which
displayed either one of the base smilers
with the five base and six supplementary
nonsmilers, or one of the base nonsmilers with the five base and six supplementary smilers.

Only ten photographs were used in
producing slides featuring profile differences. The photographs were selected
for inclusion on the basis of their fitting
into one of two groups. One group consisted of five attractive females displaying a right profile (more of the right side
of the face could be seen than the left
side) and the other group consisted of
five attractive females displaying a left
profile. These photographs were used to
produce two types of slides, an “A”’ and
a ‘“‘B”’ series. The ‘“‘A” slides displayed
all five right profile and all five left
profile photographs. Again 18 different
““A” slides were produced. The ‘“‘B”’ series slides displayed either one right

profile with the five left profile photographs, or a left profile with the five right
profile photographs. Again there were
ten sets of six slides or a total of sixty
slides in this series.

Twenty-two photographs of males
were used to produce the hair color
slides shown to female participants. Another 22 were used to produce the facial
expression slides, and 10 were used to
produce the profile slides. The same
procedure used in producing the slides
of females was used to produce these
slides. Again there were 18 slides in each
‘“*A”’ slide series, 60 in each “‘B”’ slide series, and 60 in each “‘C”’ slide series. The
types and numbers of slides produced
for viewing by the female participants
are listed in Table 1. Since the same
types and numbers of slides were made
for viewing by male participants, this list
also applies for the previously mentioned slides displaying photographs of
females.

All participants in the study were
asked to make their selections from a set
of eight slides displaying individuals of

165

the opposite sex. A set always consisted
of an “A,” a “B,” anda “‘C”’ hair color
slide; an “A,” a “B,” and a “C”’ facial
expression slide; and an “A” and a “B”’
profile slide. Each of sixty classes
viewed unique ““B” and “C”’ slides, but
since there were only 18 different ‘“A”’
slides of a particular type, each of these
slides was shown either three or four
times. When a “‘B” hair color slide with
only one base blond was included in the
set of eight, a “C” slide with only one
base brunette was included in the set.
When a “B” slide with only one base
brunette was included, a ‘“‘C”’ slide with
only one base blond was included. The
same pattern was followed for the ““B”’
and “‘C”’ slides featuring facial expression. When a “‘B”’ facial expression slide
with a single smiler was included, a ““C”’
facial expression slide with only a single
nonsmiler was included. When a ‘“‘B”
slide with a single nonsmiler was included, a ‘“‘C” slide with a single smiler
was included.

The order in which the slides were
shown was randomly determined, but

with the restriction that no two hair
color slides, no two facial expression
slides, and no two profile slides were
shown consecutively. Each slide was
projected on a screen for twenty seconds. After the twenty-second interval,
dim lights were turned on for five to ten
seconds to allow the participants to record the position of the individual they
selected. After the five to ten second interval a new slide was shown. Students
who did not make a selection from each
of the eight slides, non-Caucasians, and
anyone not 18 to 29 years of age were excluded from the study. These exclusions
involved slightly less than 8 per cent of
the students viewing the slides.

Female participants in the study were
treated in the same manner as the
males, though they were asked to make
their choices from slides showing photographs of males. Before any slides were
shown, the participants were provided
with a form on which they could record
their selections and other requested biographical information. Just prior to
showing the slides, the following statement was read to the participants:

In the first phase of this study you will see
groups of photographs projected from
slides. From each group of photographs
you are asked to select the one individual
you would most prefer as your mate in a
long-term husband-wife relationship. It is
important that you select one and only
one individual from each group of photographs. Failure to select an individual or
the selection of more than one individual
from each group will invalidate your entire set of responses. The females in this
class should only respond to the slides
showing photographs of males, the males
in this class should respond only to the
photographs of the females. Anyone not
wishing to participate should leave his or
her entire answer sheet blank. Please do
not make any vocal comments relative to
any individual shown in the slides. The
slides show only Caucasians. This is not

Thelen

intended to slight any ethnic group, but
rather because it is essential to the design
of the study.

THE ANALYSES

To determine whether a minority
type advantage existed, a selection ratio
was determined for each individual
shown in the “A” hair color, facial expression, and profile slides. This ratio
consisted of the number of times a particular photograph was selected over the
number of times this photo or any of the
five photographs of individuals with the
contrasting feature was selected. The
same selection ratio was determined for
each individual when displayed on “B”
slides with five individuals of the contrasting type and for each individual
when displayed on ‘‘C”’ slides with
eleven individuals of the contrasting
type. Since all five individuals of each of
the two contrasting types were shown on
‘“A” slides, the selection ratio determined for these slides was based on a situation in which the frequency of both
contrasting types was 5/10 or 50 per
cent. On the ‘‘B” and “‘C”’ slides, selection ratios were based on slides in which
one of the contrasted types was rarer
than the other type. The frequency of
the contrasted type (the minority type)
on the “‘B” slides was one in six and on
the “‘C”’ slides was one in twelve.

Both observed and expected group
selection ratios were compiled. Observed group selection ratios were computed from “B” and “C” slides using the
individual selection ratios. Each group
selection ratio consisted of the total
number of times all the individuals in a
group were selected when they were the
minority type over the total number of
times a minority type or a contrasting
type was selected. Expected group selection ratios were compiled from the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

Vol. 30, No. 2

expected selection ratios of the individuals, each of which was based on the selection ratio of the individual on the
“A” slides and, therefore, assumed no
minority advantage effect. Each expected group selection ratio consisted of
the total number of times all the individuals in a group were expected to be selected when they were the minority type
over the total number of times a minority type or contrasting base type was selected.

Observed and expected group ratios
were compared and checked for significant differences using a confidence interval method developed for binomial
data described in Steele and Torre, 1960
(pp. 353-358). When the sample size
was sufficient, the upper confidence interval limit (using a one-tailed test) at
the 0.05 level of significance was calculated using the formula:

p +1.645 ( (p-(1-p) )/n)’,

where p is the frequency expected and n
is the denominator of the expected ratio. The upper confidence interval limit
at the 0.01 level was calculated by substituting the value of 2.326 for 1.645 in the
preceding formula. When the sample
size was too small to use this formula, binomial tables (Tables A.14A and
A.14B, Steele and Torre, 1960) were
used to determine upper confidence interval limits.

To determine whether the observed
minority type advantage might be the
result of intrinsic or constant preferences (one not influenced by temporal
rarity), additional data was compiled.
For example, compilations were made
to determine whether participants selecting photographs of blonds from the
‘“‘A” hair color slides were more likely
than expected to select photographs
from the five individuals with the lightest colored hair on the “‘A”’ facial ex

pression and profile slides. Similar compilations were made to determine
whether participants selecting brunettes
on the “‘A”’ hair color slides were more
likely to select photographs of those
with the darkest hair on the “A”’ facial
expression and profile slides. Data was
also compiled to determine whether
participants selecting photos of the smilers on “‘A”’ facial expression slides were
more likely than expected to choose one
of the photographs of individuals with
an obvious smile on the ‘‘A”’ hair color
and profile slides, and to determine
whether participants selecting photographs of nonsmilers on the ‘“‘A”’ facial
expression slides were more likely to select those with less obvious smiles on the
‘“‘A” hair color and profile slides.

Compilations were also made to determine whether participants who selected a right profile photograph rather
than a left profile photograph from the
‘‘A”’ profile slide were more likely than
expected to select such a photograph
from the “A” hair color and facial expression slides, and to determine
whether participants selecting left
profile photos from the ‘‘A’’ profile
slides were more likely to select left
profile photographs from the “A” hair
color and facial expression slides. Some
‘“‘A” hair color and facial expression selections could not be used in these compilations as some individuals on the photographs displayed neither an apparent
right nor left profile.

In each of the compilations the date
from male participants was treated separately from that of the female participants. Determinations of significance
were made using the statistical procedures mentioned previously. Expected
numbers were determined by multiplying the total number of participants selecting a particular type on “A”’ slides

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

168

featuring the characteristic by the percentage of participants selecting that
characteristic on the other types of “A”
slides.

To determine whether the minority
type advantage might be due in part to
preferences influenced by the temporal
rarity associated with the photograph
display (frequency-dependent preferences), a comparison was made of the
number of “A” and “B” selection disparities with the number of “A” and
“C”’ slide selection disparities.

For example, when each of the hair
color photographs was the minority type
on a “‘B” slide and was selected as the
most preferred mate, the “‘A”’ slide selection of the participant was recorded
as to whether it was the same individual,
another individual having the same hair
color, or an individual with the contrasting type of hair color. Likewise, when
each of the base hair color individuals
was the minority type ona “‘C”’ slide and
was Selected as the most preferred mate,
the “A” slide selection of the participant
was recorded.

From this data a ratio (an AB disparity ratio) was compiled, which consisted
of the total number of times the “A”
slide selections of participants selecting
the minority type photograph on the
““B” slides were of the contrasting hair
color type, over the total number of
times the selections were of different individuals with the same or the contrasting type of hair color. The same type of
ratio (an AC disparity ratio) was made
from the selections of participants
choosing the rare type photograph on
the “C” slides.

The two ratios were then compared
using the previously mentioned statistical methods (using the values of the AB
ratios as expected values) to determine
whether the increased rarity present on

Thelen

 

Social Biology

the ‘‘C”’ slides (one in twelve versus one
in six) increased the rate of disparity.
The same procedures were used to compile and analyze ratios based on the facial expression slides. Data from the
male participants was again treated separately from that of the female participants.

RESULTS

The selection ratios (expressed in
whole numbers and as a percentage) for
each individual shown on the “‘A”’ slides
are given in Table 2 (male participant series) and Table 3 (female participant series). These selection ratios represent
the number of times an individual on a
particular slide was selected as the most
preferred mate over the number of
times that individual or one of the five
individuals with the contrasting trait was
selected. The selection ratio on the “A”
slides is based on selection opportunities
from slides allowing the choice of either
of two equally frequent types of individuals. The selection ratio of an individual
on the “B”’ and “‘C”’ slides is determined
only from opportunities when the individual is the minority type. On “B”
slides the frequency of the minority type
characteristic is one in six and on the
““C”’ slides is one in twelve.

From the selection frequencies (the
selection ratios expressed as percentages) shown in Table 2, it appears for
some characteristics that when a particular type is infrequent, the individual
with that type is more likely to be selected than when the type is common.
Furthermore, it appears that when the
particular type is least frequent, the selection frequency is the greatest. This effect is perhaps most evident in the data
of the facial expression slides. Seven of
the females shown as the minority type

on the “‘B”’ slides have a higher selection
frequency than they have on the “A”
slides. Eight individuals shown as the
minority type on the “‘C”’ slides have a
higher selection frequency than they
have on the “‘B”’ slides, and nine have a
higher frequency than on the “fA”
slides.

This effect is also seen to some extent
in the hair color slides shown to the male
participants. Although the ‘“‘B”’ hair
color selection frequencies are higher
than the “A” slide selection frequencies
for only five of ten individuals, the average increase (8.1 per cent) is considerably greater than the average decrease
(1.9 per cent). The selection frequencies
on the “C”’ slides are higher than on the
“B” slides for six individuals and are
higher than on the “‘A”’ slides for eight
individuals. The effect did not occur in
the profile slide series. Only three of the
ten individuals have higher selection frequencies on “‘B”’ slides than on the ““A”’
slides.

Judging from the data in Table 3, the
effect also appears to exist when females
are making the selections, though to a
somewhat more limited extent. On the
facial expression slides, for example, the
selection frequencies are higher on the
“B” slides than they are on the “A”
slides for seven individuals. The selection frequencies are greater on the “C”
slides than on the ‘“‘B”’ slides for seven

slides than on the “‘A” slides for only
five individuals. There is even less evidence of an effect in the profile slide series, where the selection frequencies on
the ““B” slides are greater than on the
““A”’ slides for only five individuals, and
the average increase is only slightly
greater (3.7 per cent), than the average
decrease (2.2 per cent).

The results of the statistical analyses
which involved a comparison of the observed minority type selection occurring
within a group with that expected
(where the expected is based on selection frequencies of individuals from the
‘“A”’ slides, which display an equal number of two contrasting types) are given in
Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 shows that male
participants selected brunettes at a
significantly higher frequency than expected when single brunette was available for selection on both the “B” and
“C” slides. Although the data fails to
provide significant evidence that such an
effect occurred when a single blond was
available for selection, this may be the
result of a sparsity of blond selection asa
whole. When the group selection data
from the blonds and brunettes is combined, the results indicate a significant
increase over that expected in the selection frequency on both the “B” and “C”
slides. The percentage change in the
combined selection ratio from that
based on the “‘A”’ slides for each of the
characteristics is shown in Figure 1.

Table 4 also shows that male partictpants selected smilers significantly more
frequently than expected when the smilers were the minority type on both the
“B” and “C” slides, and that they selected nonsmilers significantly more frequent when nonsmilers were the minority type on the “‘C” slides. Although the
““B” slide group selection frequency of
nonsmilers is higher than that expected,

more frequently than expected. AIthough the smiler and nonsmiler selection frequencies on the ‘‘B”’ slides
(where the frequency of the minority
type is one in six) are higher than expected, the differences are not significant. Combining the data to include
both smiler and nonsmiler “‘C”’ slide selection frequencies produced a group selection ratio significantly higher than expected and significantly higher than that
produced by combining the date of the

There is little evidence to support a
claim of frequency-dependent hair color
or profile preferences among female
participants. Although selection frequencies of both blonds and brunettes
on the “‘B”’ slides are greater than expected, the differences are not significant. Furthermore, the selection frequencies on the ‘“‘C’’ slides are
essentially the same as that expected.
The slightly higher selection frequency
of the minority type in the profile series
has limited meaning as the increase over
that expected is far from significant.

least in part responsible for the minority
advantage phenomenon observed. The
upper half of the table provides data
which indicate that among males intrinsic bias for some characteristics does exist. For example, males choosing blonds
on the “A” hair color slides selected
significantly more individuals with
lightly colored hair than expected on the
‘“‘A”’ facial expression slides and more
(though not significantly more) selected
individuals with the lightest colored hair
on the “‘A” profile slides. Likewise,
males selecting brunettes on the ‘‘A”
hair color slides selected significantly
more individuals with darkly colored
hair than expected on the ‘“‘A”’ profile
slides, and more (though not significantly more) than expected chose individuals with the darkest hair on the ““A”’
facial expression slides.

Statistical evidence of an intrinsic
preference among the males for smiling
or nonsmiling individuals is lacking. It
can be seen, however, that among males
selecting smilers on the “A”’ facial expression slides, more than expected selected smilers on the “A” hair color and
profile slides; and among males selecting nonsmilers on the “A” facial expression slides, more than expected chose
nonsmilers on the “A” hair color and
profile slides. Statistical evidence or any
indication of a trend suggesting an intrinsic bias for individuals displaying a
particular profile is lacking.

The lower half of Table 6 provides
data which indicate that females also
have intrinsic or constant mate selection
bias. The strongest evidence is from the
facial expression series. Of women
choosing a smiler on the “‘A”’ facial expression slides, significantly more than
expected chose one of the individuals
with an obvious smile on the “‘A”’ profile
slides, and more than expected (though

Thelen

Social Biology

not significantly more) chose this same
type on the “A” hair color slides.
Among women choosing nonsmilers on
the “A” facial expression slides, significantly more than expected selected individuals of this same type on the “A”
profile slides, and more than expected
(though again not significant) chose this
type on the “‘A”’ hair color slides.
Statistically significant evidence of intrinsic bias for hair color among females
is lacking. Nonetheless, among females
choosing individuals with lightly colored
hair on the “‘A”’ hair color slides, more
than expected selected individuals with
the lightest colored hair on the “‘A” facial expression slides and on the “A”
profile slides. Among those selecting
brunettes on the ‘‘A”’ hair color slides,
more chose the individuals with the
darkest hair on both the “A” facial expression and profile slides. The data in
the profile series does not lend support
for the existence of intrinsic profile bias.
Table 7 gives the results of the analyses
to determine whether the rarity of a particular type at the time of selection (variable or frequency-dependent bias) was,
in part, responsible for the observed minority advantage phenomenon. A
larger AC disparity ratio as compared to
the AB disparity ratio within a series is
expected if frequency-dependent bias
plays a part in causing a minority type
advantage. From the ratios compiled for
the male participants, it can be seen that
larger AC ratios than AB ratios are
found for both the_hair color and facial
expression slides. Though larger, however, these differences are not significant. On the other hand, for the female
participant series, the AC disparity ratio
is significantly larger than the AB-disparity ratio for both hair color and facial
expression. Although the differences in
the facial expression disparity ratios

DISCUSSION

The results of this study show that
with respect to some characteristics, the
minority type is at an advantage when
preferences for a mate are expressed.
Certainly the process of selecting a photograph from a group of photographs is
not the same as the natural process of selecting a mate. The two processes have a
similar basis, however, and, therefore,
it is reasonable to suggest that the pho
Thelen

Social Biology

tographic selectional process was, at
least to some extent, an indicator of the
process of selecting a mate. Consequently, the results of the study do provide evidence that minority type mating
advantages may exist in man, and,
therefore, may be an important means
of maintaining genetic variability and
promoting outbreeding in the human
population.

A minority female advantage is evident for two of the three characteristics
used in the study. Minority type females
were selected by males more frequently
than expected both on slides contrasting
hair color and on slides contrasting facial expressions. No minority type advantage was found, however, either for
females or for males, on slides contrasting profile differences. This was to some
extent expected, since the profile angle
is the most subtle of the three characteristics, and since it is not actually a phenotypic characteristic of the individuals
shown on the slides.

Evidence of a minority male advantage occurred only with respect to facial
expression. Although a significant male
advantage was not found for hair color,
there is evidence (see Table 7) to indicate that female preferences were influenced by increased rarity of the minority type. It is interesting that the
frequency of minority male selection for
hair color was considerably greater than
expected (though not significantly
greater) when the frequency of the minority type was one in six, yet it was essentially the same as expected when the
frequency of the minority type was one
in twelve. This may be due to sampling
error, though it could be related to a
similar finding reported by Ehrman et
al. (1977), in which a rare type mating
advantage in Drosophila occurred when
the degree of rarity was slight (one in
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 30, No. 2

four), but not when it was high (one in
ten).

The sensory basis for a minority advantage in different organisms seems to
be quite varied. In Drosophila
psuedoobscura, the minority type mating advantage is primarily an olfactory
response, which appears to be based on
the female’s ability to discriminate mixtures of pheromones (Ehrman and Probber, 1978). In Drosophila melanogaster, the recognition of the minority type
appears to be primarily an auditory response (to vibrational cues), and olfactory stimulation appears to be of no importance (Petit and Nouaud, 1975). The
response to the minority type in the parasitic wasp Mormoniella vitripennis is
thought to be at least in part olfactory
(White and Grant, 1977); whereas the
guppy Poecilia reticulata it appears to be
visual (Farr, 1977). The minority advantage in this study was obviously due to
visual stimulation, since the opportunity
for discrimination was restricted to this
sense. Under natural human population
conditions; tactile, auditory, olfactory,
and visual stimulation are probably all
involved to some extent in mate selection and may all be involved in a minority type selectional advantage. Since vision is more highly developed than the
other human senses, however, it seems
likely that vision would be the primary
means of discriminating the rare type in
human populations.

Because this study was visually
based, characteristics with obvious visual differences were selected. Hair color
was chosen as one of the characteristics
because the phenotypic difference between the two contrasted types is evident, yet little or no behavioral differences are associated with individuals
having light- or dark-colored hair. Facial expression, on the other hand, was

Human Mate Preferences

177

chosen because definite behavioral differences are associated with smiling and
nonsmiling individuals. Since a minority
type advantage was demonstrated for
females differing with respect to hair
color and facial expression, and for
males differing with respect to facial expression, it can be inferred that minority
type selection by males may occur for
both behavioral and nonbehavioral
traits, whereas minority type selection
by females might involve only behaviorally based characteristics. An extension
of this finding to mating behavior in general might be that while females select
males on the basis of behavior, males select females on the basis of both their behavior and their physical appearance.

A minority advantage can occur
when some of the individuals doing the
selecting have intrinsic or constant bias
for a particular type. When a particular
type is frequent in the population, those
with an intrinsic bias for that type will
tend to select from among those with
that type. If the frequency of the individuals of the particular types is reduced
and the bias among the selectors for that
type does not change, or does not
change to the extend that occurred in
the type being selected, each of those of
the particular type which remain will
have a greater likelihood of being chosen. If the intrinsic bias among selectors
is reduced to the same extent as occurred in those of the particular type for
which the bias exists, either by a reduction of individuals or a reduction in the
intensity of the bias, the likelihood of selection will not change.

A minority type advantage can also
be caused by preferences which change
in response to the rarity of a particular
type. This cause of the minority advantage is called variable bias or frequencydependent bias. Typically, the minority

178 Thelen

type mating advantage is thought to be
due only to variable or frequencydependent bias, when, in fact, it may be
due to intrinsic or constant bias. Many
of the studies demonstrating a rare male
mating advantage in Drosophila can be
explained on the basis of intrinsic or
constant bias (O’Donald, 1977; DeBenedictis, 1977), since only the males
which were being selected were varied.
If in natural populations the degree of
intrinsic bias is directly proportional to
the frequency of the type being selected,
these studies may be demonstrating an
effect that is unique only to experimentally manipulated populations. The
same criticism can be applied with respect to the findings showing a minority
female advantage in this study, as only
evidence of intrinsic bias was found.
With respect to the minority male advantage, however, the results of the facial expression analyses (see Tables 6
and 7) indicate that in this case the advantage of the rare type is related both
to intrinsic bias and to variable or
frequency-dependent bias.

The minority type mating advantage
phenomenon may be of great importance in both human and nonhuman
populations as a means of maintaining
genetic polymorphisms. If a minority
type mating advantage exists, the rare
type in the population would tend to increase in frequency because of the
fitness benefits associated with being
preferentially selected as a mate. The
type would not become fixed, however,
since as the type became common, its
mating advantage and therefore, any
fitness advantage would be lost. In this
way, stable polymorphisms of genetic
traits could be achieved without heterosis and without accompanying problems
of genetic load common to the heterozygote advantage model. The number of

Social Biology

loci which could be maintained in a polymorphic state by a rare type advantage is
limited, however, just as it is with overdominance. As Lewontin (1974, p. 259)
has said, “A generalized intrapopulation advantage for rare males with respect to almost any genotype could not
exist, if for no other reason than that
every male is genotypically rare in a
population with 10 per cent heterozygosity and 40 per cent polymorphism!”
The minority type advantage may
also be an important means of promoting outbreeding. Rare type individuals
are less likely to be related to an individual that is not the same type than to an
individual that is. Because of frequent
encounters between relatives in many
populations, rare type individuals are
more likely to be perceived as being rare
by nonrelatives than by relatives. Consequently, if a minority mating advantage exists, the effect would act to enhance mating between nonrelatives and
thereby increase the degree of outbreeding. Also the introduction of the
new individuals into a population would
tend to introduce new minority types. If
a minority mating advantage exists for
these types, the participation of these individuals in the mating pool would be
enhanced and, consequently, the degree
of outbreeding within the population
would increase. Farr (1977) has suggested that the rare male mating advantage he observed in guppies was due to
habituation of the females to males with
common color patterns. A different
color pattern exhibited by a male having
an entirely different set of genes acted as
a stimulus to which the female responded by ultimately copulating. This,
Farr suggested, lessens the degree of inbreeding and increases the degree of genetic variability in the females’ off
spring.

As a means of maintaining variability
and increasing outbreeding, the minority type mating advantage would be of
evolutionary value, and for just this reason it might be expected to exist. On the
other hand, the minority type mating
advantage might also maintain deleterious alleles and thereby increase the genetic load. Consequently, it may be
harmful to the population and for this
reason may not exist. Since arguments
both for and against the existence of the
minority type mating advantage can be
made, and since this phenomenon has

been demonstrated only in laboratory
populations, its existence in natural
populations remains open to question.
