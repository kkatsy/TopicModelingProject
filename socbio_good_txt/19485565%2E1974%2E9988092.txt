Family Planning Method Change and

Dropouts in the Philippines

At the present time, 28 nations in the
developing world are implementing family
planning programs in support of official
policies to reduce their rates of population
growth (Nortman, 1972). The considerable
efforts of these countries are hampered by
two factors. These programs have failed
to attract participation by sufficiently large
proportions of the populations of these
societies, and the successful practice of
family planning is all too frequently a
relatively brief event on the part of many
adopters. Discontinuation of contraception
and the related phenomenon of change of
method are closely associated with the
latter problem.

Pregnancy prevention techniques may be
classified into two general categories:
coitus-connected and coitus-independent
(Polgar, 1965). Techniques included in the
coitus-connected category include rhythm,
withdrawal, condom, diaphragm, foam,
and similar approaches. Coitus-independent
techniques are divorced from the sexual
act, and they included oral contraception
(the pill), the intrauterine device (the
IUD), injections of progestational agents,
and male and female sterilization. In general, the coitus-independent methods are
more effective in preventing pregnancy.

While evidence indicates that some coitusconnected methods have a potentially high
degree of effectiveness (Lehfeldt, 1965;
Kantner, 1966), the reliability of others
is questioned (Whelpton and Kiser, 1959).

The use of contraception hinges on
motivation and acceptability of the method
(Pohlman, 1969, p. 351). The decision to
participate in a family planning program
indicates a degree of motivation. Acceptability is a factor in determining whether
the motivation will continue. Interviews by
Rainwater (1960) provided a number of
vivid comments by couples concerning the
nuisance effect of contraception with
coitus-connected methods. This is particularly true for the “masculine” methods of
condom and withdrawal. Westoff (1961)
indicated that women appear to have a
greater capacity to defer impulse gratification required with the use of coitusconnected methods. Rhythm also ranks
low in the acceptability dimension because
of the restrictions it places on sexual
activity. As Pohlman (1969, p. 351) notes,
“A highly effective method may be far
from ideal in terms of its interference with
sex relations, and hence may not be considered highly effective.”

Separating use of contraceptives in time

from intercourse avoids inconvenience inherent with coitus-connected methods. The
IUD may remain in place for an extended
period of time (Segal, 1964). The oral
contraceptive pill, requiring daily use,
avoids inconvenience, but requires a greater
degree of continued motivation. In terms of
acceptability, side effects and the need to
remember the daily routine are major
limiting factors in oral contraception.
Zatuchni (1970, p. 105), reported that
47 per cent of pill discontinuation resulted
from side effects. In a study of a family
planning program in Honduras, it was
found that 70 per cent of those women
who no longer visited family planning
clinics had ceased to use contraception.
Of this group, 54 per cent reported having
problems with family planning methods,
primarily the pill (Nesman et al., 1971).
Using a nationwide probability sample of
women in the United States, Westoff and
Ryder (1968) found that one-third of all
women who reported using the pill for
contraceptive purposes had discontinued
taking it; 65 per cent of these women
stated they had ceased taking the pill
because of side effects. Similar dropout
problems are reported in other studies
(Jones and Mauldin, 1967; Taiwan Population Studies Center, 1968). Ambivalence
has been described as one of the factors
associated with the failure to follow daily
use requirements of the pill (Lehfeldt,
1955; Lehfeldt and Guze, 1966), and some
authors have suggested that side effects
associated with both the pill and the IUD
may be psychogenic (Goldzieher et al.,
1971; Aznar-Ramos et al., 1969; King,
1967).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were collected 1971-72 through
interviews resulting from a series of audits

ten agencies included in these audits oper

ated a number of clinics, which accounted
for about 75 per cent of the family planning acceptors in public clinics in the
Philippines. An auditing firm was employed
to randomly select clinics from each of the

‘agencies to conduct interviews with 30

acceptors, also selected at random from
clinic records. In order to qualify for inclusion in the sample, a clinic must have
been in operation for at least one year and
to have recruited a minimum of 200 reported acceptors. Clinics were expected to
maintain follow-up records on acceptors
and to serve as a source of contraceptive
supplies for those needing them in order to
remain active in the family planning program.

The audits were conducted with a dual
purpose: (1) to determine the accuracy of
information reported in clinic records, and
(2) to ascertain the number of acceptors
who had discontinued use of a family
planning method or moved from the area
served by the clinic. Information in this
report involves only those women who were
interviewed and does not focus upon
migration or inaccuracies detected in clinic
records.

Interviewers were trained by the auditing
firm and, whenever possible, interviews
were conducted in the home of the acceptor.
A total of 1,321 interviews were conducted.
Each respondent was asked which method
she had originally accepted, whether or
not she was continuing with the method,
changed to another method, or discontinued use. When the respondent indicated
that she was no longer practicing family
planning, an effort was made to establish
the reason for termination.

Although clinics included in this report
represented a major portion of reported
acceptors for the Philippines and the selection of both clinics and interviewees involved the use of a table of random

numbers, some limitations are evident.
First, each clinic contributed about the
same number of interviewees regardless of
the number of acceptors on the records.
Second, the absence of information on
selected sample subjects who migrated
from the area creates some bias.

A statistical comparison of women who
continued to practice family planning with
dropouts for coitus-connected and coitusindependent acceptors by means of Yule’s
Q indicated a negligible negative association (—0.006). It appeared that there was
no appreciable relationship between acceptance of a coitus-independent or coitusconnected method and the decision to continue participation in family planning
program, This finding suggests a similar

were continuing, changed methods, or
dropped out of the family planning program. A total of 743 (56.2 per cent) of
the acceptors were continuing with the
method originally accepted at the clinic,
264 (20.0 per cent) changed methods, and
314 (23.8 per cent) reported that they
were no longer participating in family
planning.

Women who accepted a coitus-independent method originally were found to be
more likely to continue with the first
method (59.6 per cent vs. 47.6 per cent),
less likely to change from a coitus-independent to coitus-connected technique (16.5
per cent vs. 28.8 per cent), and to have
relatively the same proportion of dropouts
as coitus-connected acceptors (23.9 per
cent vs. 23.6 per cent).

attrition rate for coitus-connected and
coitus-independent methods, but fails to
explore differences within the categories.

Statistical significance was found for
the comparison between coitus-connected
and coitus-independent methods among
women who continued with the original
method versus those who changed to
another method. Employing Yule’s Q, a
moderate positive association (Q = 0.37)
was found. A 95 per cent confidence interval for Q revealed an upper limit of 4-0.50
and a lower limit of +0.24 (P < 0.025).
Thus, it was found that, while the dropout
rate was not statistically significant between coitus-connected and coitus-independent methods, the proportion of changes
was significant.

Viewed according to specific methods,

Vol. 21, No. 1

the IUD was found to contain the highest

proportion of women who continued with
the original method (64.5 per cent), with
the pill (58.2 per cent) and rhythm (58.1
per cent) ranking slightly lower. A change
of method was most characteristic of those
who originally accepted withdrawal/condom
(54.4 per cent) and “other” coitus-dependent methods (48.3 per cent). The highest
proportion of dropouts were found among
rhythm acceptors (26.7 per cent) and the
pill (26.2 per cent).

CHANGE OF METHOD

In order to explore the possibility of
differential rates of change between methods, the first method accepted was compared with the present method for the
264 women who changed to another pregnancy prevention technique. These data
are presented in Table 2. The 116 women

another technique transferred, with one
exception, to a coitus-independent technique: 25 to the pill, 10 to the IUD, and
only one to withdrawal/condom. A somewhat similar finding was noted for women
who changed from withdrawal/condom to
another method. Of 56 women, 46 accepted
coitus-independent methods (pill, 32; IUD,
14), while the remaining ten continued
with coitus-connected methods. For “other”
coitus-connected methods, 10 of 14 women
moved to coitus-independent methods (pill,
6; IUD, 4) and the remaining four changed
to rhythm (3) and withdrawal/condom (1).
The data strongly suggested a tendency
for women using a_ coitus-independent
method to change to another coitusindependent method, and for women changing from coitus-connected methods to
change to a Coitus-independent method.

who abandoned the pill selected the IUD

changed from the IUD, in four-fifths of

was the pill; in seven cases the women

95 per cent confidence interval revealed
an upper limit of +0.89 and a lower limit
of -+-0.63, indicating Q to be statistically
significant (P < 0.025). Thus, the data
indicate the likelihood that a woman who
abandons a coitus-connected method will
change to a coitus-independent method,
and that coitus-independent changes will
be to another coitus-independent method.

DROPOUTS

An additional dimension involved the
stated reason for dropping out of the family
planning program. Information presented
in Table 4 clearly indicate that “side
effects” are the most common reason for

discontinuing. Of 314 dropouts, 113 (36.0
per cent) listed one or more side effects as
a reason. Side effects included nausea,
headaches, dizziness, nervousness, weight
changes, high blood pressure, allergy to
the pill, and multiple reasons including
several items. Combining “side effects”
(113) with the complaints of IUD expulsion, pain, and bleeding (17), rumors of
side effects (5), and the personal evaluation of the woman that “poor health” was
her reason for discontinuing a method
(19), we find that health-related reasons
account for nearly half (154) of all dropouts.

was pregnancy. Failure was reported by
1.4 per cent of the women who originally
accepted the pill, 3 per cent of the IUD
acceptors, 17.5 per cent of rhythm acceptors, 21.3 per cent of withdrawal/condom
users, and 13.3 per cent for “other” methods. It is evident that coitus-independent
techniques rank considerably higher in
method effectiveness than coitus-connected
methods.

In 23 cases, the woman reported that
her reason for dropping out of the program
was the desire to have another child. The
proportion of women who dropped out of
the program was relatively the same for
coitus-independent acceptors as coitusconnected acceptors (2.3 per cent vs 1.9
per cent). It is interesting to note that
over one-fourth (26.8 per cent) of the
women who dropped out of the program
did so to bear a child. This included the
6f (19.5 per cent) with unplanned pregnancies, and the 23 (7.3 per cent) who
wanted another child.

Objections by the husband to the use
of a contraceptive technique were less
characteristic of women who accepted a
coitus-independent method than for women
using coitus-connected methods. Specifically, 10 women (1.3 per cent) of all
coitus-independent acceptors indicated that
the reason for dropping out of the program
was an objection by the husband. In all
cases, the objection was to use of the pill;
no IUD dropouts were reported because
of objections by the husband. With coitusconnected methods, 4.2 per cent of original
acceptors discontinued use because of objections by the husband. This difference
might be partially explained by the more
active involvement of the husband in
coitus-connected methods; objections by
the husband were noted for rhythm, withdrawal, and condom, but not for other
methods such as diaphragm and foam. No
attempt was made to ascertain the specific

Family Planning Method Change 93

reason for objections by the husband, but
the possibility exists that rumors of side
effects or changes in the wife’s physical
appearance noted by the husband subsequent to her use of the pill could have
been a factor.

Failure to take the pill was reported
by 15 women, or 2.4 per cent of those
who accepted the pill as their first method.
No attempt was made to determine reasons
for failure to take the pill. Forgetfulness
might serve as an explanation, but not an
extremely satisfactory one since the women
could have resumed pill use after an omission, or she could have changed to another
method that did not require her to remember the daily pill routine. Again the possibility exists that “forgetfulness” could serve
to rationalize a decision to terminate family
planning when a more accurate explanation
might be apprehension concerning side
effects. As Rainwater (1960) stressed,
stated reasons frequently serve as rationalizations that may be quite different from
actual reasons. In any event, the immediate goals of the family planning program
were served since failure to take the pill
did not result in pregnancy.

Inconvenience of the method was reported by 6 pill acceptors, 2 rhythm acceptors, and 2 withdrawal/condom acceptors.
Considered in terms of proportions, about
1 per cent of pill and rhythm acceptors
and 2 per cent of the withdrawal/condom
acceptors reported inconvenience as their
reason for dropout.

Absence of the husband from the home
accounted for 16 dropouts, and reaching
menopause was reported by an additional
11 women. Neither of these reasons could
be considered as directly related to acceptance of a coitus-connected or coitusindependent method. Lack of supplies
accounted for only 2 dropouts and suggests
that the distribution system was adequate.

including those who discontinued program
involvement as a result of pregnancy, is
presented in Table 5. The number of
sample subjects using the pill decreased
from 745 to 531, while those employing
the TUD increased from 206 to 214. Respondents using the rhythm method decreased from 236 to 195, while the number
practicing withdrawal or using the condom
decreased from 103 to 42. Persons employing other methods decreased from 29 to 24.
As a result of dropouts and pregnancies,
76 per cent of the women who entered a
family planning program were practicing
a method at the time of the interview. The
per cent in the sample changed from 56.4
per cent to 52.7 per cent between the
original method chosen and the method
currently practiced. For the IUD, the percentage increased from 15.6 per cent to
21.3 per cent, while rhythm increased from
17.9 per cent to 19.4 per cent, withdrawal
and condom decreased from 7.8 per cent to
4.2 per cent, and other methods showed a
relatively small increase from 2.2 per cent
to 2.4 per cent.

DISCUSSION

Several general observations can be made
regarding findings with the population of
this study:

1, Coitus-independent methods are more

effective in the prevention of pregnancy

than coitus-connected methods.
2. Women who change from a_ coitus
connected method are more likely to
change to a coitus-independent method,
while changes from a coitus-independent
technique is likely to be to another
coitus-independent method.

3. The dropout rate is no greater for coitusconnected than coitus-independent methods, although the reason for dropout is
different. A coitus-independent method is
likely to be abandoned because of side
effects, while pregnancy is the most likely
reason to discontinue a coitus-connected
method.

Apparently, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with contraceptive techniques
made available to clients. The finding that
one-fifth of the women changed methods
and that nearly one-fourth abandoned
family planning is evidence that program
effectiveness is limited. A woman who is
dissatisfied with the method accepted at
the clinic will follow one of two courses
of action, depending upon the strength of
her motivation to participate in family
planning: (1) If sufficiently motivated,
she may change to another technique, or
(2) if motivation is weaker, she is likely
to drop out of the program. Considering
that she must have had a degree of motivation for joining the program, the concern
of program personnel is to insure that this
motivation does not diminish. However,
clinic personnel are limited by the resources at their disposal. To recommend
the pill is to invite side effects that may
convince the client to change methods or

dropout; to recommend coitus-connected
methods invites the possibility of method
failure or resistance from the husband.

Evidence from this study indicates that
for this population the IUD provides the
maximum protection from conception with
the minimum likelihood of program dropout. The IUD was found to have the
highest retention rate and the lowest dropout rate. The major negative factor was
the finding that the IUD was more associated with change than either the pill or
rhythm. It is difficult to explain the low
proportion of acceptors for the IUD (i.e.,
less than the pill or rhythm) in the light
of the more favorable results that were
obtained.

Family Planning Method Change

95

An additional consideration is the possibility of adverse publicity resulting from
dissatisfaction with method. While no measure of diffusion was included in the study,
the apparent lack of satisfaction with
methods offered could hardly be expected
to be associated with the communication
of favorable views on contraceptive techniques to other potential acceptors in the
community.

Although coitus-independent methods
hold an advantage in terms of effectiveness, the methods examined in this study
fail to provide an ideal answer to the need
for a contraceptive technique that is both
effective and acceptable for the Philippine
population.
