Black Fertility in Decline:
Urban Differentials in 1900

ABSTRACT: This paper describes variation in urban Black fertility near the turn of the century.
Differentials in both average numbers of children ever born and per cent childless are considered.
The data source is a 1 in 750 sample of households from the 1900 census manuscripts. Higher status
Blacks are found to have lower fertility and a greater incidence of childnessness than are lower
status Blacks. In addition, women experiencing marital disruption have considerably lower fertility
than women in stable unions. The results support previous inferences of deliberate fertility control
by Black women before 1900 and demonstrate the importance of marital instability as a source of

fertility variation in the nineteenth century.

Documentation of dramatic fertility
transitions in nineteenth-century America
is fairly extensive. We know that sectors of
the white population (e.g., New England
native whites ) experienced declines eariy
in the 1800’s and that most remaining
whites followed suit later in the century
(Coale and Zelnik, 1963; Grabill et al.,
1958; Thompson and Whelpton, 1933). It
has also been shown that Black Americans
underwent a dramatic transition to low
fertility levels between 1880 and 1940
(Coale and Rives, 1973). While the forces
underlying historical fertility trends of
both Black and white Americans are
somewhat problematic, explanation of the
Black transition has posed especially serious difficulties.

Up to now, most empirical research
into the Black fertility transition has emphasized occurrences in the twentieth century (e.g., Engerman, 1977; Farley,
1970a; Okun, 1958). However, such discussions overlook a crucial period in the
downward trend of Black fertility rates.
According to Coale and Rives (1973, p.
26) roughly 40 per cent of the decline in
Black total fertility rates between 1850

 

and 1940 occurred before 1900. This sharp
fertility reduction by Blacks at a time
when they were largely a rural, agricultural, and illiterate population seems incongruous with the framework proposed
by transition theory which stresses the
influence of modernization, urbanization,
and lowered mortality (Notestein, 1945;
Thompson, 1929). Recent research, however, has indicated that the genesis of the
Black American fertility transition was
probably in urban areas. For example, estimated trends in total fertility rates between 1886 and 1899 have shown an earlier and steeper decline among urbanites.
Indeed, rural residents apparently did not
begin to reduce their fertility until the
1890’s (Tolnay, 1981). To understand the
origins of the Black fertility transition,
then, it is reasonable to address the issue
of urban fertility variation and its causes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study describes some of the major
sources of Black fertility variation in U.S.
urban areas near the turn of the century.
The investigation is organized around two

separate themes: first, general socioeconomic differentials in number of children
ever born and childnessness; second, the
influence of marital disruption on urban
childbearing. While some description of
urban Black fertility near the turn of the
century already exists (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1943, 1945, 1947; Farley, 1970a,
1970b), the availability of a new data set
allows closer examination of conditions
related to Black fertility near the inception of the decline. Individual-level information from a 1 in 750 sample of households from the 1900 census manuscripts
permits multivariate analyses not generally available in census tabulations (see
Graham, 1980, for a complete description
of the 1900 sample and the sampling procedure). Furthermore, access to the original manuscripts provides greater flexibility in the classification of marital status.
Specifically, married women with spouses
absent were never considered separately
in 1900 census publications.

The 1900 census is the earliest existing
census with data on number of children
ever born (most 1890 manuscripts were
destroyed by fire). In addition to fertility
data, several other useful pieces of information were recorded, such as ability to
read and write, occupation, marital status
and duration. Although different selection criteria are employed at various
stages In the following analysis, all women
considered here were ever-married
Blacks, fifteen years and older, living in
places with more than 2,500 inhabitants.

An apparent lack of association between Black fertility trends and corresponding trends in mortality or social and
economic improvement has led to an emphasis on biological causes of reduced
Black fertility which are rarely mentioned
in relation to white fertility trends. Originally, it was maintained that the spread of
venereal diseases reduced the fecundity of

 

Social Biology

Blacks and thereby lowered their fertility
(Grabill et al., 1958; Kiser et al., 1968;
Thompson and Whelpton, 1933). Eventually the list of factors which might have impaired the fecundity of Blacks was expanded to include pellagra (Farley,
1970a), post-partum septicemia, rickets
(Cutright and Shorter, 1979), and genital
tuberculosis (Pieck, 1979). These physiological explanations for declining Black
fertility have also been used to account for
the sizable proportions of childless women
in the early twentieth century.

Although disagreement with ‘‘impaired fecundity” explanations of Black
fertility variation has existed for some
time (Engerman, 1977; McFalls, 1973),
only relatively recent research has provided hard evidence that deliberate efforts
at family limitation may have contributed
significantly to the Black fertility decline
in the nineteenth century.

George Masnick and Joseph McFalls
(1976, 1978) have persistently claimed
that birth control by Black women was an
important ingredient in the transition to
low fertility levels. Recently they proposed an “alternative view” of the practice of birth control by Black women from
1860 to 1970 (McFalls and Masnick,
1981). Especially noteworthy is their estimate that between 1880 and 1900 (near
the inception of the fertility decline) the
practice of birth control increased from
approximately 15 to 30 per cent of Black
couples. While their data support their arguments about contraceptive practice in
the fourth and fifth decades of the twentieth century, little could be concluded
about nineteenth-century patterns of birth
control, their oldest cohort having been
born between 1916 and 1920. However,
very recent estimates of age-specific marital fertility rates for Blacks between 1886
and 1899 partially confirm inferences
drawn by Masnick and McFalls of deliber

ate fertility limitation in the late nineteenth century. Tolnay (1981) described
urban and rural patterns of Black marital
fertility for two time periods (1886-92 and
1893-99). Though rural residents closely
approximated a “natural fertility” population, urbanites during both time intervals
exhibited age-specific schedules of marital
fertility which suggested considerable fertility control.

Current wisdom attributes the decline
in Black fertility to three major causes:
birth control, mate separation, and impaired fecundity (Masnick and McFalls,
1976; McFalls and Masnick, 1981). Furthermore, Tolnay’s (1981) findings suggest that before 1900 the relative importance of these factors varied by place of
residence. Apparently, conscious birth
control was largely restricted to urban
areas, but within cities it was considerable. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of the origins of voluntarily reduced fertility among nineteenth-century
Blacks, we now turn to the reproductive
patterns of urbanites.

RESULTS

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND URBAN
FERTILITY LEVELS

Although most urban Blacks at the turn
of the century were engaged in menial and
unskilled occupations, some status differentiation did exist. A small group of professionals, skilled workers, and artisans
contributed to the growing (though still
minuscule) middle class, which became
known as the “talented tenth” of the
Black population. The little available evidence suggests that these higher status individuals contributed disproportionately
to the very low fertility levels of Black urbanites in the late 1800’s. Special tabulations of 1910 children-ever-born data

 

 

Black Fertility in Decline 251

(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1947) imply a
sizable fertility differential by husband’s
occupation in cities. The appropriate information is not broken down by urbanrural residence, but a general idea of intraurban fertility variation may be obtained
by examining occupational gradients in
the North and West, since 70 per cent of
all non-Southern Blacks were urbanites.
For example, among currently married
women 45 to 74 years of age in 1910, those
with professional or sem:professional husbands had borne 3.00 children; wives of
clerical, sales, or kindred workers reported 4.20 children ever born; and average completed family size for wives of laborers (except farm and mine) was 5.07
children. Consideration of another indicator of social status, literacy, reveals similarly strong variation (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1945). For ever-married women
45 to 74 living in the North or urban South,
the ability to read and write was associated
with a difference in completed fertility of
1.20 children (literates = 4.61; illiterates
= 5.81).

While the data provided by these special tabulations suggest the importance of
social and economic factors as determinants of urban Black fertility levels in the
late 1800’s, they do not allow the simultaneous consideration of several variables to
control for spurious associations and to estimate the net effect of particular sources
of fertility variation. In this section, the
1900 Public Use Sample of urban Blacks is
used to conduct a Multiple Classification
Analysis (MCA) (Andrews et al., 1973) of
the fertility of married, spouse-present,
Black women 15 to 44 years of age. Three
indicators of family social status are considered: wife’s literacy, husband’s literacy, and husband’s occupation. The small
sample size and paucity of Black men in
higher status occupations forced us to settle for a simple occupational dichotomy—

252 Tolnay

unskilled labor versus all others.! During
the analysis, controls are employed for region of residence, labor force status of the
wife, and the couple’s marital duration.

The results from the MCA are presented in Table 1. Column 1 shows the unadjusted means of children ever born; and
Column 2 reports corresponding means
after they have been adjusted for the effects of all other variables in the analysis.
Looking first at the unadjusted means, we
find relatively large differences in fertility
between Southern and non-Southern
cities, and between illiterate and literate
husbands and wives. Only moderate variation is found by husband’s occupation
and wife’s labor force activity. All of these
“zero-order” differences are in the expected direction with the exception of
wife’s work status, which shows working
women to have somewhat higher fertility
than nonworking women.

When the effects of all other variables
are controlled, most differentials are reduced, suggesting the interdependence of
the various items of interest. Although
still in the expected directions, variation
of wife’s literacy shrinks from 1.05 to 0.31
children; the difference by husband’s literacy drops from 1.19 to 0.39 children; and
the effect of husband’s occupation is reduced from 0.49 to 0.37 children. These

‘Any dichotomous occupational classification is
certain to be somewhat imprecise. The scheme used
here distinguishes between Black men engaged in laboring occupations and all other men. Of all laborers, 28 were engaged in agricultural work and 172
were nonagricultural workers. The “higher status”
category is a diverse mix of occupations not strictly
laboring jobs. There is a fair amount of heterogeneity within this category, and some “‘nonlaboring”
occupations actually may have a good deal in common with the ‘low status”’ category. Included in this
group are 5 professionals; 28 craftsmen and foremen;
33 operatives and kindred workers; and 54 service
workers. Service workers are the most problematic,
and a case could be made for considering them “unskilled laborers.’’ However, the majority of service
workers were waiters and porters, and it was decided
these occupations required somewhat greater training and “social skills” than the average unskilled Iaboring occupation.

results indicate nearly equal importance
of the social status indicators included
here and demonstrate the necessity of simultaneously considering several characteristics. Clearly, a misleadingly large differential might be attributed to one
indicator of status if the others were not
accounted for.

Though the independent effects of the
three status variables are statistically
insignificant, and rather modest when
taken alone, it is useful to ask how certain
combinations of the characteristics are
reflected in differences of average numbers of children ever born. Dummy variable regression analysis was used to duplicate the MCA results shown in Table 1.

ate couples with the husband engaged in
unskilled labor.2 These calculations yield
values of 3.49 for “lower status” couples
and 2.43 for “higher status” couples. At
the extremes, then, differences in social
status among urban Blacks were responsible for roughly a one-child difference in
fertility. Smaller, though still sizable, differences existed by literacy of the couple
alone. Other things being equal, literate
couples had borne an average of 2.63 children, while illiterate couples reported an
average of 3.32 children ever born.

In short, it appears that social status
was a fairly important source of fertility
variation among urban Blacks at the turn
of the century. Even the rather crude indicators available from the 1900 census
manuscripts are associated with moderate
differences in fertility—especially when
considered jointly. The existence of social
Status fertility gradients for Blacks is consistent with similar variation found for urban whites (Kiser, 1932). Furthermore,
when considered in conjunction with evidence that urban Blacks practiced deliberate family limitation in the late nineteenth
century (Tolnay, 1981), such gradients
lend support to the conclusion that nonphysiological factors were important contributors to the low levels of urban fertility, and to the dramatic transition in Black
fertility which occurred between 1880 and
1900. In addition, a negative association
between social status and fertility would
seem to be largely contradictory to explanations which emphasize biological causes
of reduced Black fertility, since poorer,
less sophisticated sectors of the Black population presumably would have been

more susceptible to involuntary impairments to their fecundity.

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND URBAN
CHILDLESSNESS

Historical levels and trends in Black
childnessness have attracted a good deal
of attention. Childlessness has generally
been considered the result of sterility, and
involuntary impairments to fecundity
have occupied center stage in explanations of Black fertility trends. Most discussions of Black childlessness focus on those
cohorts who reached childbearing age
during the depression and who reported
levels of childlessness which have not been
surpassed. Such fertility behavior appears
to violate our assumptions that normative
pressures require all women to desire at
least one child. Consequently, physiological explanations are generally invoked to
explain these high levels of childlessness.
With respect to the initiation of the Black
fertility transition, however, childlessness
in the late nineteenth century is more germane.

Actually, the available evidence suggests that childlessness among Black
women as a whole was not very different
from white childlessness before the turn of
the century. Cutright and Shorter (1979)
have estimated parity progression ratios
for Black and white birth cohorts from
1868 to 1934. Examination of their earliest
cohort reveals that 80 per cent of whites
and 83 per cent of nonwhites bore at least
one child. In addition, Farley’s estimates
(1970a, p. 95) for earlier birth cohorts suggest little difference between Blacks and
whites. For example, among ever-married
women born between 1845 and 1854, 7 per
cent of Blacks and 8 per cent of whites remained childless.

There was, however, substantial urban-rural variation in Black childlessness.
Among all ever-married Black women
45-74 years at the time of the 1910 census,

254 Tolnay

11.3 per cent of non-Southerners or
Southern urbanites were childless, while
only 4.3 per cent of Southern rural residents remained at parity zero. When compared with levels of childlessness for native whites, these percentages do not seem
unusual. Childlessness among native
whites reached 11.3 per cent for urbanites
and 7.8 per cent for rural residents (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1945, Tables 81 and
82).

Some idea of socioeconomic gradients
in childlessness can also be obtained from
tabulations for Black women from the
1910 census. Since separate information
was not presented for urban and rural residents, the available data are rather crude.
Nonetheless, among ever-married Black
women 45-74 years of age in 1910, 10.6
per cent of all literates and only 6 per cent
of all illiterates remained childless. Occupational variation in childlessness was
equally impressive. Once-married Black
women (45-74 years) living with their
spouse in Northern or Western states at
the time of the 1910 census exhibited the
following differential in childlessness by
occupation of husband (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1945, p. 173; 1947, pp.
210-211): professionai and semiprofessional workers, 35.7 per cent childless;
clerical workers, 20.7 per cent childless;
and laborers (except farm and mine), 15.3
per cent childless.

Undoubtedly, some childlessness for
both races was due to primary sterility and
subfecundity. However, to attribute childlessness among Blacks to involuntary factors alone, when the levels and urbanrural differentials were very similar to
those for native whites, seems unwarranted. Childlessness is, without question,
an extreme form of fertility control. Nevertheless, several researchers have concluded that a good deal of childlessness in
modern societies is voluntary (Cutright
and Polonko, 1977; Freshnock and Cu
Social Biology

trighit, 1978; Poston, 1976; Veevers,
1971). And, very recent research has suggested that even among nineteenthcentury native white women, a substantial
proportion of childiessness was by deliberate design rather than involuntary (Tolnay
and Guest, 1982). Moreover, McFalls and
Masnick (1981) have shown that among
Black women born between 1916 and
1920, childless women were the first to begin contracepting after the initiation of
regular intercourse—indicating a deliberate effort to avoid pregnancy.

Ir this section we explore further the
nature of childlessness among urban
Blacks in the late nineteenth century. Obviously, without information about fertility intentions and reproductive capacity,
we can not decisively determine whether
most childlessness was voluntary or involuntary. It is possible, however, to describe
socioeconomic differentials in childlessness, and to assess their consistency with
arguments which claim significant impairments to urban Black fecundity. Our sample during this analysis consists of all married, spouse-present, urban women who
were at least thirty-five years of age and
had been married for at least five years.
Although some of these women may have
had their first birth in subsequent years, it
seems safe to conclude that the vast majority of those who were childless would
remain so. The sample restrictions have
severely reduced the number of cases
(N= 114), so caution should be used when
interpreting the results. Once more, MCA
is used, with childlessness (1=no children; 0=1+ children) as the dependent
variable.3 Our principal independent variables are wife’s work status, wife’s literacy, husband’s literacy, and husband’s oc
3Strictly speaking, Multiple Classification Analysis is not the most appropriate technique to use with
a dichotomized dependent variable. However, similar results were obtained when log-linear methods
were used to replicate the analysis of childlessness.

cupation. Region of residence and
woman’s age are employed as controls.
Table 2 suggests that childlessness was
more common in non-Southern cities, for
working women, and with one exception,
among higher status Blacks. The regional
effect is consistent with the South—-nonSouth differential in cumulative fertility
described in Table 1. And, while the
influence of wife’s work status on childlessness is also consistent with what we
might predict, it is difficult to sort out
causal direction. Childless women simply
may have had more freedom to work outside of the home. Turning to our indicators of the social status of married couples,
the adjusted means show that literate
women, and women married io men with
higher status occupations, were more
likely to be childless. In contrast to this
pattern, however, women with literate

husbands are found to have somewhat
lower levels of childlessness than women
married to illiterates. It must be admitted
that we have no convincing explanations
for the opposite effects of husband’s and
wife’s literacy. It should be pointed out,
though, that intercorrelations among the
social status variables may interfere with
estimates of their independent effects. For
example, male and female literacy are correlated (r=0.60), and husband’s literacy
and occupation are correlated (r=0.34).

In recognition of the mtercorrelations
among the independent variables, and
since no single indicator is a statistically
significant predictor of childlessness, it is
once again useful to estimate the effects of
a couple’s social status when characteristics are combined. Using unstandardized
regression coefficients and means from a
dummy variable multiple regression analysis (including the same variables used in
the MCA),4 and assuming constant residence, age, and wife’s work status, we find
23.2 per cent childless for higher status
couples (doth literate, husband in higher
status occupation) and only 13.5 per cent
childless among lower status couples
(both illiterate, husband in lower status
occupation).

In sum, status differentials in urban
Black childlessness are largely consistent
with similar differentials in average number of children ever born. It would appear
then that childlessness in this population
was, to a certain extent, a specific type of
reproductive strategy which responded in
the usual ways to social and economic conditions; and that it was not necessarily a
pathological condition explained by the
unhealthful situation of urban Blacks, Of

course, involuntary sterility also must
have accounted for some percentage of
childless women.

MARITAL DISRUPTION AND URBAN FERTILITY

Although rates of illegitimacy historically have been higher for Blacks than for
whites, the majority of births to Black
women in the late nineteenth century occurred to married couples. When marital
unions are interrupted, because of mortality or separation, exposure to intercourse
and conception is reduced and fertility
levels are likely to drop (Davis and Blake,
1956). Mate exposure has not received as
much attention as birth control and fecundity impairments as a cause of Black fertility variation and trends in the past. However, considering the extent of marital
instability among urban Blacks in the late
nineteenth century, the implications for
fertility are an important subject for investigation.

There is an extensive literature on the
stability of the Black family following the
Civil War (see Frazier, 1968; Furstenberg
et al., 1975; Gutman, 1975, 1976; Moynihan, 1965; Pleck, 1972). While we will not
review that literature here, it should be
pointed out that marital disruption was
greater among urban than rural blacks.
Generally, the research dealing with
Black family stability attempts to prove or
dispel the notion that female-headed
households in the twentieth century are a
“legacy of slavery,” and only rarely are
the implications of marital disruption for
fertility mentioned. Lammermeier (1973,
p. 451) did note that among urban Blacks
in the Ohio Valley between 1850 and 1880
‘“‘we find males heading more families of
four or more persons, while women
tended to head small households.’’ However, he was unable to untangle the effects
of extended households, widowhood, and
fertility levels on household size.

In this section we attempt to assess the

 

Social Biology

impact of marital disturbances on the fertility of urban Black women in 1900. The
sample consists of all ever-married women
who were between the ages of 15 and 44 at
the time of the census. The primary independent variable is marital status. We will
distinguish between those who were (1)
married with spouse present, (2) married
but separated or divorced from their
spouse, and (3) widows.’ Since formal divorce was so rare for this population (only
1.2 per cent of all ever-married women),
separation accounts for most of the separated or divorced category. Again, the dependent variable is number of children
ever born; and MCA is the analytic technique. Control variables include region of
residence, literacy, work status, and age
of the women.

Before discussing the MCA results, it is

‘useful to describe the overall distribution

of marital statuses in this population and
to contrast it with that for comparable
white women. Table 3 shows that only
66.9 per cent of all ever-married Black
women were still living with their spouse
at the time of the census—a considerably
smaller figure than the 88.8 per cent of
white women living with a spouse. The
less frequent cohabitation among Black
couples was the result of two factors.
While nearly one out of five Black women
reported a dead spouse, only 6.5 per cent
of white women were widows. This is not a
surprising result given our knowledge of
higher mortality for Blacks near the turn

can not distinguish first marriages from remarriages.
Obviously, those married, spouse-present women
who were remarried probably spent more time unexposed to reproduction than first-married women
with the same characteristics. Second, it is not possible to estimate length of widowhood. Consequently,
we must lump together 44-year-old women who were
widowed at age 43 and those whose husbands died
when they were 20. Clearly, widowhood would have
a greater effect on the fertility of the second group.

women with a living spouse were more
likely than whites to live separately from
their husband. Fully 12.5 per cent of all
ever-married Black women (or 15.7 per
cent of currently married women) were
not living with their husbands. Only 4 per
cent of urban whites were married but separated. This element of Black marital disruption was obscured in the published volumes of the 1900 census which reported
only a category of married Black women
and did not differentiate those with
spouses present and those with spouses
absent. Clearly, the degree of marital disruption described in Table 3 could have
had a sizable impact on the exposure of urban Black women to intercourse and conception and thereby have affected their
fertility.

Turning to the results from the Multiple Classification Analysis shown in Table
4, we find that marital status has a substantial, though statistically insignificant, effect on number of children ever born. The
relationship is evident in differences between both the unadjusted and adjusted
means. However, since widowhood was
more common among older women, who
also had had more time to bear children,
the adjusted means deserve more atten

tion. Other things being equal, women living with a spouse reported the highest fertility (2.94 CEB); widows had the fewest
births (2.35 CEB); and separated or divorced women occupied a middle position
(2.55 CEB). The independent effect of
marital disruption, then, was to reduce
fertility by one-half to six-tenths of a child,
depending on the type of disruption. Considering the extent of such conjugal interruptions among urban Blacks, the implications for fertility are apparent.

That mate exposure was an important
element of Black fertility trends and variation has also been inferred by Masnick and
McFalls (1976, 1978). Their data have
shown that the proportion of time spent in
unions during the most fertile years
(20-29) was positively related to the number of children ever born to the 1916-20
birth cohort. These two sets of findings
suggest, then, that mate exposure (or marital instability) was an influential determi

nant of Black fertility at the inception and
the conclusion of the fertility transition.

Interpretation of the marital disruption
effect is somewhat problematic. That is, it
is difficult to determine whether the effect
should be attributed to voluntary or involuntary factors. Most likely a combination
of the two was at work. For example,
while the death of a husband would be an
involuntary factor, the wife’s postponement of remarriage might be a voluntary
factor and might be due to a reluctance to
be exposed to childbearing once again. In
addition, McFalls (1981, p. 10) has suggested that some Black live-in domestics
may have been seeking to reduce their exposure to intercourse and conception. In
the absence of more information, perhaps
the best policy is to treat marital instability
(or mate exposure) as a separate and distinct factor influencing historical Black
fertility patterns and to recognize that it
had voluntary and involuntary components.

DISCUSSION

A general understanding of the dramatic decline in Black fertility rates which
occurred between 1880 and 1940 is beginning to emerge. It now appears that urban
Blacks initiated the fertility transition and
that birth control (including abortion)
played amore important role than has typically been recognized (McFalls, 1981;
McFalls and Masnick, 1981; Tolnay,
1981). The results presented here are from
a “‘snapshot” in historical time and can not
speak directly to the nature of trends in
Black fertility. Nevertheless, it 1s believed
that certain important inferences can be
gleaned from our findings and the results
of previous research.

The socioeconomic differentials we
have described in Black fertility and childlessness are not unique—and that is noteworthy. In general, higher status urban

 

Social Biology

Blacks were exercising greater control
over childbearing than were lower status
Blacks. Kiser’s results (1932) would have
us believe the same of urban whites during
roughly the same period of time. Second,
such differentials are contradictory to
what common sense would tell us about.
the effect of VD and poor health on fertility. For example, McFalls (1973, p. 8) has
noted that ‘“‘childlessness in 1940 was most
common among Black women of higher
educational attainment. Such women
would be expected to have fewer cases of
VD and better treatment once infected.
This is only one of a group of socioeconomic-fertility differentials which go in a
direction opposite to that expected if the
VD-childlessness [and fertility] hypothesis was valid.”’ Clearly, the same could be
said of the SES gradients in fertility and
childlessness found in this study.

Our results also point to the important
influence of marital disruption on urban
Black fertility. Actually, our findings provide a conservative estimate of the marital-instability—-fertility relationship. We
were able to measure spouse separation
only at the time of the census. Most likely,
some married spouse-present women had
experienced earlier marital disruption
which was reconciled by the time they
were enumerated. Furthermore, some
spouse-present women were remarried
widows who were not exposed to conception for a period of time after the death of
their husband. Nevertheless, even our
‘“‘conservative estimate’’ suggests that
marital disruption deserves greater attention in the study of historical patterns and
trends in Black fertility.¢

*There were many possible causes of marital disruption among urban Blacks, and it should not be inferred that simple spouse incompatibility was the
most important. A good deal of spouse separation
was probably due to the migration of Black men
seeking employment. Furthermore, some occupations, for example train porters, required the husband to be absent from home.

It is important to recognize that fertility
limitation by higher status urban Blacks is
not a sufficient explanation for the decline
in fertility levels for the total Black population in the late nineteenth century.
Throughout the period 1880 to 1900, the
urban Black population never exceeded
23 per cent of the total, and higher status
Blacks were only a very small minority of
all urbanites. That fertility control had diffused to lower status urban Blacks is
strongly suggested by the large difference
in completed fertility between all urban
and all rural residents. Among women
45-54 years of age in 1900, rural residents
had borne 7.63 children while the average
family size for urbanites was only 4.45
children (computed from 1900 Public Use
Sample). Clearly, there were aspects of
urban living in general which had depressing effects on the fertility of all city residents—not just the urban elite. In addition, residence-specific estimates of Black
fertility rates in the late 1800’s suggest that
rural residents also contributed to reductions in Black fertility, though apparently
rural declines were not the result of much
deliberate fertility control (Tolnay, 1981).
Both the specification of urban conditions
which discouraged childbearing and the
investigation of causes of reduced rural
fertility will require additional research.

 

Black Fertility in Decline 259

It may seem that we have paid too little
attention to the effect of physiological factors on urban fertility. We have chosen to
emphasize the social and economic predictors of fertility for two important reasons. First, the 1900 census manuscripts
really do not allow a direct assessment of
the influence of biologically caused differentials in Black fertility (unless, perhaps,
as they affect childlessness). Second, too
little description has been offered of socioeconomic variation in urban Black fertility
during the nineteenth century. We hope
that this discussion will put Black fertility
in better historical perspective and help to
reduce the emphasis on its “‘unique” character. Undoubtedly, there were physiological causes of low fertility among urban
Blacks, and most likely they also played
some role in the dramatic decline in Black
fertility. However, we should not lose
sight of the social and economic factors
which also were operating.
