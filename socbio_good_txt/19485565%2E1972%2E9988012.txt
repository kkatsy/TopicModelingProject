The Fertility of a Sample of
American Elites

Beginning with the Indianapolis Study
(1941) and proceeding through the National Fertility Survey, we have learned a
great deal about the fertility of many different subgroups in the American population and the factors which influence their
fertility performance. More recently, poverty and minority groups have been singled
out for special attention. While our knowledge about the fertility of these groups is
not complete, there is evidence to indicate
that the amount of research on such groups
is increasing (Rainwater, 1960; De Jong,
1968; Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969;
Sly, 1970).

Despite the increased attention given to
“special groups,” there continues to be one
group which can neither be isolated from
census data nor contacted by the “pad and
pencil corp” which emerged with the advent
of survey research. We refer here to the
American elite. The present paper reports
the results of one modest effort to investigate the fertility of this segment of the
population. More specifically, three objectives have been set: (1) to compare the
fertility of elites with the fertility of the
American population in general; (2) to examine the fertility of elites by selected
differentials; and (3) to examine the historical trend in elite fertility.

THE SAMPLE

It has been noted on numerous occasions
that elite group membership is not determined by a one-dimensional scale. The
most recent studies to take this position
are Keller (1963, p. 4-6) and Lenski
(1966, p. 78-79). The point of consensus
among authors who have dealt with the
topic of elites and various aspects of their
behavior, however, appears to be that in
demarcating this group one must consider
a functional (objective) criteria as well as
a prestige (subjective) criteria. In stratification theory, the former is emphasized by
the functionalist (for example, see Davis
and Moore, 1945) and the latter by the
more social psychological approaches such
as that employed by Warner and his associates (1948). Baltzell (1953¢) has argued
that a workable operational technique
whereby this two-dimensional approach
could be considered is through a crossclassification which would sample individuals whose names appear in both Who’s
Who in America and the Social Register of
the various cities having such listings. He
notes that persons whose names appear in
the former are the functional leaders in our
society to the extent that they are the
leaders in their professions, while persons

394.

whose names appear in the latter are the
prestige leaders.

To bring our sample in line with this
two-dimensional view of elites, our primary
criteria for inclusion was that a person’s
name appear in both a Social Register and
Who’s Who. We began with the Social
Register for each of the eleven cities having
such listings (New York, Buffalo, Boston,
St. Louis, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
and Cincinnati-Dayton), taking the first
male on page 4 who was over 40, then the
last male on page 8 who was over 40, and
proceeded to follow this first-last criterion
on every fourth page. It was necessary
throughout to cross-check age with the
Who’s Who listings since age was not reported in the Social Register.

The vast majority of data collected was
taken from Who’s Who; however, in those
cases where data reports were incomplete
in the Who’s Who, mail questionnaires
were sent out. Of the 371 men in the
original sample (names appearing in both
Who’s Who and the Social Register), complete data files were obtained for 359 evermarried males. These men constitute the
sample upon which our analysis is based.

For purposes of analysis, we have assumed that these men have completed their
fertility. To some this may appear to be a
rather naive assumption, as indeed it does
to the authors. The naivete of the assumption, of course, rests primarily on the facts
that the male potential to impregnate does
not decline at 40 and that males of age 40
are likely to have spouses younger than
themselves, and thus still in childbearing
ages. The assumption, however, does make
it less likely that we will overstate the
findings reported below and therefore tends
to lend a conservative tone to our conclusions. .
The variable of chief concern in our

 

Sly and Ricards

Social Biology

analysis, fertility, is measured by the number of children ever born to each evermarried male. The accuracy of this figure
may be questioned on the grounds that men
may vot include children by previous marriages; however, we originally tabulated
children separately by sex of child and by
the number of marriages to reduce the
chances of this happening. Whenever we
had reason to expect a multiple marriage, a
mail questionnaire was sent to the respondent.

ELITE FERTILITY

The view most often expressed in introductory texts concerning the relationship
between socioeconomic status and fertility
is that “The general relationship is a negative one: the higher socioeconomic status
groups have the lowest fertility” (Stockwell, 1968, p. 118). While this relationship
has been repeatedly demonstrated for aggregates, some have argued that it cannot
be ubiquitously accepted. Hawley (1950,
p. 114-119), for instance, argues that this
relationship represents a transitional phase
in the general decline of birth rates and
that as societies increasingly modernize
there will emerge a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and fertility
because of the declining economic advantage
of having children and because of the effective spread of family planning. Goldberg’s
(1960) reexamination of the Indianapolis
data strengthened a positive relationship
between socioeconomic status and fertility _
among family planners when length of
urban residence was taken into account.

Other studies have established the possibility of a positive relationship existing
between income and fertility within categories of socioeconomic status. Deborah
Freedman (1963), for instance, has shown
that for fecund planners there is a positive
relationship between relative income and

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

Vol. 19, No. 4

number of children within categories of income status, but that higher categories of
income status have fewer children. |

Thus, although the evidence. is not unequivocal, one would probably tend to expect relatively larger families among our
sample of elite males. Kiser and Schacter
(1949, p. 421-431) studying women in the
1948-1949 Who’s Who, however, report an
average of only 1.3 children per ever-married women 40-74. This figure would tend
to support the supposition that we should
expect smaller families among the elite,
since the average number of children born
to the corresponding age group in the 1940
census was 3.2. Working with women in
Who’s Who, however, may not accurately
reflect the fertility of elites in general, since
these women were selected for their functional contribution and this contribution
probably requires a reduction in fertility.
An alternative possibility is that women incapable of bearing children turn to careers
and excel in them because of their lack of
family responsibilities. This is indicated by
the fact that the authors note, “in each
category the percentage of Who’s Who
women classified as childless, is more than
double that for women in the 1940 Census”
(p. 427). The authors’ position is summed
up in the statement, “there is little doubt
that this group is considerably less fertile
than women of similar age in the general
population” (p. 425). However, Frank and
Kiser (1965) report that there is a trend
toward higher fertility among women in
Who’s Who, Several studies of elite fertility have been primarily concerned with
social mobility and fertility (Baltzell,
19356, Tomasson, 1966).

Our sample of elite men tends to conform
to national norms when their average
fertility performance is compared to that
of most national samples. The mean number of children born to the 359 males was

2.68. While the two groups are not strictly
comparable, it is particularly striking to
relate this figure to the corresponding figure
for the total number of ever-married
women forty and over in the nation in
1960 (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1964,
p. 6, 8). This group had on the average
2.69 children indicating that our sample of
elite males matched nearly identically the
fertility performance of the national aver- age for a group of ever-married females. It
should be recalled, however, that we expect
this estimate for elite males to be conservative in the sense that it probably does not
indicate completed family size. Assuming
that the female national figure comes closer
to estimating completed fertility, there does
appear to be grounds for expecting that
elite family size on the average is larger
than family size in the general population.

This is further amplified by a somewhat
more refined comparison. The 1960 Census
(U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1964, p. 94—
97) shows the number of children ever
born to married women by age of woman,

396

husband present, by age of husband for the
white urban population. Thus, by summing
the number of children born to women at
all ages whose husbands are over 40 and
dividing by the number of women, we can
obtain an estimate of the average number
of children born to wives whose husbands
are over 40. The resulting figure is more
comparable to our estimate for elites and
tends to confirm the expectations of larger
families. among the elite since the average
based on census data is only 2.42. Unfortunately, we know nothing about the comparability of the age structure of the wives
of the elites and the age of the wives in the
census sample.

Some indication of what produces the
mean difference in number of children born
to these two groups can be gained by examining the distributions in Table 1. Almost
equal proportions are found to be childless
or to have one or two children. The similar
proportion having two children (about
24%) in each group is particularly striking,
as is the similar proportion (about 8%)
having five or more children. The major
differences between the two groups appear

to be in the proportions having three and

four children. Here we find that 8% fewer
of the elites have three children, but that
about 12% more have four children.

This could be interpreted to indicate that
elites have less control over their fertility
than the general population or that they
have a preference for larger families. It is
the latter of these possibilities which appears to be the most probable. When we
recall the mean difference between the two
groups and take note of the fact that considerably more elites have four children, it
seems reasonable to conclude that there is
quite likely a preference for slightly larger
families among the elites. This seems more
likely when we also consider that contraception is more likely to have been available to the elite group. Some may object to

Sly and Ricards

Social Biology

this interpretation on the grounds that the
1965 National Fertility Survey indicated
that women at all income levels desired to
have about the same number of children.
We should note, however, that our definition of elites goes beyond a mere income
categorization and that some authors
making extensive use of data from this
source admit this possibility: “There is
some speculation that the real terminal
point of this transition may be a situation
in which socioeconomic status and fertility
are directly correlated, that is, where the
number of children born will be a function
of the couple’s ability to afford them”
(Westoff and Westoff, 1971, p. 221-222).

DIFFERENTIALS IN ELITE FERTILITY

Three factors repeatedly mentioned in
studies of fertility differentials are age at
marriage, education, and religion. Studies
of the fertility behavior of national samples
have indicated that each of these factors
has an influence on completed family size.
Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the relationship
between each of: these factors and fertility
among our elite sample.

The average age at first marriage for our
sample is 27.6. From this figure and the
data in Table 2 we can see that the age at
first marriage among our elite sample is
later than the age at first marriage is generally thought to be for United States
males. One-third of the men in the sample
married between the ages of 26-29, and
nearly 38% of the men did not enter into
their first union until after the age of thirty.
Despite this, we can see that age at first
marriage has little effect on the outcome of
fertility until the upper limit considered
here. That is, on the average, the men in the
sample had between 2.6 and 2.8 children
unless they married after the age thirtyfour when their average fertility appears to
have reduced considerably. It is also possible, however, that the males in this latter

group will complete their fertility at later
ages because of their relatively late start
at family formation. The similar average
number of children born to the first three
‘“age-at-first-marriage categories” may also
be interpreted as further evidence of the
control of this group over its fertility.
However, the differences observed in this
table could also result from the interaction
of a complex of factors related to the
mobility aspirations, starting position, education, and career patterns of the elite.
As one would expect, the majority of the
men in our sample are college graduates;

however, one-fifth of the men either did not
attend college or did not graduate from
college. All of the men in the sample did
graduate from high school. The data in
Table 3 tend to suggest that those men
who did not graduate from college had to
reduce their fertility to maintain or obtain
their position. That is, the men in both
educational categories (high school grads
and some college) who did not graduate
from college had on the average fewer
children than did the elite men on the
average; and axiomatically, those men who
did graduate from college had on the average more children than did the elite in
general. Moreover, those men with some
college had on the average the fewest children, further suggesting that perhaps their
marginal educational status required the
greatest sacrifice. This latter point tends to
add support to the work of Freedman
(1963) mentioned earlier and is supported
by the findings of Baltzell (19535) and
Tomasson (1966).

The religion variable produces the most
salient difference in fertility performance
among our elites; however, this difference
is the reverse of what we would expect.
That is, Catholics on the average had fertility which was markedly lower than that
of the elites who were Protestant. Thus,

398

once again we find that when the men in
our sample possess a status which is in
conflict with their elite position then their
fertility is on the average lower than that
of the elites in general, suggesting that a
reduction in fertility is part of the “price”
which must be paid to obtain or maintain
the elite position.

Finally, we can ask what is the magnitude of change in elite fertility over the
years? To investigate this question, we
have broken our sample of elite males into
five-year cohorts as shown in Table 5. If

the case of those men who were 70-74 in
1963 that part of their fertility was curtailed by the Depression. However, because
their average is identical to that of the men
who completed their fertile period prior to
1928, it is also possible that the averages
reflect a pre-Depression preference with respect to elite family size.

The next category of fertility performance includes the three cohorts which entered the fertile period in 1919, 1924, and
1929, These men had on the average about
2.4 children, and their performance was

we assume that these men have a “fertile
period” of fifteen years spanning the ages
from 25-40, the last column of the table
shows the years during which each cohort
passed through this period. The second to
the last column shows the average number
of children ever born to each cohort’s members. These data strongly suggest that
there are marked differences in the fertility
of the various five-year cohorts.

Three distinct categories of fertility performance emerge on inspection of these
data. First, those men who completed their
fertility prior to 1928 had on the average
2.8 children. It seems quite possible that in

obviously affected by the Depression years.
The last cohort in this category (that entering the fertile period in 1929) had
somewhat higher fertility than did the two
cohorts which entered the fertile period in
1919 and 1924, but their completed fertility
is lower than that of each cohort entering
the fertile period after 1934. That fertility
was not reduced by more than what it
apparently was is probably indicative of a
postponement of births or the result of
working with five-year cohorts.

The last three cohorts considered form
the third category of fertility performance.
Whereas each of the above two categories
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

Be

Vol. 19, No. 4

can be characterized by their homogeneity
of performance, this last category is distinguished by the fact that each successive
cohort to complete the fertile period had
on the average more children than the preceding cohort. By 1963 when the latest
cohort had completed its fertility, the men
in this group had on the average 3.66
children. This represents a 26% increase
over the fertility of the first cohort in this
category (that entering the fertile period in
1934), and a 39% increase over the fertility
of the last cohort in the second category.
This increase in fertility is probably indicative of a preference for an increased family
size among the elite population. This appears a valid assumption when we consider
that more efficient methods of contraception were probably available to later cohorts and that they were probably subject
to more liberal norms with respect to their
employment. The relatively small sample
size, particularly in the last cohort to complete its fertile period, strongly suggests
that despite the statistical significance
found caution should be observed in accepting this finding. It should be noted,
however, that even if the last cohorts are
combined the average number of children
born is over three, and that the latest
cohorts to complete what we have defined
as the fertile period are actually the cohorts
most likely to have additional children,
indicating perhaps even a conservative bias
in the estimates.

Thus, the pattern of completed elite
cohort fertility is “J shaped,” beginning at
a relatively high level (2.8), reaching a low
point (about 2.4), and then beginning a
steady climb and reaching a new high point
of about 3.6 for the last cohort examined.
It is interesting to note that this pattern
is just the opposite of the one for cohorts in
the general population (for females) (U. S.
Department of Health Education and Wel
Fertility of Elites

 

399

fare, 1960, p. 78-104). That is, if we look
at the comparable cohorts in the general
population, we find the highest average
number of children born to women in the
cohorts born before 1888 (roughly 3.31 for
cohorts comparable to those in our sample),
a steady decline in completed fertility for
those cohorts passing through their fertility
period during the Depression (reaching a
low of about 2.30), and a slight up-turn in
the post-Depression category (reaching a
high of about 2.35 for the last cohort).
If, as is often suggested, the elite group
sets the pattern of life styles which are
eventually adopted by the general population, we can expect an increase in the
average size of family among the American
population (Barber and Label, 1952; Eggan, 1963). However, it is obvious that
family size is only one aspect of life style
and that most American families cannot
afford to emulate the elite family size depicted in these data and also strive for the
more materialistic “prizes” possessed by
this group. Fallers (1954) has noted, however, that the passing down of consumption patterns has to some extent been made
possible through the increased purchasing
power of middle and lower groups. Thus,
if the purchasing power of the middle and
lower groups in society continues to rise,
it seems possible that members of these
groups, even though they have increased
control over their fertility, may attempt to
emulate the fertility of the elite.
Moreover, the data presented here, contrary to that of Kiser and Schacter (1949)
for females, indicate that the elite population is having no trouble reproducing itself. These data strongly suggest that since
the Depression elite fertility has steadily
increased. Given that this group has probably had the most knowledge about contraception and the greatest access to it, we are
led to believe that this increased fertility is
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

400 Sly and Ricards

indicative of a preference for increased
family size. The differentials studied also
indicate that elite fertility is not affected
by structural factors in the same way as
the fertility of the general population.
