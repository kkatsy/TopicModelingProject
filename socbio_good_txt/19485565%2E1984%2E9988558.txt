The Costs and Benefits
of Screening for PKU in Wisconsin

in ABSTRACT: A comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the screening program to detect newborns
owith PKU in Wisconsin is presented. Classic PKU is a genetic disorder which, if undetected and

‘untreated during the first few weeks of life, generally results in mental retardation and a variety
Sof other abnormal conditions. Monetary costs of the detection and treatment program were
=compared with the projected benefits (avoided costs) that result from the prevention of the menStal retardation associated with the disorder. Future costs and benefits were determined using a
A4 per cent, 7 per cent, and 10 per cent rate of discount. Net benefits (benefits-costs) for detecting
“and treating one individual with PKU were $208,000 ($292,000—$84,000) using the 7 per cent
Grate of discount. Net benefits for detecting four individuals with PKU per year in Wisconsin
oo ‘totaled $832,000, a large rate of return on a relatively small investment. The issue of the poten

(Barden et al., 1983; Bush et al., 1973;

3 concern over rapidly rising costs of med3 ¥ ical care increases, cost-benefit analysis
Sis increasingly accepted as one way of
= economically evaluating existing and
& projected health programs. Although

only a very small percentage (probably

less than five per cent) of current expenditures for health care 1s directed toward prevention programs, some of
these programs have the potential of
substantially reducing health costs

(Kristein, 1977). The following report

analyzes the costs and benefits of screen
ing for phenylketonuria (PKU) in Wisconsin.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) was first
identified in 1934 by Asbjorn Folling

(Felling, 1934). Felling discovered abnormal quantities of phenylpyruvic and
phenylacetic acids in the urine of mentally retarded subjects who exuded a peculiar “mousy” odor. Although phenyIketonuria was then thought to be a
single abnormality of phenylalanine metabolism, it is now clear that there are
different abnormalities involving
phenylalanine metabolism. Most of
these abnormalities are caused by mutations which reduce the activity of hepatic phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase, the
enzyme that converts phenylalanine to
tyrosine (Scriver and Clow, 1980). Recently a new group of disorders has been
identified in which phenylalanine hydroxylase is normal, but defects are
present in the metabolism of the coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which
is required for the hydroxylation of
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (Bickel, 1982; Niederwieser et al.,
1982).

Phenylalanine is an essential amino
acid for man. During early growth, a

portion of the daily intake of phenylalanine (less than 50 per cent) is used for
protein synthesis. The remainder is
mainly oxidized via the activity of
phenylalanine hydroxylase to tyrosine,
and, to a lesser extent, with the aid of
other enzymes it is changed to other metabolites such as phenylpyruvic acid,
phenylacetic acid, phenyllactic acid, and
phenylethylamine. When the hydroxylation reaction is impaired, there is an
abnormally high accumulation of
phenylalanine in fluids of the body and
the rate of metabolism of phenylalanine
along minor pathways is greatly increased. The accumulation of phenylalanine and of normal metabolites in abnormal quantities results in many of the
characteristics associated with phenylalanine disorders. Although the exact
mechanism is not clear, biochemical abnormalities associated with the accumulation of phenylalanine and its derivatives is believed to be responsible for the
irreversible arrest of differentiation of
the central nervous system that results in
the characteristic mental retardation associated with PKU (Scriver and Clow,
1980).

Mass screening of newborn infants
for hyperphenylalaninemia has led to
the realization that there is heterogeneity in mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase and in other defects of phenylalanine metabolism. In order for treatment to be specific, it is necessary to distinguish classic phenylketonuria (PKU)
from hyperphenylalaninemia variants
and other conditions associated with elevated blood levels of phenylalanine
(Levy and Mitchel, 1982). Individuals
with classic PKU are defined as those
who have very low (< 1 per cent)
phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in
the liver and generally have blood levels
of phenylalanine greater than 20 mg/100

ml (normal < 4mg/100ml) on a regular
diet. Persistent nonphenylketonuric hyperphenylalaninemia (PKU variants) is
a group of disorders manifested by less
marked decreased activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase and levels of phenylalanine in the blood which range from
4~20 mg/100 ml while on a regular diet.
Transient hyperphenylalaninemia is
rare and is characterized by elevated
phenylalanine levels in the newborn
period which progressively decline toward normal. This transient type may be
the result of a maturational delay in the
hydroxylase enzyme (Tourian and Sidbury, 1978). PKU variants, depending
on phenylalanine level, generally do not
require long-term dietary treatment, although initial treatment may be necessary until the variants can be distinguished from the classic type.
Treatment is initiated by most clinics
when blood phenylalanine levels in the
newborn period exceed 15 mg/100 ml
(Schuett et al., 1983).

Classic untreated PKU is clinically
associated with mental retardation anda
variety of other abnormal conditions including: eczema, progressive diminution of pigment, delayed psychomotor
development, seizures, hyperactivity
and other behavioral manifestations,
enamel hypoplasia, decalcification of
the long bones, and growth retardation.
(Knox, 1972; Paine, 1957; Partington,
1961). In one report the mean IQ level
of untreated individuals with classic
PKU was 40.2, with less than 4 per cent
with IQ values above 60 (Bondy and
Rosenberg, 1982). Tourian and Sidbury
(1970) estimated that ultimately 96 to 98
per cent of PKU subjects would have an
IQ less than 50, and the great majority
would require custodial care. Bush et al.
(1973) reported estimates of levels of retardation that were somewhat less se

vere, 1.e., 64 per cent of subjects had severe or profound mental retardation.
Although treatment with a low
phenylalanine diet may, when initiated
after the neonatal period, result in improvements in some of the signs and
symptoms of PKU in a minority of patients, treatment with low phenylalanine diets must commence very early in
postnatal development to prevent mental retardation (Baumeister, 1967;
vKnox, 1960, 1972). For treatment to be
einost effective, it should be begun bedore three weeks of age. Unfortunately,
a efore mass screening efforts, individgials were not identified until the deletetious effects on the brain were irreversable. During the first year of life, there
swere few specific clues that could be
“used to alert physicians to the presence
“of a PKU child.
© Because of the severity of the mental
setardation, most untreated PKU individuals require custodial care throughout their lifetimes and most are institusionalized. The life expectancy of the
‘lassic PKU individual is reduced, pregumably i in part because of the greatly
‘Increased risk of infectious disease 1n the
‘Anstitutional setting. Bondy and Rosenere (1980) reported that 75 per cent of
“patients die before age 30. Fisch et al.
-{1976) studied 1,600 PKU individuals in
206 institutions in the United States and
Greported that from 1950-76 50 per cent
died before 27 years of age. These death
by age data provided by Fisch et al.,
have been used throughout the present
cost-benefit analysis. Mass screening of
newborns throughout the United States
and successful dietary treatment of detected children has made mental retardation caused by PKU a rare occurrence.
If untreated PKU were a problem today, the life expectancy of young retarded individuals with PKU would

Costs and Benefits of PKU Screening

probably be longer than that reported
by Fisch et al., 1976). An increased lifespan would increase the benefit
(avoided cost) side of the benefit-cost
equation.

Most types of hyperphenylalaninemias, including classic PKU, are
presumably the result of an autosomal
recessive genetic defect. However, the
presence of two different mutant alleles
at the same locus or at two loci involved
in the hydroxylase reaction is nearly certainly the cause for one or more hyperphenylalaninemia variants (Bondy and
Rosneberg, 1980).

The incidence of classic PKU in the
United States is approximately 1/17,000
live births (Schuett et al., 1983). The reported incidence in other countries
ranges from 1/6,000 in Belgium and
West Germany to 1/19,000 in Israel.
The mean for nineteen countries was
approximately 1/11,800 live births
(Tourian and Sidbury, 1978). PKU is
common among Irish and Polish people,
but is rare among American blacks and
Ashkenazic Jews (Levy and Mitchell,
1982). Heterozygosity for phenylketonuria does not appear to dispose individuals to a greater frequency of mental retardation (Perry, 1965). Woolf et al.,
(1975) proposed that female heterozygote carriers of the gene may have enhanced fertility.

The law mandating expanded newborn screening in Wisconsin was enacted in 1977. PKU screening in Wisconsin began in 1966. Since the
mandated testing program was initiated
on May 16, 1978, over 300,000 infants
have been tested for phenylketonuria
(PKU) and three other disorders (galactosemia, maple syrup urine disease, and
neonatal hypothyroidism). In most
cases blood is drawn in the hospital prior
to discharge. Blood is drawn by heel

prick and placed in five spots on a standard form and sent to the State Laboratory of Hygiene for analysis.

An automated fluorometric analysis
described by Hill et al. (1965) is used to
test the concentration of phenylalanine.
If levels are greater than 4 mg/100 ml a
repeat sample is obtained and analyzed.
Studies have shown that although concentrations of blood phenylalanine are
not elevated at birth, newborn infants
show elevated levels within 24-48 hours
(Levy and Mitchell, 1982) and show
consistent increases in phenylalanine
concentrations over the first fourteen
days of age. Thus, the reliability of the
PKU screen is dramatically improved
with increasing age (McCabe et al.,
1983). Individuals with elevated levels
are referred to one of three metabolic
disease centers (Waisman Center, Madison; Milwaukee Children’s Hospital,
Milwaukee; Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield) for further analysis and, if necessary, long-term dietary treatment. In
cases where the initial blood phenylalanine level is sufficiently elevated, the
infant is immediately placed in the care
of a metabolic disease center and the
second repeat sample is obtained and
analyzed there.

The following is an effort to outline
the costs and benefits of screening for
classic phenylketonuria in Wisconsin.
The ability afforded by the screening
program of also detecting individuals
with hyperphenylalaninemia variants
and other conditions associated with elevated levels of phenylalanine is an additional, undetermined benefit of the
screening program. Although individuals with PKU variants generally do not
require long-term treatment and are not
mentally retarded, the identification of
females with a PKU variant condition is
important in regard to prevention of fu

ture problems associated with maternal
PKU (see below).

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

Cost-benefit analysis provides an estimate of the potential economic value
of a particular program, in this case
PKU screening and treatment. Monetary costs of running the detection and
treatment program are compared with
expected benefits which accrue from
early detection, treatment, and prevention of the untreated PKU. In the
present analysis, costs and benefits are
presented to determine a net benefit
value. Net benefits are derived by subtracting the costs of detecting and treating individuals with PKU from the
benefits (net benefits = benefits—costs).
Costs and benefits are presented to
reflect the cost per sample and cost per
detection of PKU; benefits represent
the avoided costs that accrue from preventing the harmful characteristics of
PKU for each detected individual. All
values are expressed in 1982 dollars.
Where 1982 figures were not available,
the most recent figures were inflated to
1982 levels by using the gross national
product deflator for each intervening
year (Statistical Abstracts of the United
States, 1981).

Because the costs of a health program which occur in the present must be
evaluated against the benefits of preventing or avoiding the costs of impairments of health that occur in the future,
cost-benefit analyses must incorporate
an appropriate discount rate to achieve
comparability between the present and
future costs. The discounting process
provides a link between present costs
and expected future benefits (Sorkin,
1975). Discounting is necessary because
a given amount of money today is worth
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

more than that same amount at some
time in the future. The difference between the present amount and the value
of that money in the future represents
the lost opportunity value of the money
involved. Assuming a 7 per cent discount rate, a $1,000 benefit that occurs in
one year’s time is worth only $935 in
terms of present value; a $935 investment today would be worth $1,000 in
one year’s time. Similarly, a $1,000
enefit that will occur in 10 years is
‘worth only $508 in terms of present
-Yalue. The present value of $Y accruing
dn 7 years in the future at a discount rate
(of 7 per cent is calculated as $Y/(1.07)°
o¢Hartunian et al., 1981). Because of discsounting, costs and benefits that occur in
cthe distant future are relatively less
‘significant i in terms of present value than
reosts and benefits that occur in the
present or near future (see Estaugh,
"4981, for a discussion of discount rates.)
= The appropriate discount rate to use
an cost-benefit analysis is a matter of
onsiderable concern. High discount
Gates give more weight to present costs
‘dhan to future benefits (avoided costs).
ow discount rates give more weight to
‘osts that must be borne by future gen“erations. A high discount rate will cause
programs with high present costs and
‘gvith benefits that occur in the future to
e less attractive economically than programs with both costs and benefits occurring in the present or near future.
Some investigators feel that the discount
rate should reflect the average rate of
growth of the gross national product,
i1.e., 3-4 per cent (Andreano and McCollum, 1983; Gramlich, 1981). Others
suggest that the discount rate should
more closely reflect the rate of inflation
or rate of interest that could be obtained
from a high quality bond or other private sector investment, i.e., 7-10 per

cent. In some cost-benefit analyses several discount rates may be used and the
decision concerning which rate is appropriate for evaluation of a particular program is left to the policymaker. In the
present study, discount rates of 4 per
cent, 7 per cent, and 10 per cent were
calculated. Tables and narrative use the
7 per cent rate. Notations of values associated with the other discount rates appear as footnotes of the relevant tables.

An important issue concerning costs
and benefits of preventing a genetic disorder is that of reproductive “compensation” or “replacement.” In the case of
genetic disorders that are prevented by
termination of pregnancy, the projected
lifetime costs of an individual with a disorder such as Down’s syndrome can be
viewed to be influenced by whether or
not the affected fetus is “replaced” by
an infant with a normal genotype
(Hook, 1979). Andreano and McCollum (1983) concluded that the replacement case was not a relevant consideration when determining the gross
benefits of an amniocentesis program.
However, in calculations concerning
PKU, the abnormal PKU child is essentially “‘replaced” by a normal one as a
result of early detection and successful
dietary treatment. Therefore, in calculating benefits (avoided costs) of PKU
screening the costs of care and education of a normal person were subtracted
from the costs of care and special education of the untreated PKU individual.
Special education costs were calculated
as additional costs beyond the normal
costs of education. Normal consumption costs were subtracted from the special costs of residential care and services
required by a mentally retarded individual. Similarly, the difference between
the earnings of an average normal individual and the expected earnings of an

individual with untreated PKU constitutes lost productivity and is included as
a benefit when the ‘‘replacement” situation applies (Hook, 1979). Lost productivity amounted to a significant portion
of the total benefits that resulted from
the PKU screening program.

PROGRAM COSTS

The costs of a program designed to
prevent the overt manifestations of
phenylketonuria included the cost of
screening and detection and the subsequent costs of long-term treatment of
those detected. Screening and detection
costs included the costs related to the
collection of the blood specimen and the
costs incurred for laboratory testing.
Because the specimen was collected
while the mother and baby were in the
hospital following birth, no additional
costs related to transportation to the
hospital, foregone earnings of the
mother, and child care were included
(Stoddart, 1982). Treatment costs for
individuals with PKU included the cost
for the required low phenylalanine dietary supplement and costs related to frequent blood tests, physician fees, and
nutritional consultations.

COLLECTION COSTS

The actual costs involved in collecting the specimen in the hospital were estimated to be approximately $4.60 per
collection. This cost was determined by
a time study at three Madison, Wisconsin, hospitals. Costs included estimated
costs for drawing blood, administration
costs, medical record costs, supplies,
billing costs, and overhead. Estimates
for the three hospitals were $4.11,
$4.54, and $4.60. Similar estimates from
other Wisconsin hospitals could be
more, or less, than those above. Be

cause this one collection provided blood
specimens for four screening tests, the
cost for the PKU portion was $1.15
($4.60/4).

LABORATORY COSTS

Laboratory costs for testing for PKU
were estimated to be $1.34 per sample
(Table 1). This cost included personnel
salaries, supplies and expenses, and
overhead. The laboratory costs have
been divided among the four test procedures according to the personnel commitment of time (FTE) and cost of supplies associated with each particular
test.

When an initial test for phenylalanine
is elevated, a recall test must be done to
verify the initial finding. The cost per recall was estimated to be $40.00, and included a $10.00 charge for the PKU test,
$10.00 for travel expenses, and a $20.00
clinic charge. The recall rate in Wisconsin was estimated to be less than 0.1%
(170/300,000 investigated samples). The
recall cost per initial sample tested was
thus $0.04 (0.001 x $40.00).

The sum of the collecting and testing
costs was the cost of processing each
sample. This cost was estimated to be
$2.53 ($1.15 + $1.34 + $0.04) for the
period July 1, 1981 through June 30,

1982. The cost of detecting a case of
PKU is related to the incidence of PRU
in Wisconsin. The average incidence of
PKU (classic type) for the years 1978-82
was approximately 1/17,000 (Table 2).
The cost for detecting each case of PKU
was thus approximately $43,000
(17,000 x $2.53) (Table 10).

Treatment costs included a number

During the period 1978 through 1982 approximately 295,000 individuals were tested.

etary supplement would be discontinued before twenty years. However, because of the present uncertainty
concerning how long the dietary supplements should be continued to maintain
optimal development, a lengthy, conservative time span was utilized. A recent survey indicated that 64 per cent of
ninety United States clinics recommended an indefinite diet for males; 72
per cent of these same clinics recommended an indefinite diet for females
(Schuett et al., 1983).

Treatment costs for a twenty-year
period, discounted at 7 per cent, were
estimated to be approximately $40,830
(Table 3). Treatment costs included expenditures for the low phenylalanine dietary supplements and additional expenses related to the need for frequent
blood analyses, travel expenses related
to periodic evaluation, and fees for physicians, nutritionists, and genetic counselors. These treatment costs were assessed at a university-affiliated research
facility (Waisman Center, Madison) and
may be somewhat higher than those incurred at other treatment centers. The
combined costs for the detection and
treatment for each individual with classic PKU was estimated to be approximately $84,000 (Table 10).

BENEFITS

The benefits that result from the detection and successful treatment of an
individual with PKU are represented by
the total cost of the disease (untreated
PKU). These costs generally comprise
three elements: (1) expenditures related
to the lifelong care of an individual with
untreated PKU; (2) loss of productivity
resulting from premature death or disability; (3) the pain, suffering, and emotional deprivation associated with the

disease (Sorkin, 1975). This latter cost is
difficult to express in monetary terms,
but its social value should not be forgotten when evaluating any prevention program. Large unmeasured social benefits
should be as important as cost savings in
the determination of the fate of a proposed program. Benefits which can
more readily be expressed in monetary
terms include: cost of institutional care,
cost of foster care, cost of adult residential care and services, cost of special education, lost productivity of the affected
individual, and lost productivity of the
mother.

The avoided costs of institutional and
residential care and services for an individual with PKU represent a major
component of the benefits associated
with a successful PKU detection program. In order to accurately estimate
these costs over the lifetime of an individual, one must take into account the
relatively high mortality experienced by
individuals with PKU in the institutional
setting. Unfortunately, good life tables
for PKU individuals are not available.
For the purpose of this report, survival
rates were derived from a study of the
age at death for institutionalized PKU
individuals (Fisch et al., 1976). These
figures reflect past mortality rates and

 

probably do not reflect the improved life
expectancy that might be expected from
improvements in medical knowledge at
the present time and in the future. Improvements in lifespan would increase
the benefits in a cost benefit analysis.

Estimated level of mental retardation
must also be considered when determining benefits (avoided costs). For the
present analysis, the estimated percentage of individuals with PKU with severe
or profound mental retardation was 64
per cent; 36 per cent of PKU individuals
were placed in the moderately to mildly
mentally retarded category. These estimates follow the judgement of nationally recognized PKU authorities (Bush
et al., 1973). Other investigators have
placed the estimate of the percentage of
individuals with severe or profound
mental retardation at considerably
higher levels (Bondy and Rosenberg,
1980). The levels used in the present
study should be considered conservative. The level of retardation expected is
important when estimating the percentage of PKU individuals who would require institutional care, foster care, and
ultimately adult residential care and
services. Special education costs also
vary according to the level of mental retardation.

INSTITUTIONAL CARE

In 1982 the cost of institutional care
at the Wisconsin Center for Developmental Disabilities was $36,500/year.
From this figure, $4,000 was deducted to
reflect the personal consumption costs
which would have been spent by the
family if the child were not institutionalized (Sorkin, 1975). This consumption
cost was estimated from figures pre‘sented for a family of four and included
he estimated cost of food, housing,
¥lothing, medical care, and other necesSities (Statistical Abstracts of the United
States, 1981). In the present analysis it
owas assumed that institutional care
would not begin until age five. The longterm cost of institutional care for one
PKU individual, incorporating the esti-mated rates of survival for each age in¥erval, was estimated to be approxi‘Rately $259,000, with costs discounted

‘at 7 per cent (Table 4).

personal consumption costs). The discounted cost of foster care was estimated to be approximately $32,000 for
the years of age five to twenty (Table 5).
Annual costs of adult residential care
and services were estimated to be
$12,000. This figure admittedly is a
rough estimate. There was a wide range
of costs for individual situations. The average cost for adult nursing home care in
Wisconsin ranged from $30-$85 per
day, with community services providing
many of the services not provided in the
nursing homes in the lower range of
cost. Residential services provided by
group homes for the mentally retarded
were determined to be in the $10,000$20,000 range, not including the costs
for associated services in the community
such as special transportation, vocational rehabilitation, and controlled
workplaces. The total adult residential
care and services cost for PKU individuals was estimated to be $20,000 over
the lifetime of the individual (Table 5).
This figure was relatively small because
of the low average survival rates of individuals with PKU and because of the effect of discounting.

SUMMARY OF BENEFITS (AVOIDED COSTS)
OF INSTITUTIONAL CARE, FOSTER CARE
AND ADULT CARE AND SERVICES

The total benefits (avoided costs) related to institutional and residential care
and services for one PKU individual are
presented in Table 9. Under Option I, it
was assumed that 64 per cent of PKU
subjects would be profoundly or severely retarded and that they would require institutionalization from age five
for life. Thirty-six per cent of subjects
were assumed to be moderately or
mildly retarded. Of these, one-half (18
per cent of total) would require foster
care from age five to twenty. All 36 per
cent were assumed to require adult care
and services from age twenty for life.
The total discounted cost for residential
care and services per PKU individual
amounted to approximately $179,000
Under a somewhat altered set of assumptions concerning the estimates of
percentages of individuals requiring different levels of care (Option II), the
costs were estimated to be $111,000 (Table 9).

SPECIAL EDUCATION

The cost of special education 1s another benefit (avoided cost) of a program that detects and successfully treats
PKU individuals. Costs of special education represent costs in excess of the
costs of providing a normal education.
The added costs of special education
were determined for individuals with severe (SMR), moderate (TMR), and
mild (EMR) levels of retardation, utilizing figures from a nationwide study of
costs of special education (Kakalik et
al., 1981). Similar figures were not available in Wisconsin. The total cost of special education, utilizing estimated rates
of survival and the 7 per cent discount
rate, was approximately $42,000 for the
severely mentally retarded, $37,000 for
the moderately mentally retarded, and
$22,000 for the mildly mentally retarded
(Table 6). Based on the predicted levels
of mental retardation for untreated
PKU individuals, the total cost of special education was determined to be approximately $38,000 per PKU individual (Table 9).

MATERNAL INCOME

When a child with mental retardation
becomes a new member of a family, often a portion of that family’s potential
income is foregone. This loss will be referred to as lost maternal income. For
he purposes of the present analysis, it
° was assumed that one-half of mothers
who would normally seek and find employment if their child were normal
would choose not to become employed
if their child were mentally retarded
(Andreano and McCollum, 1983.) Statistics have shown that 45 per cent of
mothers work if their child of birth to six
years of age is normal (Statistical Abstracts of the United States, 1981). Following the above assumption, 22.5 per
cent (one-half of 45 per cent) of mothers
with a mentally retarded child would
forego their earnings for children in the
birth to six-year age bracket. Thirty-one
per cent (one-half of 62 per cent) forego
earnings for children aged six to eight

The discounted lost maternal income
for mothers with PKU children from
birth to age twenty was approximately
$31,000. This figure took into account
the expected percentage of working
mothers in each age bracket and the estimated survival rate of a PKU child (Table 7). Finally, these figures were adjusted to include only mothers of
noninstitutionalized mentally retarded
individuals. For both Option I and II,
maternal income would be lost from age
zero to five years for 100 per cent of subjects and from five to twenty years for 18
per cent of subjects. Total lost maternal
income over the twenty year period was
estimated to be approximately $15,000
per PKU child (Table 9).

“Lifetime productivity figures were denved from Conley, (1973) and brought to 1982 levels by applying the annual per cent
changes 1n wage rates for the period from 1971-81 ( Stanstical Abstracts of the United States, 1981) Conley’s figures were based on

the following assumptions

(a) Earnings of mildly retarded were comparable to the earnings of the general population to age 25 Thereafter, earnings

decline to 86 per cent of normal for males and 87 per cent of normal for females

(b) Earnings of moderately retarded workers were 20 per cent of normal

(c) Employment rates for mildly retarded workers were the same as for the general population up to the age of 25 Thereafter

they were 4 per cent below average for males and 12 per cent below average for females

(d) Employment rates among moderately retarded workers were 45 per cent of normal for males and 12 per cent of normal

rates for females

(e) Mortality rates were 25 per cent above normal for mildly retarded subyects and 75 per cent above normal for moderately

retarded subjects,

(f) The value of unpatd work was 25 per cent of gross earnings for men and 37 5 per cent of gross earnings for women The

unpaid productinty for women mainly represented homemaking services

The value of the estimated lifetime productivity of workers was derived from
Conley (1973). 1982 values were determined by applying annual per cent

of a normal male was estimated to be
$117,100, compared to $11,390 for the
productivity of a moderately retarded
worker. In this case the lost lifetime productivity was estimated to be $105,710.
For females the comparable figure was
$33,230. Using the estimate that 82 per
cent of PKU individuals would be moderately to profoundly mentally retarded
and that 18 per cent would be mildly retarded, the lost lifetime earnings
amounted to $60,000 (Table 9).

SUMMARY OF
BENEFITS — COSTS

The net (benefits — costs) of
detecting and successfully treating one
case of PKU are presented in Table 10.
Under Option I the net benefits
amounted to $208,610; net benefits under Option II amounted to $140,170. In
Wisconsin the annual savings that result
from detecting four individuals with
PKU were $832,000 under Option I and
approximately $560,000 under the assumptions of Option II. Therefore, in
regard to the PKU prevention program,
relatively modest program costs were
greatly offset by the estimated benefits
of avoiding the serious consequences of
the failure to detect and treat this genetic disorder. However, in order to
fully benefit from the investment in a

successful PKU detection and treatment
program, problems associated with reproduction by women with treated PKU
and with untreated hyperphenylalaninemia must be understood.

MATERNAL PKU

Maternal phenylketonuria (mPKU)
is a problem that could, in the future,
significantly alter the favorable benefitcost figures outlined above. Maternal
phenylketonuria is a condition which
generally results in significant mortality
and morbidity in the offspring of mothers with PKU/hyperphenylalaninemia
who were not on a phenylalanine restricted diet prior to and during pregnancy. Microcephaly, mental retardation, cardiac anomalies, and

among the most frequently reported ofa
variety of congenital anomalies which
almost invariably occur in nonphenylketonuric offspring of mothers with elevated blood levels of phenylalanine.
Heterozygous mothers have only minimal elevations of blood phenylalanine
and generally have normal offspring
(Howell and Stevenson, 1971; Lenke
and Levy, 1980; Mabry et al., 1966). Although some phenylketonuric mothers
who had a restricted intake of phenylalanine commencing either before or during early pregnancy have had apparently
normal offspring; others have been less
successful (Davidson et al., 1981;
Komrower et al., 1979; Lenke and
Levy, 1982; Nielsen et al., 1979). Not
enough data are available to indicate
whether the developing fetus can be totally protected by maternal dietary therapy. What is clear is that the added cost
of dietary treatment and care of the

Social Biology

woman with PKU during pregnancy
would be relatively small when compared to the long-term costs related to
the care of a defective child. Close followup and genetic counseling of women
with hyperphenylalaninemia should be
a major priority of programs which have
so successfully detected and treated individuals with PKU.
