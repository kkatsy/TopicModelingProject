ABSTRACT: Iran has the second highest age differential between husband and wife out of 55
countries studied (Dixon, 1971) and one almost twice as large as that for all countries combined.
This article provides a set of basic reliable data on husband-wife age differentials in Shiraz, Iran,
for marriages in 1956, 1966, 1973, and 1974, and for divorces in 1956, 1966, and 1973. The data
provide support for the hypotheses: (1) the larger the difference between the ages of bride and
groom, the higher the chance for family dissolution; and (2) the younger the brides, the greater the

age differences between them and their grooms.

With regard to the physiological differences between men and women, it is generally thought that males reach their peak
of sexual activity at an earlier age than
females. From the point of view of sexual
compatibility, a factor which affects marital stability, a man therefore should theoretically marry an older woman. However, in almost all societies the average age
of grooms is higher than the average age of
their brides. The difference ranges from
an average of less than two years in some
nations to close to ten years in others.

Dixon (1971) using Hajnal’s (1953) singulate mean age at marriage calculated the
husband-wife age difference in 55 Middle
Eastern, Asian, English-speaking, and
European countries. In 15 (27.3 per cent)
of these countries, the average difference
was less than three years; in 22 (40.5 per
cent) of them, the gap was three or more
but less than four years; in 6 (10.9 per
cent), it was four or more but less than five
years; and, in 12 (21.8 per cent) countries,
the gap between the average age of grooms
and their brides was five or more years.
Thus, in 78.2 per cent of the countries the
difference was less than five years.

Dixon (1971) found grooms to be older
than their brides in all societies examined,
with an average difference ranging from
1.9 years in Yugoslavia to 9 years in
Libya. Dixon (1971, p. 216) hypothesizes:
“In general, the younger the brides, the
greater is the age difference between them
and their grooms.” According to Dixon
(1971), the Middle Eastern grooms are on
the average 5.3 years older than their
brides; Asian grooms, 4.7 years older;
Eastern European grooms, 2.9 years
older; and grooms in the English-speaking
nations, 2.7 years older. The average was
3.8 years for all 55 countries examined.

A close examination of the available
data shows that only in a very few countries in the world is the average gap more
than 6 years. Libya with a difference of 9
years and Iran with close to 7 years occupy
the highest positions in the world. According to calculations made by Dixon (1971),
the age difference for Iran in 1956 was 6.5
years, the second highest among the 55
countries studied. Thus, the age gap in
Iran is about twice as large as that for the
world as a whole.

When discussing the causes of divorce,

341

social scientists attribute variation in divorce to such factors as age at marriage,
race, social and population mobility, level
of education, previous marital status of
the man and the woman, the employeeworker ratio in the labor force, proportion
urban population, the ratio of children to
adult males, and a number of other variables (Mazur, 1969; Leslie, 1967; Rosenwaike, 1969; Bumpass and Sweet, 1972;
Glick, 1957; Heiss, 1972; and, Weed,
1974). Of the aforementioned variables,
age at marriage, or more specifically the
proportion of teenage marriages, is shown
to be a good predictor of divorce. Very
little, however, is known about the effects
of husband-wife age differentials on this
social problem.

Although Iran is one of the very few
countries in the world with a large gap
between the age of the grooms and their
brides, there is very little reliable information on this phenomenon and its social
consequences. Thus, one of the objectives
of this study is to provide a set of basic
reliable data relative to husband-wife age
differentials in Iran. A second objective is
to provide empirical evidence in support
of the following hypotheses: (a) the larger
the difference between the ages of the
grooms and their brides, the higher the
chances for family dissolution; and, (b) the
younger the brides, the greater is the age
difference between them and their
grooms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study utilizes three sets of data.
The primary data consist of information
for the Iranian years 1335, 1345, and 1352
(approximately 1956, 1966, and 1973) obtained from marriage contracts and divorce certificates issued in the city of
Shiraz, the sixth largest city in Iran.

The Iranian year begins on March 21 or
22, so that the year 1335 would correspond

Momeni

Social Biology

to the period between March 21, 1956 and
March 20, 1957. The Iranian solar year
(SY) may be converted to the year of the
Christian era (YCE) by the formula: SY +
621 = YCE.

Located in the southern part of Iran,
Shiraz increased in population from
170,659 in 1956 to 269,865 in 1966, an
annual growth rate of 4.58 per cent. At
this growth rate, the population of Shiraz
was estimated at 410,000 in 1975. The
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population of Shiraz are
very similar to those of other large Iranian
cities, so that the findings relative to
Shiraz may well hold true for other cities
in Iran.

The documents utilized are available at
special bureaus called Mahzars where the
registration of marriages and divorces take
place. The records kept at the Mahzars as
yet constitute the best source of information relative to nuptiality in Iran. The
years 1956 and 1966 were chosen because
during these years the first and second
nationwide censuses of Iran were taken,
and thus other demographic characteristics of the population are available for
comparative purposes. The year 1973 was
chosen because it constituted the last
completed year of registered marriages
and divorces.

The second set of data consists of random interviews of four hundred newly
married couples in Shiraz in 1974. The
third set of data was obtained from a
sample of 446 couples who applied to the
Shiraz Health Department for premarital
blood tests in 1974. Almost all couples
applying for premarital blood tests marry
within seven days after the test as the certificates are valid for seven days only.

It should be pointed out that this study
compares marriages of certain years with
divorces of the same years. Since these are
two independent series of events, it would
have been more appropriate to compare,

Vol. 23, No. 4

say, the divorces of 1956 with marriages of
the years when the 1956 divorce cohort
were married. Needless to say, such data
do not exist. But since it is believed that
there has been very little change in the
husband-wife age differentials during the
time difference between the two independent series, no great errors are expected to
result from comparing the two independent series.

It should also be pointed out that prior
to 1967 only men had the right to seek
divorce. In 1967, the Family Protection
Law abolished the males’ right to repudiate their wives unilaterally. Women
also gained equal rights to initiate divorce
preceedings on certain specified grounds,
such as impotence, adultery, insanity,
failure of husband to maintain her, illtreatment, husband’s imprisonment for
five years or more, addiction of husband,
when a man marries a second wife, and
when he behaves in a manner damaging to
the honor and prestige of the family.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to go
into details concerning the divorce laws,
reasons for divorce, chances for remarriage, and the inheritance and the property holding laws in Iran. It may, however, be of interest that the remarriage
rate in Iran is quite low and that both

married and divorced women can own
and operate their own properties.

RESULTS

The basic results of this study are displayed in Table 1, showing the distribution of husband-wife age differentials for
all those marrying in Shiraz in the years
1956, 1966, 1973, and 1974; and for those
divorcing in 1956, 1966, and 1973. In most
countries in the world, the average groom
is a little over three years older than his
bride. Based on this universal experience,
it may be argued that gaps of five or more
years are undesirable. In view of this arbitrarily defined acceptable age difference,
an examination of Table 1 shows that only
a small proportion of Shirazi marriages
may be considered acceptable. In only
21.6 per cent of marriages in 1956, 18.0
per cent of marriages in 1966, and in 29.6
per cent of marriages in 1973 were the
husbands four or fewer years older than
their brides. For the majority of the marriages, the difference was more than five
years.

and wife in Shiraz for the four time periods. Since the variations in the mean age
at marriage during the years 1956, 1966,
and 1974 are not significantly different, it
is difficult to make a definitive statement
about the trend in the mean age at marriage in Shiraz between 1956 and 1974.
However, the slight decline in the mean
age at marriage between 1956 and 1966 is
not unique to Iran. Several other nations
have also experienced a similar decline
(Momeni, 1975c, pp. 25-27) during the
same period. Easterlin (1967, 1968), has
linked the decline in the age at marriage to
the economic cycle. Economic prosperity
may lead to a temporary increase in the
number of marriages and a decline in the
average age at first marriage.

The rate of economic growth in Iran in
the past decade or so has been one of the
highest in the world. The observed decline

in the average age at marriage in Shiraz
could be partly explained as a response to
rapid economic development and _ increased prosperity in Iran. This declining
trend is not expected to continue for long,
however. As the country passes through
the transitional stage from developing toa
developed phase, a variety of socioeconomic and demographic changes, such as
increased income and level of education,
increased urbanization, and females’
nonagricultural labor force participation
are expected to influence the age at marriage to change its course and assume an
upward trend.

Indeed, this upward trend can already
be detected in Shiraz, because the decline
in the average age from 21.1 in 1956 to
20.0 in 1966 is followed by an increase to
20.3 in 1973. The increased peakedness in
the age at marriage distribution in 1973 as

compared with those of 1956 and 1966 is
not incidental, however. The 1967 Family
Protection Law played the major role in
changing the age at marriage schedule.
Prior to 1967 (i.e., in 1956 and 1966), a
law enacted in 1935 concerning a minimum age at marriage (age 16 for girls) was
hardly enforced. But as a result of the new
Family Protection Law, the law was
strongly enforced, and a number of
under-age marriages were prevented.
However, those who could not marry before reaching the legal age usually married
immediately after they reached the legal
age.

From an examination of Tables 2 and 3,
the following observations may be made:
(1) The husband-wife age differential in
Shiraz is one of the highest in the world.
(2) The mean age difference at marriage
ranged between a low of 6.4 years in 1974
to a high of 9.3 years in 1966. (3) There is a
declining trend in husband-wife age differentials between 1956 and 1974. The
mean difference declined from 8.4 years in
1956 and 9.3 years in 1966 to 7.3 years in
1973, and to 7.2 and 6.4 years in 1974 on
the basis of the interview and the blood
test data, respectively. An examination of
the modal and the median gaps will lead
us to the same observations. (4) The
husband-wife age differential for those divorcing in Shiraz (Momeni, 1975c) is
larger than the differential between the
ages of those marrying.

In spite of the observed declining trend
in husband-wife age differentials in the
past two decades or so, next to Libya Iran
still has the highest husband-wife age differential in the world. Because of its detrimental effects on the marital relationship, any change toward narrowing the
difference between the age of husband and
wife is considered desirable. In order to
see clearly what is happening to the gap in
age between an average man and woman
marrying in Shiraz, let us further examine

Husband-wife Age Differentials in Iran

345

the distributions of husband-wife age diiferentials.

STRUCTURE OF HUSBAND-WIFE AGE
DIFFERENTIALS

The mean, modal, and median
husband-wife age differentials are probably the most frequently used summary
statistics for the frequency distribution of
age differences. But to have a complete
picture about the characteristics of a distribution, further analysis is necessary. A
number of measures may be used to describe a distribution. Standard deviation,
measures of skewness, peakedness (kurtosis) and the coefficient of variation (a
measure of spread of the distribution) are
of interest.

Table 4 shows the values of standard
deviation, s, a> ( a measure of skewness
based on the third moment around the
mean), a* (a measure of kurtosis or
peakedness which is based on the fourth
moment around the mean), and the coefficient of variation. Mathematically expressed: a? = m3/s3, where m3? = & (X; —
Mean)?/N, the third moment about the
mean, and s is the standard deviation.
Then, a* = m4/s*, where, m‘ is the fourth
moment about the mean.

The values for the distribution of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

346

husband-wife age differentials for Shiraz
indicate significant departure from normality, due to the large values of s, the
skewness, and the peakedness (leptokurtosis) of the distributions. Relative to
marriages based on the above measures,
the 1973 distribution is more skewed and
peaked than either the 1956 or the 1966
distributions, indicating a major shift in
the husband-wife age differentials between 1956 and 1973. Relative to skewness, as measured by a, all three distributions are positively skewed. But there
is little difference between the skewness as
well as the spread (coefficient of variation)
of the 1956 distribution compared with the
1973 distribution.

As a whole, the 1973 distribution is
markedly different from the 1956 and the
1966 distributions. The 1973 distribution
has the lowest value for s, but the highest
values for a? and a*. The 1966 distribution
has the lowest value for peakedness indicating that a smaller proportion of the age
differences conform to the typical (mean)
age gap between the marrying persons.

The increased peakedness of the
husband-wife age differentials distributions from 1956 to 1973 indicates that the
mean differential has fallen, but at the
same time the concentration of age differentials around this mean differential has
increased. In spite of the fact that there
has been a persistence of some marriages
with large age differences (that is, distant
from the average), the trend toward a
smaller gap is associated with an increase
in conformity in the typical husband-wife
age differential.

This tendency of more and more
marriages to conform to the typical
husband-wife age difference is also evident from the value of the standard deviation of the distributions as shown in Table
4. It may be noted that in 1973 when the
value of peakedness was the highest,.the
value of s was the lowest, indicating a

 

Momeni

Social Biology

lesser degree of variability or deviation
from the typical gap. In other words, an
increase in peakedness means concentration of observations (husband-wife age
gap in this case) in the center of the distribution or one standard deviation away
from the mean gap.

TEST OF HYPOTHESES

In the introductory section of this paper
it was stated that the second objective of
this study was to test two hypotheses: (a)
the larger the gap between the age of the
grooms and their brides, the higher the
chances for family dissolution; (6) the
younger the brides, the greater is the age
difference between them and. their
grooms. This section deals with testing
these hypotheses.

Large age gap/marital instability.—It
has been demonstrated that the mean difference between the ages of marrying individuals included in this study was smaller than the mean difference between the
ages of those divorcing. This fact is also
evident from Table 1, which shows that
the proportion of divorcing couples with
husband-wife age differentials of 15 years
or more is much higher than the corresponding proportions for those marrying,
especially those marrying in 1973 and
1974. For example, while 20.6 to 22.6 per
cent of the couples divorcing had an age
difference of 15 years or more, only 11.0
per cent of couples marrying in 1973, 8.2
per cent of couples interviewed in 1974,
and 8.3 per cent of couples applying for
premarital blood tests had an age difference of 15 years or more. That is, the
proportion of couples divorcing in 1973
with 15 or more years age difference was
about twice as great as the proportion of
persons with an age difference of 15 or
more years marrying in 1973 and 2.5 times
greater than the proportion of those with
an age gap of 15+ years marrying in 1974.

This finding would seem to offer evidence
in support of our hypothesis.

Lower average age of brides/larger age
gaps.—The examination of the difference
between the median age of grooms and
brides in a random sample of ten countries
with a median age of brides of 20 or above
revealed an average age difference of 2.9
years, while in a sample of countries with
the median age of brides below 20, the gap
was 6.6 years. That is, lower median age
of brides was found to be associated with
larger husband-wife age differentials. In
Libya, Iran, Morocco, Egypt, Tunesia,
Algeria, Iraq, India, Pakistan, Ceylon,
Singapore, and Hong Kong where the
mean husband-wife age differential is five
or more years, the average age of brides
was found to be 19.2 years. In thirty countries, not listed here, with the average
husband-wife age differential between 3
and 4.9 years, the average age of brides
was found to be 21.9 years, while in fifteen
countries with an average age difference of
less than three years, the average age of
brides was found to be 23.0 years. These
findings support the hypothesis that the
lower the average age of brides, the larger
the gap between the age of husband and
wife.

Treating the average age of brides as the
independent variable and the husbandwife age gap for sixty countries as the dependent variable, the simple correlation
coefficient, 7, was found to be — 0.74. The
large negative value of r provides strong
empirical support in favor of our hypothesis. The data for Shiraz provide additional evidence regarding the inverse relation between the average age of brides and
the husbnad-wife age differentials. In
1966 when the average age of brides was
the lowest, the husband-wife age differential was the highest.

There are several reasons for the wide
gap between the ages of husband and wife
in Iran. As this hypothesis explains, early

female age at marriage contributes to this
wide gap. In Iran, most marriages are arranged; virginity is one of the transcenden
tal values (Momeni, 1972); younger girls
are preferred; and a man is economically,

socially, and morally responsible for his
wife. Most males have to finish their military service and not only attain economic
independence (i.e., have jobs and regular
income) but also have sufficient savings
and/or property to he able to pay a dower
before they can marry. These and other
social structural and institutional mechanisms promote child and early marriage of
females and relatively late age at marriage’
(26 years) for males. The combination of
early female and late male age at marriage
results in wide husband-wife age differentials,

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Using three sets of data relative to four
different periods in time, the distributions
of the husband-wife age differentials for
those marrying and divorcing in Shiraz are
examined. The standard deviation, coefficient of variation, mean, and measures of
skewness and peakedness of the distributions are calculated. Two hypotheses
relative to the relationship between
husband-wife age gap/marital instability
and the average age of brides/husbandwife age gaps are tested.

It is concluded that: (1) The husbandwife age differential in Iran is one of the
highest in the world. (2) This large gap
between the age of husband and wife contributes to marital instability in Shiraz. (3)
The marriage of girls at an early age contributes to the large difference between the
age of husband and wife. (4) The gap has
narrowed between 1966 and 1974, and
this trend is expected to continue in the
future.

In an effort to curb population growth
and improve the health of women, Iran
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

348

has since 1967 been enforcing a law setting
the minimum age at marriage for girls at
16. A recent law has now raised the minimum marriage age to 18 for girls and to 20
for boys. Although we are somewhat
doubtful about the population control consequences of this law, we are quite certain
that it has great health consequences in
preventing a large number of child marriages.

Not much study has been done on the
health consequences of husband-wife age
differentials. But it is almost a truism that
very large gaps between the age of hus

band and wife, as is the case in Iran, are
deterimental to the health and the stability
of the families involved.

As a closing statement, it must be
pointed out that this paper is only an
exploratory study. Further research of this
problem, especially its demographic,
health, and social-psychological consequences, is needed.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
