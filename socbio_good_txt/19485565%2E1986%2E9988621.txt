ABSTRACT: A model of fertility determination is presented in which current fertility is a nonlinear function of the fertility of previous generations. This model seems to be an adequate representation of post-war fertility in Canada and forecasts a renewal of fertility in the 1980’s and
1990’s. It would seem that policy decisions based on the unchallenged assumption of a continu
ance of low fertility may be ill-advised.

The post-war decline in Canadian
fertility—from a total fertility rate of
3.947 in 1959 to 1.704 in 1981—has been
well documented (Henripin and Legare, 1971; Murphy and Nagnur, 1972;
Legare, 1974; Grindstaff, 1975; Collinshaw, 1976; Statistics Canada, 1979).
The decline is generally attributed to
two main factors: (1) the spread and increasing effectiveness of contraception;
and (2) the fundamental change in women’s role in society. But whatever the
reasons for the decline in fertility, it is a
commonly held belief that the trend will
continue (Grindstaff, 1975; LaVoie,
1979; Statistics Canada, 1979). LaVoie
concludes that it is “now increasingly
obvious that migration may replace natural increase as the most important factor in determining future population
growth.”

But is it perfectly clear that current
economic and social developments will
persist and fertility will, of necessity,
continue to decline? It is not.

Several years ago Richard Easterlin
(1961, 1968, 1973) developed a model of
fertility based on the correspondence
between movements in the age structure
of the labor force and the fertility rate.

51

As the ratio of younger to older workers
falls, the former perform better in the labor market than expected and their income rises relative to that which they expected. Members of a relatively smaller
cohort marry earlier, in greater numbers, and have higher fertility rates than
would larger cohorts, for whom the labor market experience is worse than
their expectations. Easterlin and Condran (1976) applied the model to Canada and found a “rough correspondence
between the movement in the age ratio
and the fertility rate,”’ although, compared to the U.S. and Australia, “the
amplitude of the fertility movement is
greater, with the fertility down turn especially being more pronounced.” They
concluded that “if this mechanism really
is Operative, then it implies a continuation of the current fertility decline
through 1980. At that point, the fertility
decline in progress since 1960 would
start to have its effect on the age ratio
and presumably set in motion a replication of the 1940-1980 pattern.”

Thus, Easterlin and Condran suggest
the possibility that Canadian fertility is
dictated by a relative cohort size (or relative income) model of fertility which

points to a resurgence of fertility in the
next two decades rather than a decline.
Samuelson (1976) has recently formalized Easterlin’s model and shown that if
the Easterlin effect is sufficiently strong,
cycles in fertility will result.! Ahlburg
(1983) demonstrated that this model fits
the U.S. post-war fertility data very well
and predicts the revival of fertility in the
1980’s and 1990’s. This model will now
be applied to Canadian data as a check
on Easterlin and Condran’s earlier analysis and to see whether the model also
predicts a revival of Canadian fertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The basic elements of the model are
as follows. Increases in the size of a birth
cohort relative to preceding cohorts reduce that cohort’s income relative to
that of smaller cohorts and consequently
reduce the fertility of the large cohort.
In this manner, the size of a particular
cohort is a function of the size of previous birth cohorts.

This system can formally be shown to
reduce to (see Samuelson, 1976, and
Ahlburg, 1983)

(1) a = 4,[By_1)/By_2)]
1~1) + 9, Bux)
where B, = births in year ¢ and the lags
represent generations not years.

The model assumes that immigration

is zero, Or, at least, relatively small.

‘Denton and Spencer (1975, Chap. 3) also investigated the properties of an economicdemographic forecasting model incorporating an
“Fasterlin effect.” Fertility was specified as a function of the male wage rate that would be obtained
if the model were in a stationary state. Simulations
with the model produced regular, selfperpetuating cycles when the elasticity of fertility
rates with respect to wage rates was somewhat
greater than 2. Although the cycles were somewhat longer than those predicted by Easterlin,
their work is basically consistent with the model
presented here.

Social Biology

However, immigration has been an important, though highly variable, source
of population growth in Canada. It contributed 5, 25, and 22 per cent of population growth in 1941-51, 1951-61 and
1961-71, respectively. Over the most recent period, 1971-76, it contributed
about one-third of population growth
(Denton et al., 1980.) However, emigration has also been significant in Canada; net emigration rates were 0.9, 6.7,
and 3.6 per thousand in 1941-51, 195161, and 1961-71. For both emigration
and immigration, about 25 per cent
were females in the prime childbearing
years 20-39 (Denton et al., 1980).

From these statistics, it does not appear that immigration or emigration was
sufficiently large to alter significantly the
age-structure of the population. In addition, foreign-born women have much
lower fertility than native-born women,
particularly among post-war immigrants
(Collishaw, 1976; Balakrishnan et al.,
1979). Consequently, the model outlined above may be a useful approximation to the Canadian experience.

ESTIMATION OF THE MODEL

Equation (1) may be written as:

(2) B, = a, BF+ a, B,_» + &,
where B, = total live births.

Br = (B,_;)°/ B,-y
and €, = random disturbance term.

The lags t—1 and t-2 are twenty and
forty years, respectively, and are based
on Samuelson’s specifications and empirical lags reported for the U.S. by Easterlin et al. (1978) and Lee (1974).

period 1941~79. The error term was
found to be serially correlated and so the
equation was estimated using the
Beach-McKinnon (1978) maximum
likelihood technique. The results are
consistent with the relative cohort size
model outlined above. The variables
were correctly signed and significant at
the 0.05 level in one-tailed tests. The
overall equation is significant at the 0.01
level.

As may be seen from accuracy statistics reported in Table 1, the relative cohort mode] is a good representation of
the variation in post-war total live
births. The mean absolute error is about
11,000 births, or less than 3 per cent of
mean births. The model is superior to an

assumption of constancy of births (the
Theil statistic is less than one), and most
of the error is in the disturbance proportion, that is, itis random.

It has been argued above that immigration is unlikely to invalidate the
model. This assumption was checked by
adding a variable which measured the
total number of married female immigrants aged 15-39 years lagged one year
to Equation (2). As may be seen in Table 1, this assumption was supported.
The immigration variable had a ¢ value
of less than one and did not alter the estimated parameters or accuracy statistics
of the model.

Although the model is specified to
have generational lags of twenty years,

and empirical findings cited support
these Jags, is the model sensitive to this
specific lag structure? An alternative lag
structure of 25 and 50 years has been
suggested as being closer to the model
childbearing age. The result of estimating the model with this lag structure over
the shorter period 1951—79 is shown in
Table 1. The pattern of signs on the
coefficients remains unchanged, but the
second term of the model is no longer
significant. However, the fit of the
model, as shown by the accuracy statistics, is quite similar. For example, the
mean absolute error is 1,300 births less.
The model seems quite robust with regard to this change in the lag structure.

LaVoie (1979) claimed that ‘“‘this
{Easterlin’s relative cohort size] theory
only accounts very roughly for changes
in fertility in Canada and consequently
is not an effective tool for making fertility projections.”* The results reported
above challenge the first of these statements. The second is, in part, an empirical matter to which we now turn.

Forecasts based on Equation (2) are
presented in Table 2 along with three
sets of forecasts from Denton et al.
(1980). Their low, medium, and high
forecasts assume terminal (2051) crude
birth rates of 8.2, 13.3, and 20.9 and to
2)_aVoie further argues that “‘it is difficult to believe, given the changing social context (especially
views on the role of women in society), that the relationship defined by Easterlin will hold true for
the next two decades.”” However, it is not clear
that societal changes are as fundamental as some
commentators have argued nor is it clear that they
are not endogenous (see Easterlin, 1980, for a full
discussion of these issues). The stability of the retationship is an empirical question and cannot, and
should not, be decided on the basis of beliefs in the
extent of societal change.

tal fertility rates of 1.5, 2.1, and 3.0, respectively. These bracket the two official forecasts of Statistics Canada
which assume total fertility rates of 1.7
and 2.1 (LaVoie, 1979). In contrast to
the present approach, both Denton et
al. and Statistics Canada derive forecasts of total live births by applying fertility rates to the female population of
childbearing age. Denton et al. uses a
Gompertz function based on assumed
future values of total lifetime fertility,
median age of mothers at childbirth, and
the interquantile ranges of their ages at
childbirth to project the age distribution
of fertility rates.

Although our main interest is to see
what direction the relative cohort model
predicts for fertility, it is also of interest
to see how accurate are its point estimates. For 1980-82 the MAE’s are
23,000 and 17,000 births or mean absolute percentage error of 6.2 and 4.6 per
cent for the models with 20 and 25 year
lags respectively. The MAPE’s for the
former decrease markedly over this period while those for the latter increase.
This is a respectable level of accuracy for
a variable which is traditionally difficult
to forecast. The model may, therefore,
be a useful complement to the models
currently used to forecast births.

The forecast with 20-vear lags from
the relative cohort model lie between
the low and medium forecasts of Denton et al. until the end of this decade and
between the medium and high forecast
for the remainder of the century. The
model based on 25-year generational
lags predicts 20 per cent fewer births in
the year 2000 than does the basic model,
although it does predict births to rise
significantly relative to the levels of the
early 1960’s. This difference reflects the
slower development of cycles in this

"The forecast including immigration assumes a constant level of immigration of 22,962. This figure is derived by multiplying
the Denton et al. (1980) medium immigration figure by 0.19. (Per cent of immigrants female = 0.51; per cent female immigrants

ci model. As shown in Table 2, the addi‘= tion of immigration to the model has rel= atively little impact on the forecasts.
The basic model predicts the underlying
total fertility rate to rise from its current
level to about 2.1 by 1990 and 2.6 by
2000.

We agree with Easterlin and Condran’s prediction of a new baby boom
for Canada, although the total fertility
rate predicted will be significantly lower
than the 3.9 rate experienced at the peak
of the post-war baby boom. The model
ignores the impact of variables other
than relative cohort size, and these variables may reduce births below the levels
forecast. However, the underlying relative cohort size mechanism is so strong
that these other factors are unlikely to
completely dampen the forecast rise in
births.?

3Ahlburg (1984) integrated the relative cohort
model and more traditional economic and sociological models of births. The forecasts of total live
births for the U.S. from this model were below
those of the relative cohort model but still indicated a significant rise in fertility.

 

CONCLUSION

The most commonly held view of
Canada’s demographic future would
seem to be that expressed by LaVoie
(1979): “*. . . we must resign ourselves
to a pattern of population growth in
which natural increase plays an ever
dwindling role. The best attitude would
be to accept the situation and to approach decision making with respect to
the family, education, and renewal of
the labor force, in the light of these new
data.”

However, given the history of fertility in Canada and the drastic changes
witnessed in the post-war period, this is
a position fraught with risk. As we have
shown above, if fertility is determined
by a relative cohort size mechanism, a
new “baby boom” is a real possibility. If
this fertility renewal occurs, the problems experienced in the labor market,
schools, and housing sector and caused
by the high fertility rates of the late
1940’s and 1950’s, may reoccur.

Consequently, we agree with Denton

et al. (1980) that “any realistic appraisal
of future [demographic] possibilities
must take into account the high degree
of uncertainty associated with the determinants of fertility and hence its future
level.” A renewal of fertility in Canada
cannot be discounted and policy recommendations should reflect this possibil
ity.
