This study attempts to relate family-size
preferences and attitudes toward birth
control with a number of variables like
caste, ethnicity, occupation, and education.
The data were collected in the “tribal belt”
of Bihar, a state in the northeastern part of
India, and are from a larger study in modernization by Amar K. Singh (in press).?
The sample consisted mainly of farmers,
inexperienced and experienced factory workers, and urban nonindustrial workers. The

1 The data were collected as part of the Harvard
Project on the Sociocultural Aspects of Development, directed by Alex Inkeles. The project was an
extensive and a complex one dealing with change in
attitudes, values, and habits relevant to the individual’s adjustment and contribution to a modern or
a modernizing society. Studies with the same overall
design were conducted in Chile, Argentina, Israel,
Nigeria, India, and Pakistan. The main study tested
the general proposition advanced by Alex Inkeles
that experience in a modern industrial enterprise
induces changed attitudes, which, on the whole,
make men better adapted and more effective citizens
of a modern society. The factory is seen not only asa
productive enterprise, but also as a school imparting
certain general lessons whose significance will be
felt far beyond the confines of the factory.

The basic design involved, among other things,
comparison of matched samples drawn from different
settings (e.g., modern vs. traditional factory) or having different degrees of exposure to the same setting
(those newly arrived as against those with several
years of experience). The main independent variable
was the extent of exposure to modernizing influences.

urban nonindustrial category included domestic servants, manual laborers, rickshaw
pullers, cart pushers, vegetable sellers, and
the like. The average income of the nonindustrial group was the same as of the factory
workers. An analysis of the sample according to ethnicity and occupation is given in
Table 1.

In the original study, data were meticulously collected through a long interview
with the help of a precoded interview schedule. The various sections of the interview
schedule helped in the scaling of the variables included in the study.

The two dependent variables in the present study are family-size preference and
attitude toward family planning. Several
questions were asked to provide a score for
an image of an ideal family size—preferred
family size as of the time respondents were
interviewed, under normal conditions, and
under ideal conditions of life. Similarly,
attitude toward family planning was measured by several questions—desirability of
limiting family, acceptance of birth control
on a physician’s advice, and use of birth control facilities provided by the government.

A large number of independent variables

were used in the larger study, but we have
only selected those which seemed to show a
significant relationship with the two dependent variables. References to the independent variables will be made during discussion of the findings. It is interesting that,
on the whole, people in this sample prefer
smaller families. As is evident from Table 2,
59% of the sample prefer to have no more
than three children, while 82% prefer no
more than four children.

Table 3 gives the values of coefficients of
correlation between the two dependent
variables and several other independent
variables. As will be seen from the table,
several variables are significantly associated
with the two dependent measures. There
are seven variables, each one of which
accounts for at least 10% variance in the
dependent variables taken individually
(ry? = 0.10). These are variables relating to
(lack of) fatalism, education, personal overall modernization (O.M.),? political O.M.,
and total O.M. (1 and 2), and family scale.
One interesting finding is the substantial amount of positive correlation between
the dependent variables themselves (r =
0.385). Those who desire a small family
also prefer to use family-planning methods
and are favorably disposed toward birth
control.

To better understand the relation of the
occupational and ethnic factors to familysize preference and attitude toward family
planning, the sample was divided into main
caste or ethnicity groups and major occupational groups. Tables 4 and 5 present the
distribution of the sample on these two dependent variables.

2 Inkeles (1966) defines modernization in terms of
readiness for new experience, openness for innovation and change, democratic orientation, general
planning in life, belief in efficacy of man over nature,
stress on dignity, faith in science and technology,
and belief in distributive justice. Inkeles recognizes
five sources of modernizing influence: urbanization,
mass communication, development of a nation-state,
the modern factory; and the last, but perhaps the

most important of all, schools emphasizing a modern
type of curriculum.

Family Size and Planning in India 45

Table 4 shows the pronounced effect of
education among factory workers, particularly among the urban factory workers, with
regard to their attitude toward ideal family
size. High-educated factory workers significantly differ from the low-educated factory
workers in urban areas, irrespective of ethnicity, caste, or religion. Both in rural and

rura)-urban areas, high education apparently exercises an influence on the factory workers’ attitude toward small family size, but it
does not seem to have such an influence in
purely urban areas.

Another interesting indication from the
data in Table 4 is that education does not
seem to influence the attitude toward small
family size in the nonfactory population
(cultivators and urban nonindustrial workers). The only exception is among the lowcaste Hindus whose views on ideal family
size differ according to their educational
level. If we ignore this small difference, we
may be able to contrast the two major
groups: factory workers and nonfactory
workers. The main difference between these
two groups seems to be one based on instiDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

tutionalization; workers in a factory tend
to be more influenced by factory mores and
values, while the nonfactory workers (farmers, rickshaw pullers, servants, etc.) tend to
be less exposed to such institutional influences,

Table 5 shows again the effect of education on the attitude toward birth control.
However, the influence of education in this
case is significant only in nonfactory groups
(cultivators and urban nonindustrial work
- ers). The factory workers, whether in rural,

Social Biology

urban, or rural-urban areas, exhibit favorable attitudes toward birth control, irrespective of their educational level. In other
words, the factory environment seems to
overcome the unfavorable attitude associated with low education. Inkeles (1966)
points out that the factory is not only an
employing agency but also an educating
agency. The socializing influence of the
working conditions in the factory seems to
underlie the uniformly favorable attitude
toward family planning.

The comments made about Tables 3 and 4
above raise several questions. Table 4 shows
that education differentiates factory workers in their concept of ideal family size.
What happens to the educative influence of
the factory atmosphere? And why do the
cultivator and urban-nonindustrial-worker
groups show no differences due to education? Since the two dependent variables under study are significantly correlated, we
expect to find similar results in Tables 4 and
5. However, we do not find such results.
One plausible explanation is that familysize preference is a widely shared norm
generated by the larger community in which
a person lives and that the change in such a
deeply ingrained norm comes about when a
person has a new reference group (an institution, like a factory) and also has exposure
to the wider world (through education).
On the other hand, attitude toward birth
control may be more a function of more
knowledge about it, and this is provided
either by exposure to formal education
(and, therefore, possibility of reading, or
by exposure to informal sources of information (in an institution, like a factory).
It is evident from the two tables that
both formal education and membership in a
work organization are important in influencing family-size norms and attitudes toward
birth control.

dependent variables, some matched groups

groups on their attitudes toward small family size, the three components of their attitudes toward family planning, and overall
modernization.

Among the cultivators (Matched Group
4), those with high education differ significantly from those with low education on all
the variables, that is, family-size preference, attitude toward family planning, and
overall modernization. The role of urbanization is immediately perceptible when the
cultivators and urban nonindustrial workers are compared. Except on family size,

some of the variables which seem to account

differentiate people with regard to their
