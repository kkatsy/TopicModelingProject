Outcrossings in Caucasians and Fetal Loss

Jack B. Bresler

Tufts University
Medford, Massachusetts

A rapid increase in outcrossing, or mating
between ethnic groups, has been noted in
the United States in the past twenty years.
There is considerable evidence that there
has been a decline in consanguinity rates
and a simultaneous increase in the frequency
of interethnic marriages. Nonetheless, there
have been few studies on the consequences
of outcrossing. This report conveys the
findings of a research project on the interrelationships among three factors: fetal loss,
the number of countries in the background
of parents, and the distances between birthplaces of parents.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Data were collected on every pregnant
woman entering the clinic of the Providence
Lying-in Hospital, Rhode Island, during the
calendar years 1960-1961 and on 131 consecutive pregnant private patients who visited an obstetrician during April and May of
1961.

About 40% of the infants born in Rhode
Island and 65% of those born in Providence
in the early 1960’s were delivered in the
Providence Lying-in Hospital. A large number of women residing in the state delivered
most or all of their infants at this hospital.
Hence, it was possible to obtain a nearcomplete, and at times complete, reproduc

tive history on many women from the hospital medical records.

However, for local administrative reasons, data on abortions and stillbirths prior
to a first live delivery in the Providence
Lying-in Hospital, were not available.
Therefore, only fertile women, generally in
their mid-reproductive stages, who had at
least one prior live birth in the hospital, had
usable records for purposes of this investigation. This qualification signifies there is no
attempt to produce a “‘standard”’ for fetal
loss in relation to the number of pregnancies.
Naturally the women in this study would be
older and have had more pregnancies than
those in any nationally based set of averages.

From the Providence Lying-in Hospital
records, data were collected on parental ethnic groups, place of birth, illegitimate births,
twin births, clinical condition, and other
factors which could influence the inclusion
or exclusion of the woman and family unit
in the sample. Additional and corroborative
information on reproductive history of the
women was obtained from other hospitals
and many gynecologists and obstetricians
in Rhode Island.

An in-depth interview was arranged with
each woman in the sample to obtain the
desired ethnic information. Specifically, each
woman was asked to supply information on

race, religion, and national origin for: (a)
herself and her husband (two individuals in
the P; generation); (0) her parents and her
husband’s parents (four individuals in the
P, generation); and (c) her grandparents and
her husband’s grandparents (eight individuals in the P; generation). Since few women
could provide this detailed information immediately, each was asked to complete the
survey sheet at home. In addition, each
woman was asked to provide additional information about herself and her husband
(P; generation), such as birthplace, age,
prior pregnancies, adoption, and _ illegitimacy.

Originally, complete records were sought
for 792 clinic patients and 131 private
patients. Certain items of information were
deemed critical, and their absence was
sufficient cause for the elimination of the
records of a woman and her family from the
present analysis. Whole family histories
were eliminated if any one of the 42 pieces of
the “ethnic” data was unknown. Additional
reasons for exclusion from the main sample
were: a known illegitimacy in any prior live
birth, an incomprehensible reproductive
history, a reproductive history involving
two or more husbands, and the presence of
twins in any pregnancy. Excluded from this
report are the 158 family histories where one
or more individuals had an African background because interracial matings are not
the focus of the present study.

In summary, all matings accepted for
this ethnic study met the following conditions: (a) all 14 individuals in the family
history were white; (5) national origin and
religion was known for all 14 individuals in
the family unit; (c) according to the best
available information at the time, the pregnant women had never had an illegitimate
child, a previous husband, or twins; (d)
specific birthplaces were known for the
pregnant women and their husbands; (e) all
the pregnant women had at least one prior
live-born child. Almost all of the pregnant

women and their husbands lived in an urban-suburban environment in central Rhode
Island.

The data on reproductive wastage were
originally collected in terms of stillbirths and
abortions. At that time hospital officials
designated reproductive wastage of under 28
weeks as an abortion, and more than 28
weeks as a stillbirth. However, continued
experience In handling the data revealed
many inaccuracies in assignments compelling us to abandon the classification and
substitute the collective term “fetal loss.”

The sample presented in this paper contains 708 family histories. Of these, 593
were from clinic patients and 115 were from
private patients. These two subsamples were
combined after an analysis of two variables:
the average numbers of pregnancies and of
live births in each group. For clinic patients,
the averages were 3.31 and 2.99 respectively;
for private patients, the averages were 2.42
and 2.16 respectively. However, the critical
comparison is the percentage of live births
compared to total pregnancies. The population of clinic patients was unexpectedly
higher—90.2% as contrasted with 89.3%
for the private patients. A chi-square test
was made on private vs. clinic and live
births vs. fetal loss. The chi-square value
was 0.11 after a correction was made for
continuity, with P > 0.50.

The second consideration was a comparison of the number of countries of birth in
the parental generation (Ps) of the 708 couples. Up to six different countries were
found in the parental backgrounds of the
593 clinic couples. By number of countries
and number of couples, the figures were:
one, 189; two, 228; three, 137; four, 31; five,
7, and six, 1. The numbers for the 115 private patients were: one, 35; two, 45; three,
24; four, 9; five, 2; and six, 0. A ¢ test revealed P > 0.50.

It may also be argued that the relationship of socioeconomic status to fetal loss
represents a bar to combining the clinic and

private samples. Table 1 shows the assignment of the families into a tripartite socioeconomic atrangement.}

It is evident from the sample data that
socioeconomic status appears to have little
effect on fetal loss (chi-square test: live born
vs. fetal loss value is 0.134, 2 d.., P>
0.90). For this and other reasons cited
above, it was judged unnecessary to keep the
clinic and private samples separated for
analysis.

RESULTS

As expected, an analysis of the data
clearly shows that fetal loss increases with
age. However, in all of the subsequent analyses presented in the tables of this report this
factor did not show significant deviations
from the mean in any of the classes or
groups of data so as to represent a cause for
increased or decreased fetal loss.

data for four, five, and six countries were
combined in a test involving live born vs.
fetal loss, the chi-square equaled 8.87 with
the level of probability between 5% and 2%.

Family records were also separated into
two categories: (a) fetal loss never recorded
in the F; level; and (8) at least one fetal loss

Perhaps the prime relation is between
fetal loss at the Pi level (signifying the
generation at which fetal loss takes place)
and the number of countries of birth at the
P; generation. The data in Table 2 show
that with increasing number of countries in
the background, there is an ever-increasing
level of fetal loss at the F, level. When the

1Fach family (P; generation) was analyzed
independently by Miss Diana Skirmuntas, graduate
student in sociology, working under the guidance of
Dr. Louis Orzack. The evaluation was based on
methodology cited in Hodge, Siegel, and Rossi, 1964.

in the F; reproductive history. The mean
number of countries in the “Never” category was 2.024, while in the “Ever” category
it was 2.222. A ¢ test on the difference of the
means shows P > 0.025. Accordingly, the
two tests on data in Table 2 indicate that
more countries of national origin in the P;
background are associated with greater fetal
loss in the F; generation.

In Table 3, fetal loss and the number of
countries are reviewed again, but this time

grounds. The conglomerate super-cell of
information brings together six single cells
each having fewer than ten family histories.
The 1/1 cell in this table contains more
families than are found in the one-countryof-birth category of Table 2. Examination
of the data reveals that the 1/1 cell contains
many families which would appear in the

In Table 4, increasing distance between
P, birthplaces is associated with an increase
in the average number of countries of birth
two generations prior, a time span of approximately 70 years. Data from the two
rows indicated as 0-50 were compared in a

The distance between birthplaces within
the continental 48 states of the P, generation was charted on a straight-line basis. In
this analysis only 646 families were used,
since 62 were eliminated because one or both
of the P; generation members were foreign
born. The greatest distance between two
points in Rhode Island is approximately 50
miles, and thus couples born within the
state were placed in a separate category.
However, many couples then residing in
Rhode Island had birthplaces in other states
which were also less than 50 miles apart.
These too were put in a cognate category
below the ‘‘Rhode Island X Rhode Island”

difference in the average number of P3
countries between these two populations.
For a further chi-square test, data from the
last two rows were combined to make one
row of 1,000 miles or more. In addition, data
in the columns of 4, 5, and 6 countries were
combined, making 12 cells of data. The
twelfth cell has an expected value below
five. Omitting this cell results in a chi-square
value of 11.14, somewhat short of the 5%
level (6 d.f.); including the cell results in a
chi-square value of 16.02, and this is >1%
level.

Data in Table 5 show that with increasing distances there is greater fetal loss. Com

paring all matings involving less than 50
mile distance with all matings of more than
50 mile distance, and also comparing them
on a fetal loss vs. live born basis, the chisquare value was 8.21 or >1% after a correction for continuity was made. Admittedly, the relation between distance and fetal
loss alone is superficial, but the relation assumes meaning when viewed from the findings indicated in Table 4. The fundamental
relation is between fetal loss and number of
countries of birth with distance between
birthplaces “representing” this more significant association.

Table 6 contains the combined data of

Table 4 and 5. The relationship between increasing fetal loss and countries of birth is
corroborated. However, a difference between
the two distance groupings is noted. An immediate interpretation cannot be offered for
this “migration factor.” A subsequent fuller
report containing further analysis involving
interfaith and intrafaith religious matings,
blood group genes, height of parents, and
age of parents is planned.

COMPARATIVE DATA

An earlier report (Bresler, 1961) contained data on blood group genes and infant
hemoglobin. Data on reproductive wastage
were collected but never published. Those

evidence on a second population. Some
details concerning the population have immediate usefulness in this report, and it
would be well to summarize them,

Reproductive histories were collected on
all white, Rh negative women who entered
Providence Lying-in Hospital between the
years of 1950 and 1958. No cases were rejected for any clinical disorder. Certain
indices of the original data indicated that
the population was typical for the geographical area. These were the ABO distribution of mothers, fathers, and infants,
and the Rh distributions for fathers. As for
the present sample, which we shall designate
as Population A, data were collected on
women who had at least one prior live birth
in the hospital. In the latter part of 1961 we
contacted the parents by mail for the ethnic
information and received 391 useful histories.

In summary, the following information
was available on Population B: (¢) all
mothers were white and Rh negative; (8) all
fathers were white; (c) all members in the
P3 and Py», generation were listed as white;
(d) birthplace information was available on
all parents; (e) a reproductive history was
used only when no known or suspected illegitimacy, twins, or two husband situations
were indicated; and (/) all women had at
least one prior live birth.

In Tables 7 and 8 the number of countries
of birth in the P; generation is related to
factors previously analyzed for Population
A. Although there are insufficient numbers,
it is clear that there are replications of the
directions reported in Population A.

In Table 2 fetal loss begins at 7.6% for
the one-country category, whereas in Table
7 it begins at 8.6%. Ignoring all country
categories where five or fewer families are
found, the fetal-loss percentage increases
10.3% in four increments in Table 2 and
8.8% in three increments in Table 7. In
Table 2 the approximate average increment
is 2.6%, whereas in Table 7 it is 2.9%. Combining these data, the sum of the seven increments is 19.1%, or an approximate 2.7%
increase for each country. Hence, it would
tentatively appear that each additional

Social Biology

country adds between 2.5% and 3.0% fetal
loss. At least this appears to be the case in
the lower half of the theoretical range of
countries from 1 through 8.

TWINS

Twin data for 16 families in Population
A and 6 families in Population B were
available. The mothers in Population A had
72 pregnancies with an average of 4.5 each.
Five pregnancies failed to result in a live
birth, resulting in a 6.9% fetal loss. In
Population A, the P; generation had a 2.44
average number of countries in the P;
generation. For Population B the results
were respectively: 19 pregnancies, a 3.17
pregnancy average, 5.3% fetal loss, and 2.5
as the average number of countries. If, for
the sake of a broad overview, the results
from both populations are combined, the
results are: 91 pregnancies, a 4.13 pregnancy
average, 6.6% fetal loss, and 2.45 as the
average number of countries (P3).

The first observation to be made in comparing these results to those in Tables 2 and
7 is that the average number of pregnancies
is higher. Even more unexpected is the
markedly low fetal loss of 6.6% vs. 9.9%
(Population A) and 10.7% (Population B).
Thus, the fetal loss percentage of the twin
population is below the “‘one-country”’ category for either Population A or B, and there
is a higher average number of countries in
the twin population, 2.45 vs. 2.07 (A) and
2.13 (B). For the average number of countries, an approximate 10.6% fetal loss is
“expected” rather than the observed 6.6%.
No explanation can be offered on this twin
data combination of high fertility, low fetal
loss, and high average number of countries
in the background. It would appear, however, that women giving birth to twins have
a favorable reproductive history.

DISCUSSION

It is concluded that greater fetal loss is
indeed related to greater heterogeneity in

the background. This would appear to be
the case for two all-white samples in this
investigation. No extrapolation of these
findings can be made to interracial matings
at this time.

The adverse effect of additional countries
on fetal loss appears to be cumulative, there

previous generations. It was shown that the
greater the number of national origins in the
P, background, the lower was the completed
mean family size of the F; generation. The
findings of that study are complementary
with those of the two mid-reproductive
populations reported here, both of which

being no threshold, in terms of number of
countries, which is associated with a large
increase in fetal loss. Additional data involving six or more countries in the background are needed to see whether a threshold
exists at these levels. The salient question
remaining is how to relate this increased
fetal loss to genetic and/or social factors.

show increased fetal loss with outcrossings.
These collective results can best be interpreted from a genetic basis, with sociocultural factors entering into the findings in
a minor way. The most suitable explanation
is as follows: The greater the number of
countries in the background, the greater is
the likelihood that larger numbers of Mendelian gene pools are brought together. With
greater mixing of gene pools and concomitant genetic imbalance between loci, fetal
loss increases, Fortunately there is an ani

mal model which supports this view as
shown by the summary of the excellent
series of experiments conducted by Moore
(1943, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952)
which follows.

In many ways, the evolutionary status of
the North American frog, Rana pipiens, is
similar to the human species. The geographic range of the frog is very wide, encompassing virtually all of North America.
Rana pipiens is found in many different environments, such as both hot and cold areas,
wet and dry areas, and at high and low
altitudes. While the taxonomic status is not
clear, it seems reasonable to conclude that
the species complex contains a very large
collection of local geographical races even
though it is convenient to regard the whole
group as a “‘single’”’ species. For example, a
frequently used taxonomic set of characteristics such as pigmentation shows such a
bewildering array of clinal shifts that it is
difficult to sort the group into cohesive units
(Bresler, 1963, 1964).

Accordingly, Rane pipiens, like man, is a
vertebrate found in a very extensive geographical range—sometimes isolated, sometimes partially isolated, and sometimes in
broad panmictic populations. It is also
difficult to classify even with characteristics
commonly accepted by investigators.

Moore found that he could bring frogs
from different environments of the geographical range into the laboratory, make
appropriate genetic crosses, and study reproductive wastage and development. Significant findings include:

1. The hybrids between members of adjacent
geographical territories tended to be normal in development and morphology.

2. The greater the geographical distance between parental combinations in eastern
North America, the more retarded was the
rate of development, the greater were the
morphological defects in the hybrids, and
the fewer were the normal individuals.

3. The greater the geographical distance between parental combinations, the larger
was the percentage of eggs which failed to
develop properly.

Social Biology

4, The further apart in geographical distance
in eastern North America the members
were collected from, the earlier in development did reproductive wastage occur.

Strict comparisons between this study
and the previously published excellent study
on interracial crosses in Hawaii (Morton,
Chung and Mi, 1967) are difficult to make.
That study was addressed to first-generation racial hybrids and a complex of indices
of heterosis and recombination as well as
issues involving quality of live offspring. The
present study is an intraracial study of
matings involving significantly smaller evolutionary differences between parents and
their effect only on one index, fetal loss.

SUMMARY

Data on two white populations show that
fetal loss (F: generation) in matings of the
parental generation (P,) increases cumulatively by approximately 2.5% to 3% with
each additional country of birth in the greatgrandparental generation (P;). A dependent
relation shows that increased fetal loss is also
related to greater distances between birthplaces of mates within the P, generation.
Conversely, low fetal loss is encountered
with a small number of countries in the
background and shorter distance between
birthplaces.

It is suggested that a larger number of
countries of birth represents a larger number
of Mendelian gene pools and that with increased mixture of these gene pools, fetal
loss increases proportionately. An animal
model is cited in support of this contention.
