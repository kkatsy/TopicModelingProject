Childlessness and Age at
First Marriage

J. E. Veevers

A number of authors have commented
upon the relationship between the incidence of childlessness among women, and
their age at first marriage (Grabill, Kiser,
and Whelpton, 1958; Grabill and Glick,
1959; Mitra, 1966; Rele, 1965; Thompson and Lewis, 1965; Titmuss and Grundy,
1946). The explanation for the observed
correlation is generally implicitly attributed to the influence of physiological
factors. For example, after noting that
“voluntary childlessness is nearly extinct

. and... fecundity impairments are
now the chief cause of childlessness . . .”,
Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson (1966,
p. 165) simply comment:

The influence of age at marriage on the

proportion of couples with no children is

striking. Among wives in the 1921-25 cohorts, the proportion childless for those
who married at ages 21 or less (61% of all
wives) is 6%, for those marrying at ages

22 to 25 it is 11%, and for those marry
ing at ages 25 and over it is 20%.

The purpose of the present research is to
further exemplify the relationship between
age at marriage and childlessness by presenting data for high and low fertility
groups.

There are at least three logical reasons
for expecting that the major variables in

 

the correlation of childlessness and age at
marriage are biological in nature. First,
women who marry relatively late in life
are exposed to the risk of pregnancy for
fewer years than younger brides. Thomlinson makes no direct reference to the factor
of age at first marriage, but commenting
on racial differences in childlessness he
notes: |
The higher proportion of childless women
among whites than among nonwhites is partially explained by the fact that white
women are married for an average of two
thirds of their childbearing years, whereas
nonwhite women on the average are married for only about half of their potentially
fecund age period (Thomlinson, 1965, p.
175).
Second, fecundity tends to decline with
age, and the later marriage is postponed,
the lower the chances that one will be able
to bear even one child (Womble, 1966,
p. 382; Thomlinson, 1965, p. 148). Third,
those women who marry for the first time
very late, after the age of 40, may already
be experiencing the beginning of menopause and rapidly approaching total sterility. It is suggested that even though
each of these arguments are to some extent valid, demographers have generally
tended to overestimate the importance of

subfecundity in explaining childlessness
among women who marry late.

If the variation in incidence of childlessness by age at first marriage were due
entirely to the loss of fecundity with advancing age, it would be expected that in
all populations approximately equal proportions of women who had married at a
given age would remain childless. In order
to assess the relative importance of involuntary factors, compared with the voluntary decision to forego parenthood, we
tried to select a group of women among
whom virtually all childlessness could be
attributed to natural sterility or subfecundity and to contrast their rates of childlessness with a group of women among
whom voluntary childlessness would be
expected to be more common. Childlessness is known to be higher in urban areas
than in rural nonfarm areas, and the latter
is higher than in rural farm areas (Grabill
and Glick, 1959, Harrington, 1969, Veevers, 1971).

It was assumed voluntary childlessness
would be minimal among those women
with high positive values on fertility and
with strong religious proscriptions against

the use of birth control and abortion.
These two variables were combined to select two extreme groups of women from
the Canadian population: urban women
in British Columbia, who are 16% Roman
Catholic, and rural farm women in Quebec who are 96% Roman Catholic. For
each of these groups, the proportion of
wives who are permanently childless is
given in Table 1. To provide an even more
extreme base line for comparison, the
maximum and minimum rates of childlessness observed for any cohort are also presented.

An examination of the rates of childlessness among women in urban British
Columbia shows that the chances of achieving motherhood vary markedly with age
at first marriage. The woman who is a
teenage bride has a 94.8% chance of having a child, compared with the 71.6%
chance of a woman who marries in her
early thirties. If marriage is postponed
until the late thirties, the probabilities
drop still further to only about 50%.
However, when comparable data is examined for women in rural farm Quebec,
the contrast is less apparent. Teenage

brides there also have a very high probability of becoming mothers (97.1%), but
when marriage is postponed until the early
thirties they still have an 85.6% chance
of achieving parenthood. In a society with
virtually no resource to effective birth
control, a woman married for the first
time in her late thirties still has a 76.2%
chance of bearing at least one child. When
consideration is given not to the actual
incidence of childlessness, but to the maximum and minimum rates which have been
recorded for specific age cohorts, the discrepancy is even more apparent. For example, consider women married for the
first time in their early thirties. In one
extreme case in British Columbia (women
aged 55-59 in 1961) only 65.5% eventually became mothers; in another in
Quebec (women over 65 in 1961), over
90% had at least one child.

Of all Canadian women who ever marry,
most (96%) do so for the first time before the age of 35 (Dominion of Canada,
1961). Although there may be some
changes in fecundity with advancing age,
involuntary sterility does not set in until
after that age (Bogue, 1969, p. 730).
Given the low rates of childlessness among
women in rural farm Quebec, regardless
of their age at first marriage, it is suggested that at least for women who marry
for the first time before the age of 35,
most of the variation in incidence of childlessness cannot be explained simply in
physiological terms. The factors of reduced

fecundity and of fewer number of years
of exposure to pregnancy risk may make
a substantial difference in the total number of children ever born, but apparently
have only a limited effect on the somechildren vs. no-children dichotomy. It is
possible that women who postpone getting
married until the late twenties or early
thirties are atypical of the general population not only in their attitudes towards
marriage, but also in their evaluation of
the desirability of motherhood and in their
interpretation of the feminine role. Perhaps the predispositions which prevent
early marriage are also associated with a
decreased inclination to parenthood and
a relatively higher incidence of voluntary
childlessness.

CONCLUSIONS

The variation in childlessness by age at
first marriage has been attributed mainly
to biological factors. An examination of
childlessness among a high fertility group
of women reveals that when the influence
of birth control is minimal, even women
who marry for the first time in their early
thirties have a very high probability of
bearing at least one child. Comparable
data for a low fertility group suggests
that, at least for women who marry before the age of 35, psychological disinclination to parenthood may be a major
factor in explaining the correlation with
age of marriage and incidence of childlessness,
