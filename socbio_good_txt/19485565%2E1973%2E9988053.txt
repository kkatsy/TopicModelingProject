A Biometrical Genetic Approach

to Intelligence and Schizophrenia

D. W. Fulker

Department of Psychology
University of Birmingham
Birmingham, England

Recently, the psychogenetics group at
Birmingham University has been consider~ing the problem of applying biometrical
genetics to the behavior of man. While these
methods had proved their worth when applied to the behavior of animals (Broadhurst, 1960; Broadhurst and Jinks, 1961,
1966; Fulker, Wilcock, and Broadhurst,
1972), the work of Cattell, one of the pioneers of human psychogenetics, suggested
that the same clear-cut results could not be
expected with humans (Cattell, 1957,
1965). A preliminary investigation at Birmingham resulted in the development of
an appropriate methodology and a reanalysis of existing data, the outcome of which
suggested that biometrical genetics could
be applied to the analysis of human behavior
with far greater ease than was previously
thought (Jinks and Fulker, 1970).

It is the purpose of the present paper to
give a brief account of this approach and
its underlying assumptions and to illustrate
its use by applying it to the genetics of intelligence and schizophrenia. The application to intelligence follows closely the
analysis given in Jinks and Fulker (1970).
Although a statistically superior and more
direct method was used, the outcome was
essentially the same. The analysis of schizo
 

phrenia represents a novel application of the
approach.

The biometrical genetic approach, as
developed originally by Fisher (1918),
involves partitioning the total observed
variance of a trait into components reflecting the effects of an indefinite number of
both genes and environmental influences. If
we are concerned with human behavioral
traits, the least number of effects required
to be at all realistic is five. On the genetic
side, we must allow for the effects of additive and dominant gene action and that of
assortative mating, while on the environmental side we must allow for the effects of
a common family or shared environment, as
well as those environmental effects unique
to the individual.

In order to separate these components, a
number of different types of biological and
social family groupings—such as pairs of
siblings reared together and apart and
monozygotic twins—must be used. Variances and covariances, or correlations, derived from these groups reflect to different
extents the genetic and environmental influences responsible for individual differences in the population. Although it is
preferable for technical reasons to work
with variances and covariances, the model

266

can be illustrated most effectively in terms
of correlations. The expectations of the
correlations obtained from several types of
families can be seen in Table 1. The correlations shown are those obtained by Burt for
IQ and are based on over 1,600 British
school children (Burt and Howard, 1956;
Burt, 1966). The test used with the children was a reliable group test standardized
against Burt’s revision of the Terman-Binet,
augmented by further individual testing
where results were at variance with teachers’
assessments.

The composition of the correlations are
shown in columns four to seven. For monozygotic twins reared together, for example,
the correlation reflects four of the five components of the model. The fifth component,
the unique effects of environment, which
does not appear in the expectations in the
table, is given by 1 —7r. With r= 0.92 we
can see that only 8% of variance is due to
this source. The expectation of monozygotic
twins reared apart is the same, apart from
the effects of a common family or shared
environment. For dizygotic twins and siblings reared together, the expectations are
identical: half the additive variance, a
quarter of the dominance variance, all the
assortative mating variance and, of course,
the effects of common environment. The
expectations for the other groups are shown
in the rest of the table.

To estimate the parameters in this model,
an approximate maximum likelihood method
was used which took into account the different amounts of information available for
each statistic, the information being inversely related to the square of the standard
errors shown in column three of the table.

The estimates obtained are shown at the
foot of the table; 59% of variance is additive, 13% is due to dominance, 11% to
assortative mating, and only 9% due to
common environment, this leaving 8% for
the unique effects of environment. However,

267

the expected correlations in column 8 based
on these estimates, although in general
matching the observed correlations rather
well, indicate one discrepant statistic, that
for unrelated individuals reared together.
The x3 of 6.3 for the failure of fit of the
model is not quite significant at the 5%
level, but a much better fit is obtained by
dropping this group from the analysis,
which reduces the x? to 0.28 and gives the
estimates in the bottom row. The two sets
of estimates are quite similar, however,
since the correlation for the unrelated children reared together carries relatively little
weight in the analysis, its standard error
being relatively large. It is a powerful advantage of the maximum likelihood estimation procedure that it simultaneously gives
reliable estimates and a means of assessing
the adequacy of the model.

The significantly better fit obtained by
dropping the correlation for unrelated children reared together indicates this statistic
is biased and suggests a failure of one of the
assumptions underlying the simple model
shown in the table. Consequently, before
going on to use the genetic components to
estimate the level and direction of dominance and the number of genes controlling
IQ, we must examine the validity of the
underlying assumptions.

These assumptions fall into three groups.
The first assumption is that the components
appropriate for any one group are also appropriate for the others, that is, that the
sampling of genotypes and environments
has been essentially at random and that the
model is equally applicable to all groups.
The simplest way to test this assumption is
to examine the means and variances of the
groups for homogeneity. Using analysis of
variance to test the homogeneity of means,
together with tests for homogeneity of
variance, has enabled us to select for
phenotypes such as neuroticism’ and extroversion reasonably homogeneous groups for

analysis and to reject groups which were
inadequately sampled or biased (Jinks and
Fulker, 1970). With Burt’s data, a thorough
investigation of sampling is not possible
since he did not give all the required
statistics. However, those means and variances he did give suggest that the groups
differed very little from each other and
were reasonably homogeneous (Burt, 1956,
1966).

A further test of the equality of compo“nents between the groups is provided by
“ithe maximum likelihood model fitting pro8 cedure itself, which, as we saw, suggested
F rejecting the correlation for unrelated chil© dren reared together as inconsistent with the
oo rest. Burt also regarded this correlation as
& suspect, suggesting that selective placement
“‘had operated to make it spuriously high.
~ In the case of the monozygotic twins reared
apart, however, Burt was able to show
Sothat selective placement, at least with re‘S spect to socioeconomic status, had probably
‘Snot occurred since the correlation between
6 biological and adoptive parents was essentially zero. The consistency of the correlaotions remaining after rejecting that for
‘sunrelated children reared together, which
includes this unbiased correlation for mono2 zygotic twins apart, suggests that the corre@ lation for siblings reared apart is unbiased
S too.

8 A second assumption, and one which is
A not tested very throughly by the model
fitting procedure, is that of no interaction
between genetic and environmental effects.
However, this assumption may be tested
quite simply by looking for differential
stability of environmental effects among the
pairs of monozygotic twins reared apart.
Just as genotype-environment interaction
in animal populations can be detected as
heterogeneity of environmental variance in
different isogenic groups, so, because each
pair of twins is isogenic, the differences between members of a pair should be homo
~

geneous if there is no genotype-environment
interaction (Jinks and Fulker, 1970).
The environmental differences for the
53 pairs of monozygotic twins reared apart
were compared with the genotypic values
for each pair, as indicated by the twin pair
sums, both by means of scatter diagrams
and by means of linear and non-linear correlations, and there was no evidence of
interactions for IQ (Jinks and Fulker,
1970; Eaves, 1970). This finding has
recently been confirmed by Jensen (1970)
using data from four studies of monozygotic
twins reared apart. However, by means of
further tests, based on this rationale, evidence of considerable genotype-environment
interaction has been found for a number of
personality traits (Eaves, 1970); but, as
far as IQ is concerned, there seems very
little evidence of this kind of interaction.
The third assumption underlying the
simple model is that there is no correlation
between genetic and environmental effects,
an assumption many psychologists find quite
unacceptable for many behavioral traits and
particularly for IQ. For example, if a parent
with high IQ provides an environment that
promotes the development of high IQ, then
he provides his offspring with both favorable genes and favorable environments. This
situation would lead to the shared genes
and shared environments of siblings being
positively correlated producing an apparent
increase in genetic variance. It was the
possibility of this and other kinds of correlations between genetic and environmental
influences that led Cattell to develop
MAVA, his multiple abstract variance analysis (Cattell, 1965) which implies that
simple biometrical models would fail.
Fortunately, we can detect this kind of
effect by comparing the variance of groups
reared together with those reared apart,
where an inflation of variance will not occur.
In Burt’s data, the variances of monozygotic twins reared apart and full sibs to

gether were almost identical, the F ratio for
105 and 527 df being only 1.04, which
strongly suggests that a correlated effect is
not operating. This finding may seem surprising until we consider how much care was
taken, through the retesting of children in
the case of doubtful results, to prevent this
kind of bias from occurring in Burt’s data.
Further, the relative unimportance of shared
environments for IQ means that even if this
bias is present, it can only have a fairly
small effect.

Having some faith, then, in the validity
of the estimates of the genetic and environmental components, we may find that they
may be used to indicate something of the
“venetic architecture” (a term used by
Mather [1953] to refer to a detailed description of the genetic system) of IQ.

The top part of Table 2 gives the expec

dominance component also reduces to a
simple expression when # — v. If we have
equal gene frequencies, the square root of
twice the dominance component divided by
the additive component indicates the average level of dominance (see Table 3). The
component for assortative mating reflects a
fraction of the additive variance dependent
on A, the correlation of additive effects
between parents, which in turn reflects the
genetic component in assortative mating.
Three other statistics can help us to
interpret these components. These are the
overall third moment, 3, the average
within-family third moment, %3, and the
extent of inbreeding depression, measured
as the difference between the means of an
outbred and an inbred group (44, — M;).
The third moment &3 is a complex function
of unequal gene frequencies (#%—v) and

tations of the genetic components of
Fisher’s model in terms of individual gene
effects. The notation is that developed by
Mather (Mather, 1949; Mather and Jinks,
1971) who greatly extended Fisher’s original model. The additive component reflects
gene frequencies, # and v, and both homozygous effects, d, and heterozygous or dominance effects, 4. Only when «= v (col. 3)
does the component reduce to an expression
in terms of homozygous effects only. The

However, £3 is free of the effects of unequal
gene frequencies and may always be used
to detect directional dominance providing
the distribution of environmental effects is
not skewed. The absence of genotype-environment interaction suggests normality of
distribution for the effects of the environment, and Jensen (1970) has recently
convincingly demonstrated this to be the

case. If gene frequencies are equal, k3 =

4ks, thus providing a useful test for equal
frequencies.

M,— My reflects the linear effects, or
direction, of dominance weighted by the
gene frequencies and f, Wright’s inbreeding
coefficient. The value of f is 1/16 for the
offspring of cousins, probably the most
readily available inbred group in human
populations.

quencies. Since both methods underestimate
the number of loci, we can see that very
many genes must be involved in controlling
individual differences in IQ.

The genetic architecture indicated by this
analysis suggests that high IQ has been
associated with a high level of reproductive
fitness and strong directional selection
during man’s evolutionary history which in
turn supports the idea that IQ is a biologically valid measure of intelligence.

The heritability appropriate for prediction of IQ in offspring—the so-called “narrow” heritability—is obtained as the sum
of the variance due to additive gene action
and assortative mating, taken as a fraction
of the total variation (Jinks and Fulker,
1970) that is 0.70 or 70%. It is interesting
that this figure predicts fairly accurately the
frequency of subnormality in the offspring
of both one and two subnormal parents
given by Reed and Reed (1965). They
arbitrally define subnormality in their population as an IQ less than 69. On this
definition, the offspring of two subnormal
parents were found to be 39% subnormals.
Using the expression for response to selec

tion and normal probability tables leads to
a predicted frequency of 38%. Where only
one parent is subnormal and the other
unspecified, the observed frequency drops
to 16% and the predicted frequency, allowing now for the effects of assortative mating,
is 17%. While some error is likely to result
from the use of normal probability tables
when we know IQ does not conform precisely to a normal distribution, the error is
likely to be small and the predictions are
strikingly good. These predictions suggest,
as Reed and Reed argue, that a great deal
of subnormality is due to the polygenic
nature of IQ.

Turning from a clear-cut and straightforward analysis for IQ, I will indicate
what a polygenic model for schizophrenia
suggests regarding gene action. However,
the analysis is presented as a possible approach and the results should, at best, be
regarded as suggestive only.

Kringlen’s (1966) sample was obtained

psychotics kept in Norway. Of the 178
twins in Table 4 given as dizygotic in
Kringlen’s study, there are six same-sex
twins of unknown zygosity. These six twins
had zero concordance for schizophrenia and
have been included in the dizygotic group
to avoid omitting any of the twins identified
by the sampling procedure. The majority
of them are expected to be dizygotic and it
seems likely they all were. In any case,
inclusion or exclusion makes very little

1971), would be much less serious and

formation about the effects of the common
family environment. Heston’s (1966) data
are based on a follow-up study of the children of 47 schizophrenic mothers confined
to a state hospital in Oregon and those of
Rosenthal et al. (1968) are derived from
adoption registers in Denmark. The concordance of 3/54 given in Table 4 was estimated from the tables in their paper and
may be slightly in error because of doubt
concerning the diagnosis of parents who had
died prior to the study. The maximum possible effect of this error could only lower the
concordance from 7.92% to about 7.70%,
which in turn would have the effect of improving the fit of the genetic model suggested. Any error was therefore judged to
be of trivial importance.

The concordance rates in Table 4 are
simple pair concordances based on fairly
clear-cut cases of schizophrenia. Age corrections have not been made because age of
onset is correlated in relatives leading to
overestimates of concordances when any
simple correction procedure is adopted. As a
result, age effects are probably confounded
to some extent with those of the environment. Bias from this source is not expected
to be large since Kringlen’s data, which are
for all practical purposes free of age bias,
are homogeneous with the other three sets
of twin data.

Heterogeneity chi-square tests suggest

Biometrical Genetics

273

that samples within each of the three groups
are sufficiently homogeneous to be pooled
for the present purpose and a tetrachoric
correlation was calculated for each. This
correlation was based on a population incidence (f#) for schizophrenia of 1.14%, the
value found by Kringlen for his twins and
very close to that suggested by numerous
other studies (Slater and Cowie 1971).
The procedure of calculating a tetrachoric correlation assumes a continuous
normal distribution of liability to schizophrenia with a threshold for the expression
of the disease, a model which has been suggested by Gottesman and Shields (1967).
The basic model was developed in a rigorous manner by Falconer (1965) who has
applied it to the inheritance of a number
of diseases (Falconer, 1967). An interesting
account has also been provided by Edwards
(1969) who gives a simple approximate
formula, developed by Penrose, for estimating the tetrachoric correlation. The correlations and their standard errors given in
Table 4 were calculated using this formula
in the manner suggested by Edwards.
Table 5 presents a simple genetical
model fitted to the tetrachoric correlations,
a model that omits the effects of assortative
mating since on 2 strict threshold model
no substantial effect can occur. Data on
assortative mating (Erlenmyer-Kimling
and Paradowski, 1966) suggests a 2% con

cordance rate for spouses so that the majority of spouses should be mating more or
less at random. While a strict threshold
model is probably unrealistic for schizophrenia, a 2% concordance for spouses only
implies the low marital correlation of about
0.1 and a value of A of 0.07. Since this
figure is an upper limit for assortative
mating, the effects on Fisher’s model are
likely to be very slight. It therefore seems
fairly safe to ignore its effects. When the
restriction of assortative mating is relaxed,
Fisher’s model becomes identical with that
of Mather (1949) in which the requirement
of many loci is not made. That is, the biometrical model and its expectations hold for
any number of loci, including the simple
case of a single locus. Thus, the biometrical
analysis presented here subsumes single
gene models as special cases. If schizophrenia is under the contro! of few genes, it
is not surprising that present analytical
methods are unable to distinguish between
single gene and polygenic models, a fact
noted by Elston and Campbell (1970).

If we accept this model, the results of the
analysis are very simple and suggest only
additive variation with no effects due either
to dominance or to a common or shared
environment. Maximum likelihood estimation confirms this simple model, the x? for
failure of the model being nonsignificant
(Table 5). Gottesman and Shields (1968)
reached exactly the same conclusions regarding the genetic model underlying
schizoprenia using a similar but more intultive approach and a greater volume of the
available data. This agreement adds support
to the present finding and suggests the
value of using the more systematic and
economical approach of biometrical genetics.

The absence of common family environmental influences, combined with a high
heritability, seems to favor a biological
rather than a cultural explanation for

Social Biology

schizophrenia, and the absence of dominance suggests an evolutionary history of
stabilizing selection for an intermediate
optimum, characteristic of other personality traits and in contrast to the picture for
IQ (Jinks and Fulker, 1970).

The heritability of 73% found for
liability allows an accurate prediction of the
frequency of schizophrenia in the offspring
of two schizophrenics, which Slater and
Cowie (1971) give as 37%, a figure based
on all available data. Using the expression
for response to selection and Falconer’s
(1965) tables for calculating tetrachoric
regressions gives a predicted frequency of
39%, a remarkably close prediction.

The outcome of this analysis appears to
be satisfactory, but both the data and the
model require further support. The concordances used can be disputed, depending
on the definition of schizophrenia and the
method of computing concordance, and age
effects have to some extent been ignored.
The underlyinz assumptions of the model
are difficult to test fully and it may only
be an approximation to reality. However,
it should be rernembered that the model can
subsume single gene models as special cases
and does not even depend on the existence
of a real threshold, a semantic or arbitrary
threshold being all that is required
(Edwards, 1969). The approach is capable
of considerable elaboration, and it is suggested that given more groups and reliable
data it might prove both useful and
powerful.

In conclusion, the application of these
fairly simple biometrical genetic techniques
to problems of the inheritance of human
behavior is reasonably straightforward and
looks quite promising. Of course, the two
examples given were chosen partly because
they present few difficulties and serve to
illustrate the approach. However, other
applications have been successful too, and

where they have not, due either to shortcomings of the data or to a failure of a
simple model, it has usually been possible to
arrive at a partial solution or to elaborate
the model in some suitable fashion (Jinks
and Fulker 1970). The strength of biometrical genetics lies in its systematic yet
flexible approach and its appropriateness
