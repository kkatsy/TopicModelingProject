ABSTRACT: Among Canadian Mennonites whose ancestors left Flanders in the sixteenth
century, one group separated as the Old Colony and part migrated in the 1920’s from Canada to
Mexico, where they constitute a large inbred isolate. In 1967, survey data including migration
histories were collected on one-third of the households in one subdivision, the ‘“M Colony.”
Church records were copied that gave vital statistics and surnames of almost all families in the
Colony since the migration. Recent migration patterns show marriage restricted by distance
and 37 per cent of resident married men remaining in their village of birth; but male migration
history for those who migrate within the M Colony shows almost no effect of distance. Analysis
of surnames gives an estimate of cumulative inbreeding of F = 0.0096, which is consistent with
the individually estimated components, namely, founder effect, historical population

constrictions, and slow genetic drift.

A population that excludes immigrants from reproduction is subject to
breeding isolation and gradually becomes inbred; that is, it loses genetic diversity among individuals and heterozygosity within individuals. At the same
time, through drift of gene frequencies,
it diverges genetically from the ancestral
population and from related populations.

Within an isolated population, or
within a large population that is not isolated, subdivision may restrict migration
and promote inbreeding within, and differentiation among, the subpopulations. Even in the absence of definite
isolation or subdivision, space alone
leads to isolation by distance and hence
to local inbreeding and differentiation.
The mathematical dependence of inbreeding on subdivision and on isolation
by distance has been studied extensively
(Wright, 1946; Malécot, 1948).

In a completely isolated population
considered as a whole, the rate of in
166

breeding depends on size or, more precisely, on effective population number
(Wright, 1931; Kimura and Crow,
1963). Since population size may vary
over time, numerical history of the population is important, particularly at
times of population constriction. Size at
the time of founding is the most important because then constriction is likely to
be greatest and because all genetic variation in subsequent generations, neglecting mutation, is derived from members of the founding generation. This is
commonly referred to as the founder effect.

The study of gene frequencies and
genotypes in a population by bioassay
methods such as blood typing (Morton
et al., 1968) permits estimation of inbreeding and of divergence between
populations on a large scale and over
long spans of time for which pedigrees
are lacking or unreliable. Nearly equivalent in human populations, and much
more accessible, is the diversity of sur

names and the frequency of isonymous
marriages, 1.e., marriages between persons of the same surname (Crow and
Mange, 1965). This report presents migration and surname data from a human
isolate and attempts to explain the inbreeding inferred from surnames in
terms of numerical history and recent
migration patterns.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE OLD CoLoNny

The human isolate which is the subject of this study is known as the Old
Colony, a religious community with political subdivisions in Canada, Mexico,
and some other Latin American countries. They show important similarities
and contrasts to better-known isolates
such as the Hutterites and the Old Order Amish. They have retained a Low
German dialect and many features of
the family-based agrarian culture inherited from their sixteenth-century ancestors of Belgium and Holland. In Chihuahua Province, Mexico, these people
occupy sharply demarcated areas surrounded by contrasting Mexican peoples and cultures (Redekop, 1969; Sawatsky, 1971). In 1967 the Old Colonists
in Chihuahua numbered 23,000 people
by their own accounting, distributed in
four geographically separated political
subdivisions or settlements.

The short distances within a subdivision and the near limitation of marriage
and migration, except emigration, to
within its boundaries resemble conditions on a small island. Well-separated
villages, apparently mapped with adequate precision, yield conveniently discrete distances. Pedigree information 1s
limited to three or four generations, but

 

Old Colony Mennonites 167

those generations are well documented
in the church records.

Mennonites originated in Switzerland and in Holland in the sixteenth century, and during the Inquisition the
Dutch Mennonites fled to eastern Europe. After long sojourns in Prussia and
Russia, where numbers may have exceeded 150,000, about 7,000 migrated to
Canada in the 1870’s. There, around
1890, a conservative group called itself
the Old Colony and separated from others who shared their history. In the
1920’s about 6,000 of these Old Colonists, at least 2,000 married adults,
moved to Mexico where they eventually
formed about 15 settlements, chiefly in
Chihuahua and Durango provinces (Redekop, 1969; Sawatsky, 1971). In Chihuahua Province, in addition to the four
Old Colony settlements, there are other
denominations of Mennonites, both
conservative and relatively progressive.
Judging from our data, there is no intermarriage between the Old Colony and
the other Mennonites and very little between the Mexican Old Colonists and
those who remained behind in Canada.

The largest of the four Old Colony
subdivisions in Chihuahua, known as
the Manitoba Plan or Manitoba Colony
and the subject of the study, was 50 km.
long and barely traversable in one day
by horse-drawn vehicles. After 1962,
however, the Manitoba Colony, hereafter abbreviated to M Colony, benefited
from a paved central highway and a bus
service which carried the colonists not
only from one end of their subdivision to
the other, but also into the partly surrounded Mexican town of Cuauhtémoc.
At the time of our study, which fortuitously coincided with an official local
“Land Survey” hereafter referred to as
the Census, the population of the M

Colony comprised about 10,000 persons
in 45 discrete villages on a tract of
230,000 acres (93,000 hectares).

DATA COLLECTION

This is the first publication of findings
since a report on a 1966 pilot study (Allen and Redekop, 1967). The original
research plan called for collection of demographic and psychosocial data on all
households and monitoring of individual differences in survival and reproduction over the ensuing 15 or 20 years. A
baseline census was planned and interviewers were recruited from the settlement to maximize acceptance and comprehension of the project. They
employed a structured, pretested questionnaire designed to describe a complete household on the basis of direct interview.

Despite preparatory contacts with
church leaders, confidence on the part
of the community was not sufficient to
permit completion of the census, and
the result was an unplanned 35-percent
“Sample Survey.” The Survey nevertheless seemed sufficiently representative to justify analysis.

In the pilot phase we had photographed vital records in several villages,
but these were both incomplete and
overlapping. While the Survey was proceeding, the Deacon of the M Colony
permitted our field worker, Kenneth
Barkman, to photograph the central
church recard books documenting the
approximately 3,500 families that have
resided in the colony since its founding.

These two principal independent
data sets, the Survey and the church records, were coded, placed on magnetic
tape, and thoroughly edited, including
for the church records comparison of information on many persons both as children and as heads of their own families.

Social Biology

From the 602 completed Survey records, 569 or 94 per cent were successfully matched to male heads of families
in the church records for crossvalidation and correction.

A third source of information was the
Land Survey or ‘‘Census” conducted by
the church for the provincial government in 1967 and based largely on village records. The Census recognized
1,737 extant families, of which 620 could
be identified with families or parts of
families in our Sample. The Census provided only four items: (1) family size, (2)
cultivated land, (3) pasturage, and (4)
head of cattle; but it served to document
size and wealth of villages and, at the
family level, to define some biases in the
Sample Survey.

The migration data reported here
were based on residence histories of the
569 male heads of household and their
558 living wives, including birthplace,
first residence after marriage, and any
other residence maintained for a year or
more, Map distances between villages
were available for the colonies in Chihuahua Province,

Vol. 34, No. 34

The unplanned sampling for the survey lent itself to evident biases, but
these biases do not appear to be serious
for the analysis of migration. An appearance of greater wealth in the Sample seems to be due to oversampling of
larger, older families; larger villages
were overrepresented both by inclusion
(Table 1) and by completeness of enumeration. Fifteen villages were omitted
and ten accounted for 67 per cent of the
households in the Sample. Geographically, most of the omitted villages were
in a nearly central area where we had
not recruited a primary interviewer, but
distances were not distorted; the mean
of the 45 distances among ten bestenumerated villages, 17.6 km., was very
similar to that of ten villages drawn at
random, 18.2 km.

The analysis of surnames is based entirely on the church records, which were
nearly complete for marriages. These
included the names, birth dates and
death dates of spouses, their date of
marriage, birthdates of their children,
and names of spouses’ four parents including maiden names of both mothers.
In many cases both spouses could be
traced to their families of orientation,
making available eight grandparents’
names.

MIGRATION MODELS

We did not include group migration
in the quantitative treatment. Migration
between divisions of the Old Colony
was analyzed mainly in terms of numbers of migrants, but migration within
the M Colony was analyzed by numbers,
years, and distance. The distance between birthplace of marriage partners,
or “marital distance,” is a useful mea~
sure of breeding isolation and was available for the Sample. A second quantity,
parent-offspring distance or individual

migration per generation, measures
gene-flow or dispersion, including group
migration, and is given in our data by
distance from birthplace of father to
present residence of the family. There
was relatively little movement after a
family became established.

Although marital distance and individual migration must ultimately have
the same consequences, they are not
alike in their distributions. Here, only
marital distance was found to fit the simple curve for exponential decay (Morton
and Yasuda, 1963):

m(x) = ce*, (1)

where m(x) is the probability, among all
marriages, that the distance is x, kis the
reciprocal of the mean distance, and c is
a constant. This is referred to as the aggregate distribution of marital distances
(Harrison and Boyce, 1972). Rather different results could be expected from
the average distribution, or after excluding village-endogamous marriages.

Both marital distance and individual
migration were compared with expected
random migration, i.e., mean distance
among villages in the M Colony, a
standard that is meaningful only in a geographically circumscribed population.
We used a sample of villages, unweighted by size.

MEASURES OF VILLAGE ENDOGAMY

An important component of average
marital distance is marriage within village. The village endogamy rate is
defined here as the proportion of married pairs in which partners share village
of birth. Under random mating within a
finite population, its expected value, Ep,
is a function only of village size, N; and
total population, N (counting N; and N
consistently, for example, as families).
The expectation is simply the probabil

ity of birth in a given village, squared to
express co-occurrence, and summed
over all villages:

Ey = 2(N/NP = 2(N?)/N*. (2)

A more appropriate formula for human populations with monogamy and
overlapping generations counts the
numbers of each sex:

Eo’ = 2M,F;/ MF, (3)

where M,; and F; are numbers of males
and females in the i” village; M and F
are total males and females. Since age
and marital state limit the available
mates, the values of M;, F;, M, and Fare
the numbers of persons actually appearing inacohort of N marriages, so that total males and females both equal N and

the denominator of Formula (3) be
comes N?.
ESTIMATION OF INBREEDING

On the assumption that in a small
population each surname was introduced by a single founding family with
parents unrelated to each other or to
other families, names can be regarded as
labels for genes inherited with them.
The importance of these assumptions is
considered in the Discussion.

Crow and Mange (1965) formulated
methods for inferring population levels
of inbreeding from the frequency of
“isonymy” (marriage between persons
of the same surname) and from the frequency distribution of names in the population. The probability of isonymous
marriage under random mating, P,, is
given by

P, = 2M F;/ MF = mF; (4)
resembling Formula (3), but where M;

and F; are the numbers of males and females with the ith surname; m; and f; are

the respective proportions within sex.
The coefficient of kinship between two
related persons is the probability that
two homologous genes selected from
them randomly will be derived from the
same ancestral gene; for parent and
child or for sibs, 6 = 0.25. The average
coefficient of kinship in the population is
estimated as one-fourth of P,:

b = Smif! 4. (5)

Average kinship () and frequency
of consanguineous marriage in one generation are algebraically related to inbreeding in the succeeding generation.
Total inbreeding, F, can be usefully partitioned into random and nonrandom
(i.e., deviation from random) components, F, and F,, (Allen, 1965; Crow and
Mange, 1965). When the observed frequency of isonymous marriages, P, is
not significantly different from the random value, P,, the nonrandom components of isonymy and inbreeding are insignificant, but P, and P, both divided by
four, estimate F, (= ) and F, respectively. A nearly equivalent method is
used here, as recommended by Crow
(1980) for old isolates, at least if the nonrandom component is significant. One
starts with the formula,

P, = (P-P,)(-P,), (6)

where P is the observed proportion of
isonymous marriages and P, is the proportion expected under random mating
within the given cohort, estimated by
Formula (4). F, and F, are estimated as
1/4 of P, and P,,, and when substituted
into Formula (7), they yield an estimate
of total inbreeding:

F=F,+F,-FF,. (7)

Vol. 34, No. 3-4

The effect of genetic drift is often
largest in the first generation of a new
isolate, when it is known as the founder
effect, as noted 1n the introduction. At
that point, the coefficient of kinship
takes an initial value, d9, which remains
the lower limit for subsequent generations, barring immigration. If there are
n founding families and 2n founding parents, the numerator in (5) is 2mf; = n(1/
n)* = 1/n, so from (5)

bo = 1/4n. (8)

In terms of genes, if there are 2n unrelated founding parents, the population starts with 4n haploid sets of chromosomes; 4n unrelated copies of each
gene. In subsequent generations ¢, the
probability of two random genes being
identical by descent, is at least hy and increases as some of the 4n genes are lost.
Similarly, as names are lost, estimates of
do based on remaining names will be
larger than the true founder effect. The
value of o from (5) increases even more
because loss of some names and drift of
frequencies tend to eliminate smaller
terms and increase larger ones. Conversely, immigration enlarges both n
and the gene pool and reduces &.

Having access to four parental surnames of nearly all couples in the church
records should permit detection of all
first-cousin marriages instead of onefourth of them as with spouses’ names,
but verification of cousinhood requires
identification of the isonymous grandparental pair or pairs by birthdates or at
least by first names. When parental
rather than spousal names are used in a
modification of (4), they appear to add
information about kinship (PintoCisternas et al., 1985; Allen, in press).

Old Colony Mennonites

171

Here we have used parental isonymy
(identity of surnames between either
parent of the husband and either parent
of the wife) only as a screening device in
searching for actual consanguinity and
to test quantitatively for any relation of
apparent inbreeding to marital distance.

RESULTS
MIGRATION

Immigration to the M Colony is summarized in Table 2. Canadian-born
adults in the Sample are all regarded as
founders; 99 per cent arrived before
1931. Fifty-three Mexican-born adults
are definite immigrants to the M Colony, but they all appear to have been
members of the Old Colony and none
contributed a unique surname.

Emigration from the M Colony was
estimated from the reports of absent living sibs collected from the men and
women in the Sample. Among 2,674 living full sibs of those born outside the M
Colony, mainly in Canada, 829 or 31 per
cent were reported to be in other Old
Colony settlements and 374 more, 14
per cent, were no longer counted in the
Old Colony, resulting in total emigration of 45 per cent. Of 4,776 sibs of men
and women born in the M Colony, many
were not yet married and the proportion
of emigrants was smaller, totaling 23 per
cent.

Migration within the M Colony can
be considered in three categories: (1) individual migration, (2) marital distance,
and (3) village endogamy.

Migration distances reported by men
who were born in the M Colony are
shown in Table 3. Men were counted as
nonmigrants for a given interval if they

were in the same village at start and
finish of the interval: birth to marriage
(i.e., to first marital residence), marriage to Survey date, or birth to Survey
date (‘“‘net migration’”’).

Table 3 shows a regular decrease
over time in the migration distances of
migrants and in the proportion migrating after marriage. In all three decades,
fewer men moved after marriage than
before, and for actual migrations, mean
distance moved after marriage was only
about half as great as mean distance
moved before marriage. The average
number of postmarital moves, not in the

table, decreased with time from 1.91 for
marriages before 1922, which included
the group migration from Canada, to
0.44 for marriages in the last 7 years before the Survey. For the intervening
decades the average was nearly constant: 1.00, 1.08, and 0.95. It thus appears that postmarital migration, excepting group migration, is largely
confined to the first 3 or 4 years after
marriage.

Migration before marniage, i.e., from
birthplace to first residence after marriage, was more frequent for women
than for men. Of 569 men, 171 or 30 per

cent settled after marriage in their birthplace. Among 527 first (i.e., firstidentified) wives still living, 126 or 24
per cent settled in their birthplace.
When 547 births before 1931 are excluded to eliminate group migration
from Canada, the figures are 45 per cent
and 33 per cent, respectively, a highly
significant difference between the sexes.

Among 382 Sample couples in which
the husband was born after 1921, in 287
cases the first-listed wife was still alive
and both partners were born in the M
Colony. For these men, net migration,
shown in the left half of Table 4, departed widely from the exponential decay curve, Equation (1), with excess at
short and long distances; 107 men or 37
per cent remained in the same village,
counted as a distance of 0.25 km. The fit
for a single decade, 1931—40, was hardly
better (Chi*s = 30.3) and an inverse
square function fitted less well. Mean
net distance for migrants in Table 4 was
16.7 km., close to the mean of ten villages drawn at random, 18.2 km. The fit
of postmarital migration to (1) was simi
lar to and worse than that of net migration despite a smaller mean, 9.4 km. for
migrants.

In contrast to individual or family migration, distance between birthplaces of
spouses, in the right half of Table 4, fits
Equation (1) rather well. Mean marital
distance was 10.4 km., s.d. 9.0 km. This
includes 45, or 16 per cent, villageendogamous marriages. For the other
242 marriages the average distance was
12.3 km.

Expected village endogamy under
random mating can be computed from
(2) when the size of all villages is known.
From the Census, 1,737 families in 45
villages yield the value E, = 0.025,
meaning that 2.5 per cent of random
marriages would be endogamous. Formula (3), employing given information
on sex and birthplace of married persons
in the Sample, yields higher expected
values as E,’. Table 5 shows the estimates of £’ obtained for four birth cohorts, ranging from 4.1 to 4.9 per cent.
The observed endogamy rates are
roughly proportional to the expected

from the frequency distribution of 80
surnames. No one birth cohort contained all 80 names, and after 1931 only
66 appear. Most of this loss occurred in
the 1920’s migration, not by slow genetic
drift. Eight names occurred only in female migrants from Canada, dying out
in Mexico.

Analyzed by Formula (5), kinship in
the first three cohorts (Table 6) is similar

P, o= F, Fy F
0.039 0.034 0.0086 0.0011 0.0097

at around o = 0.0086, while the last cohort registers an increase to about
0.0096. By the usual formula for the
standard error of a proportion applied
to P,, the last cohort does not differ
significantly from the others, but the frequency distributions, collapsed to eliminate expected frequencies less than 5,
yield a contingency Chi’,, of 145.4 (the
0.001 significance level would be about
101). The meaning of this finding will be
discussed below.

isonymous marriages is inevitably high
in a population with only 80 surnames of
which the six most frequent account for
36 per cent. Among the 3,398 first marriages, 107 were isonymous in the common sense; i.e., the wife’s maiden surname was the same as her husband’s
surname: “spousal isonymy.” As shown
in the last line of Table 6, the proportion, 0.031, is a little less than the 0.036
expected by chance, making the value of
F,, negative and implying avoidance of
inbreeding. Among the 107 cases of
isonymy, 56 could be traced to all grandparents, and first cousinhood was excluded. In seven instances a secondcousin relationship could also be ruled
out. In eight isonymous marriages that
were not traced to grandparents, the
spouses’ fathers also had the same first
names, so could not have been brothers
as required if the spouses were first cousins.

In 382 marriages the partners shared
a parental surname, ‘‘parental isonymy,” which includes cases of spousal

isonymy. Twelve couples exhibited double parental isonymy, in which four parents share two names as in a marriage of

double first cousins, and 19 couples exhibited compound isonymy, in which
three of the four parents share one
name. Consanguinity could not be investigated in all these marriages, but
rates of parental isonymy as defined
above could be estimated for four birth
cohorts, summarized in Table 7. Missing
husbands’ and wives’ maternal names
were taken into account by dividing the
isonymy rate by the proportion of maternal names known, a direct measure
of possible isonymies unless both maternal names are unknown in one family.
Thus corrected, the frequency of parental isonymy was 13.2 per cent.

From the Survey Sample, for which
birthplaces were known, among marriages of 287 men born in the M Colony,
38 couples, 13.2 per cent, showed parental isonymy. These 38 were all investigated for first-cousin marriage. Altogether, first cousins were ruled out in 91
isonymous marriages, second cousins in
nine of those.

Marriage between close relatives was
not found (or expected) in this population. If isonymy is nevertheless an indicator of consanguinity, isonymous coup

les in a geographically stable population
are expected to show an elevated rate of
village endogamy and a reduced average marital distance. From the data, endogamy was not elevated; average marital distance was reduced, but not
significantly so.

DISCUSSION

The present data illustrate the genetic consequences of strict religious
isolation and geographic subdivision in
inbreeding units similar to, but much
larger than, those found among the Hutterites (Steinberg et al., 1967). The subpopulation discussed here contained
over two thousand adults instead of
around a hundred. Genetic drift in a
population this size is expected to be
very slow, but our analysis of names and
isonymy provides evidence of substantial change associated with division and
migration. The number of husband and
wife surnames dropped from 79 in recorded marriages of men born before
migration to Mexico to 66 for men born
after the migration, and five of the lost
names were those of women born
around or before separation of the Old
Colony from other Mennonites; apparently their male sibs did not join. Both
observed and expected isonymy between spouses increased in marriages of
men born after migration, though not
significantly. A similar increase occurred, of course, in the derived coefficient of kinship.

The increase of inbreeding fails to
reach statistical significance, as expected for a random process. By definition, genetic drift and founder effects
result only from the operation of
chance. The value of 145 for contingency Chi’, contrasting the distributions of surnames before and after mi

gration, would be very highly significant
if accepted at face value, but it is not a
valid test of statistical significance because individual “trials” are not independent; each cohort contains blocks of
relatives, including large sibships.
Therein lies an important element of genetic drift and of the founder effect. Statistical significance is not expected in
one generation, but because direction of
change is determined by binomial sampling, significance is eventually attained.

It is doubtful if the founding population satisfied the requirements that all
families should have different names
and be unrelated. However, discrepancies of these two types tend to offset
each other in estimating the contribution of founder effect to present inbreeding, and at worst they impair precision in defining the generation when
inbreeding began. The assumptions are
not needed for estimating changes in inbreeding over time.

Since many early names undoubtedly
died out and are not seen in our records,
the minimum coefficient of kinship, oo,
as estimated by Formula (8) from observed surnames, is a combination of the
true founder effect and subsequent loss
of surnames accompanying incremental
genetic drift to 1890. With 107 known
ancestral names (103 from the church
records and 4 others from the Survey
and village records), the maximal
founder effect is 0.0023. Additional inbreeding is expressed in recent loss of
surnames and in the unequal distribution of surviving names, 0.0096 — 0.0023
= 0.0073.

Next to the founder effect, the portion of the inbreeding that can be best
estimated is that associated with the four
historical migrations. The move from
Canada to Mexico appears to have in

creased the kinship coefficient by 0.001.
At least two of the earlier mass migrations involved similar numbers (Sawatsky, 1971), so that four increments
of nearly this magnitude may have contributed 0.004 to the observed inbreeding:

Total random inbreeding 0.0096
Minus maximum founder effect 0.0023
Minus four migrations 0.0040
Remainder 0.0033

The remainder should be explainable
as gradual genetic drift. Through most
of its history, the Mennonite population
has been, by report, so large that the
random inbreeding effect would be
small. The increase in inbreeding is
1/2N, (N, is the effective population
number) per generation (Crow and Kimura, 1970). The Old Colony population in Chihuahua Province exceeded
20,000 in 1967, one-fourth of them
reproductive-age adults. An effective
population number of 5,000 over 16
generations would add only 0.0016 to
the inbreeding, so it appears that either
the harmonic mean number has been
much smaller, or the estimated total,
0.0096, is inflated, as expected if several
names Occurred in two or more founding families. A more detailed analysis is
found elsewhere (Allen, in press).

The population constriction associated with migration from Canada,
0.001, is four times that expected in one
generation of 2,000, the estimated number of married reproductive adults who
migrated from Canada. Inclusion of
large blocks of adult full sibs and adult
first cousins in that number would require a downward correction of the
number, This would not be sufficient
(Crow and Kimura, 1970) under the assumption of a mean progeny number of

Old Colony Mennonites 177

two, but that assumption does not apply
to this expanding population.

Isolation by distance is seen, first, in
immigration, which is inversely related
to distance between colonies: the Survey found 43, 7, and 0 migrants from the
other three colonies in Chihuahua Province. Second, the village boundary is a
strong barrier; 37 per cent of the married men born in Mexico still live in the
village where they were born and 14 per
cent of married couples were both born
in the same village. The second figure is
over four times that expected under random pairing.

The average male migration distance
within the colony is nearly equal to the
average distance between villages selected at random, but this must be interpreted in the light of a high rate of outmigration, possibly as high as 45 per
cent. Apparently a strong distance effect is outweighed within the colony by
pressure to migrate. The fit of marital
distance to an exponential decay curve
and failure of fit for migration distances

_ of individuals or couples appear to de
pend on the proportion of nonmigrants,
not on the relation between mean distance and dimensions of the colony.
Individual net migration history and
marital distance differ sharply in distribution curves, in proportion of migrants, and in mean distance. The explanation appears to be that these are
almost independent phenomena in this
population and perhaps in others
(Harrison and Boyce, 1972). The curve
of individual migration differs from exponential decay because of a high frequency of no migration and a nearly flat
frequency distribution for actual migration distances, as in some other studies
(e.g., Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1964). If a
man can obtain a farm in his own or his
new wife’s village, he generally will set

tle there. Otherwise he is forced to
search widely, and the Old Colony communication network is such that remote
villages are almost as likely as near ones
to come to his attention.

Marital distance has other determinants. Marriage is proscribed between
“known relatives,” who are likely to be
most frequent in a person’s own village.
This militates against village endogamous marriages. Yet courtship as practiced here requires social contact between partners (Redekop, 1969),
favoring residence in the same or a nearby village (Boyce et al., 1967).

Immigration from the other subdivisions shows a downward trend over
time, short of statistical significance.
Within the M Colony both marital distance and postmarital migration show
significant decline in successive cohorts.
One apparent explanation is increasing
population density, which would increase the number of available mates in
near villages, encourage emigration,
and impede relocation within the M
Colony. Another factor could be the
erosion over time of family and friendship ties that spanned the Old Colony
more widely just after migration to Mexico.

Social Biology

CONCLUSION

Despite a four-hundred-year history
of breeding isolation of their forebears,
the surname distributions of these Mennonites imply an inbreeding level of only
ob = 0.0096, below that in offspring of a
second-cousin marriage, 0.0156, and a
fraction of that reported for some Hutterites, 0.045 (Crow and Mange, 1965).
The M Colony is a semi-isolate within
the Old Colony, which in turn is an isolate within a semi-isolate, the Dutch
Mennonites. Recent records reveal 107
surnames, indicating a founder effect
possibly as great as 0.0023. The subsequent additional inbreeding must be ascribed to restricted population size,
mainly in mass migration events but also
during intervening generations.

The M Colony shows an inbreeding
increment of 0.001 after the migration to
Mexico in the 1920’s, four times that expected from the number of migrants.
The discrepancy may be due to large
blocks of sibs in an expanding population. Contingency Chi* appears to be a
useful instrument for specifying this
population structure in the comparison
of surname distributions of persons born
before and after the migration.
