Agricultural Organization and Fertility:

A Comparison of Two Philippine
Frontier Communities

ABSTRACT: The effect of agricultural organization on fertility is examined by a cross-sectional
analysis of data from two rural Philippine communities. Largely settled after World War II, both
communities began traditional subsistence farming. Over time one community has turned to
commercial farming. Contrary to expectations, no substantial differences between the two communities are found in fertility levels or in the relationship between socioeconomic status and
fertility. Status is negatively related to fertility in both communities, and most of its effect is
through age at marriage. In the community which has developed commercial agriculture, status
affects fertility after marriage, but then only slightly.

Fertility levels are lower in more developed nations than in less developed nations. -Furthermore, the experience of the
more developed countries has been that
fertility declines with modernization. Industrialization and urbanization with their
accompanying increased economic opportunities, higher levels of education, health,
and security, and reorganization of the
family are the major structural factors
cited as influencing the negative relationship between fertility and modernization
(Davis, 1967; Freedman, 1975; Heer,
1966; Hohm, 1975; Kasarda, 1971; Teitelbaum, 1975; United Nations, 1953).

Industrialization and urbanization have
therefore been proposed as the means by
which less developed nations can lower
their fertility levels and alleviate their
great population pressures. However,
time, resources, and market limitations
make industrialization unlikely in the near
future for most less developed countries.
And aggregation into cities can occur
without bringing the benefits which ac
crued to the industrialized nations (Breese,
1969; Hawley, 1971). If industrialization
and urbanization provide no feasible solution to the population problem in the near
future, just what can be done? Family
planning programs have been one attempt
to solve the problem; but as so well argued
by Davis (1967), such a response ignores
the social and economic structure that
influences reproductive motivation. Another possible solution is the reorganization of rural communities from traditional
subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture.

In the traditional subsistence agriculture found throughout the less developed
world, the family is the unit of production.
Its major source of power is the labor of
family members; its strength as a producing unit increases with its size (Hawley,
1950). The economic structure motivates
parents to have large numbers of children.
In commercial agriculture, farming becomes a business enterprise. The work of
machines replaces human labor, and chil

dren are no longer economic resources.
The rural areas develop greater communication with urban areas and experience a
concomitant rise in economic opportunity,
education, and health. To have a large
number of children becomes an economic
liability (Hawley, 1971; Mueller, 1972).
Additionally, commercial agriculture requires planning and greater regulation of
behavior in anticipation of future contingencies. It is necessary to routinize behavior on a schedule so that seeding, fertilizing, weeding, and spraying are executed in a determinative sequence. Such a
modern time orientation has been shown
to be directly related to fertility limitation
(Kahl, 1968; Keller, 1970).

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between economic
structure and fertility in rural communities of less developed nations by way
of a comparative analysis of two rural
communities in the Philippines, Magsaysay and Matanao. These two communities were selected to provide the research setting on the basis of their similarity in origin and their divergence in development. Both began relatively recently
with agricultural resettlement under circumstances favorable to community reorganization; but only Magsaysay developed
an economic structure of commercial agriculture.

Magsaysay and Matanao are contiguous
inland rural communities in Davao Province in southeast Mindanao. Each community contains approximately nine farm
localities (barrios) and one urban center
(poblacio) which are functionally interdependent. Until recently, Davao Province
was a frontier. Few people lived in the
area before World War II. Most of the
population arrived between 1948 and
1960, but inmigration has continued at a
slower rate since that time (Wernstedt and
Simkins, 1965; Hackenberg and Hackenberg, 1971). Initially the settlers replicated

Social Biology

the traditional community organization
and agricultural methods of their places of
origin. With time, the traditional farming
organization of Magsaysay evolved into a
modern one. By 1970, Magsaysay farmers
were engaged in commercial agriculture,
obtaining water, credit, seeds (including
the new varieties of the “Green Revolution”), fertilizer, insecticides, milling,
transportation, and sale of rice through
their cooperatives (Hackenberg, 1971;
Hackenberg and MHackenberg, 1971).
Matanao farmers, on the other hand, remained traditional, producing corn without modern technology or organization
(Hackenberg, 1971).

In the spring of 1970, household interviews were conducted with the male
and/or female head of every family living
in Magsaysay and Matanao. Information
was obtained on all individuals currently
living in the two communities and on the
residents’ children who moved away either
temporarily or permanently. This paper
confines itself to analysis of individuals
living in the two communities in 1970 and
in particular to the resident females over
the age of 15 years. The analysis is based
on the assumption that the original organization of Magsaysay and Matanao encouraged traditional high fertility with a
positive association between class and fertility as in the communities of emigration.
Furthermore, the analysis assumes that
such traditional organization was unlikely
to produce substantial differences between
the two communities in fertility levels and
in fertility differentials and that any differences between the two communities
which might now exist can be attributed to
the organizational changes which have occurred in Magsaysay. Successive surveys
will be taken of Magsaysay and Matanao
to provide longitudinal as well as crosssectional analysis to enable specification of
the timing and sequence of change.

By the time of our survey, seventeen

years after the founding of the initial
cooperative in Magsaysay, differences in
development of economic organization
had been followed by small changes in
other parts of the social and economic
structure. Income and land distribution
tended to be more inequitable in Matanao,
reflecting its traditional structure. Although mean income per household was
similar for the two communities (approximately 1,630 pesos), there was a greater
concentration of households in the lower
income categories in Matanao than in
Magsaysay. Over one-half of the households in Matanao received 749 pesos or
less a year, while only 35.8 per cent in
Magsaysay had incomes that low. During
settlement of Davao Province, each migrant farmer received an average of 4.047
hectares, but equitable distribution of land
did not last. Average size of owned farm
increased by 1970 to 6.0 hectares in Magsaysay and 8.5 hectares in Matanao. Still,
the majority of cultivated land in both
Magsaysay and Matanao (71 per cent) remained tilled by owners. There was
slightly more tenantry in Matanao than in
Magsaysay, 57.0 per cent compared to
51.7 per cent, plus 5 per cent partowners/part-tenants in each.

Magsaysay farmers invested more in
both basic farm equipment (carabao,
plow, and insecticide sprayer) and mechanical farm equipment (hand tractor,
thresher, or other machine) than did
Matanao farmers. Possession of modern
household objects, however, was similar
in the two communities.

No differences existed between Magsaysay and Matanao in educational attainment of their populations. On the
average, residents of both communities
tended to complete primary school. This
average disguises changes over time.
Older residents who were educated prior
to their inmigration averaged three years
of schooling, while younger residents

Two Philippine Communities

71

tended to complete eight years of schooling. The lack of educational differences
between the two communities can be attributed to external sources of change.
Besides modernizing influences being
brought to Magsaysay by commercial agriculture, the national government has
been extending roads, health services, and
elementary education to rural areas including both Magsaysay and Matanao.
Also, religious orders have been establishing high schools in rural areas. Thus, despite differences in economic structure,
Magsaysay and Matanao have an equal
number of elementary and high schools,
educating approximately the same number
of children.

Differences existing between Magsaysay
and Matanao in income and land distribution and in farm equipment are only
small, and no differences exist in education or in possession of modern objects.
Any innovation, such as a new economic
structure, will take time to mature, time
for its effects to reverberate throughout
the system. Many effects are cumulative
and only apparent after a number of years.
We expect greater structural differences to
become manifest in the future. For the
present, any differences found in fertility
may be attributed to the organization of
commercial agriculture rather than to the
higher standard of living which commercial agriculture is expected to eventually
bring.

One might hypothesize that the organization of agriculture does not affect fertility, but rather that a third variable causes
both the development of commercial agriculture and reduced fertility. There are
two candidates for this third variable: type
of crop and composition of settlers. The
primary crop is rice in Magsaysay and
corn in Matanao. However, it is unlikely
that type of crop could account for any
fertility differences which might be found,
since differences in cultivation of these
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

72 Hiday

two crops have not produced fertility differences in other parts of the Philippines or
the less developed world.

The majority of settlers in each community came from the Visaysan Islands
where dry corn cultivation is the prevailing type of traditional agriculture. However, in Magsaysay, a small group (18 per
cent of immigrants) originated in Ilocos
Norte where wet rice cultivation predominates. To establish the traditional wet rice
cultivation of their homeland, the Ilocanos had to transform their kin-based
irrigation association, the zanjera, into a
community coalition, since individuals
migrated without their kin group and
since Illocano homesteads were not contiguous. Thus, Magsaysay and Matanao
did not share a crucial element in their
early development. We propose, however,
that this innovative force alone would not
have been sufficient to produce fertility
differences, had it not been successful in
producing higher yields, in bringing the
Visayans into the coalition, and in evolving into a community organization for
commercial agriculture. The Illocanos
were not distinct from the Visayans in any
other crucial respect.

We hypothesized that fertility would be
lower in Magsaysay where commercial
agriculture has developed than in
Matanao where traditional subsistence
farming has become entrenched. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the association between measures of socioeconomic status and fertility would be positive in Matanao, reflecting its traditional
organization, and would be negative in
Magsaysay, reflecting its modernized economic structure. But because changes in
organizational form take time to work
their way through a system, the fertility
behavior of the Magsaysay population
may reflect that of a society in the process
of transition; that is, there may be no association between socioeconomic status

and fertility. We shall first compare fertility levels of the two communities and then
fertility differentials within each community.

A note of caution should be inserted.
These data on total number of live births
do not include the fertility of women who
died or who left Magsaysay and Matanao.
If these excluded women systematically
differ in fertility from those surveyed, our
reports of community fertility will be
biased. We have no way of checking this
possible bias. Another problem is that of
underreporting of live births which will be
more likely in the cases where a child died
or left home and where the woman was
older. To reduce underreporting because
of poor recall, interviewers obtained a list
of all pregnancies by type of termination
and employed probing in checking the list.

COMPARATIVE FERTILITY RATES

The 1969 crude birth rates of Magsaysay and Matanao are high, 42.6 and
41.6 per 1,000 respectively. Magsaysay
has lower marital fertility than Matanao
(306.8 to 320.7), but has a higher general
fertility rate (227.7 to 221.0), and childwoman ratio (1,070.0 to 976.6) than
Matanao. The higher general fertility rate
and child-woman ratio of Magsaysay can
be explained by its larger proportion married, particularly at the younger ages.
These differences can be seen as well in
the age-specific fertility rates (Table 1).
Fertility for all women is greater in
Matanao than in Magsaysay except at ages
less than twenty and between ages 30 and
34. Marital fertility is greater in Matanao
for all age groups but that of women between 30 and 34. The difference in allwomen and married-women fertility rates
at ages less than 20 years is explained by
the greater proportion not married in these
ages in Matanao (see Table 2). Almost 90
per cent of women between 15-19 years

per cent in this age group are unmarried in
Magsaysay.

Total fertility rates for married women
in both Magsaysay and Matanao are
greater than the cumulative fertility of
married women who have completed their
reproductive years, even greater than the
cumulative fertility of women who married before the age of 20 years (see Table
3). Total fertility is generally higher than
cumulative fertility because it assumes no
deaths through the reproductive ages. But
this difference coupled with the higher
cumulative fertility of women 40-44 suggests that younger women are having a
greater number of births within younger

age spans than did older women at comparable ages. If younger women maintain
the 1969 age-specific rates as they pass
through their reproductive years, their
completed fertility will be greater than
women who completed their fertility in
1969. Undoubtedly, improved health is
reducing fetal loss and infant mortality,
thereby increasing the number of reported
live births. Also, improved health is reducing the number of maternal deaths, permitting more women to live to reproduce.
Unless younger women curtail their
childbearing in the later years, fertility
will increase in both Magsaysay and
Matanao.

tween the ages of 25 and 29 in both communities. Though fertility declines with
age thereafter, it remains relatively high in
the advanced ages of the reproductive period. Peak fertility of Magsaysay and
Matanao women in 1969 represents a
five-year upward change from rural peak
fertility found by Hawley in 1952 (Hawley, 1955); but it matches the years of peak
fertility reported for all the Philippines in
1960 and 1968 (Lorimer, 1966; Flieger,
1972).

The proportion of women not married
by 19 years of age was over half in both
Magsaysay and Matanao among the early
migrants, reflecting the single male migrant pattern prior to 1950. The proportion
not married by 19 declined with later
groups. In 1969, however, this proportion
appeared to be increasing among women
in their twenties in both communities following the recent trend of rising age at
marriage apparent throughout the Philippines (Flieger, 1972).

Only 10.6 per cent of women less than
19 years of age are married in Magsaysay.
At ages 20-24, 56.3 per cent in Matanao
and 69.5 per cent in Magsaysay are married. In the peak childbearing years 25-29,
almost 9 out of every 10 women in each
community are married. The per cent ever
married at all ages is greater for both

Matanao and Magsaysay than it is for the
Philippines as a whole, except for Matanao women under 20 years who have
the same proportion married as the nation
(Smith, 1975). Although Matanao has a
larger proportion not married, Magsaysay
has a larger proportion not married until
after the teen years.

There is a clear difference in reproductive histories between women marrying
before the age of 20 years and those marrying afterwards (Table 3). By the end of the
reproductive period (ages =50), women
who married at 20 years of age or later
have an average of 2.6 fewer births in
Magsaysay and 1.5 fewer births in Matanao. Because of the increased proportion marrying after 19 years of age,
declines can be expected in future fertility;
and because the proportion is larger in
Magsaysay than in Matanao, larger fertility declines can be expected in Magsaysay.
Perhaps this trend to later marriage and
lower fertility will cancel the high fertility
expectations associated with their agespecific fertility rates.

tion, husband’s occupation, husband’s
land tenure, and household income. We
shall first explore the relationship between
each individual socioeconomic measure
and fertility with a control for age. This
will be followed by a multivariate analysis
of all socioeconomic variables on marital
fertility controlling for both age and age at
marriage.

Table 4 presents total live births per
woman by woman’s education. Educational categories are collapsed in this table
for greater clarity, In both Magsaysay and
Matanao a modern pattern is observed
showing decreasing fertility with education when age is controlled (6 < 0.001).
Most of the impact of education seems to
be occurring in the early reproductive
years. Childbearing is postponed with
more education. In these data there is no
evidence of fertility’s being curtailed in the
later reproductive years.

Household income is measured as income of all family members from all crop
sales, wages and salaries, sales of farm
animals, rentals, tenant shares received,
trading, sari-sari store sales, money lending with interest, pensions, money sent
home by relatives, and any other incoming
cash. The value of crops raised and consumed at home is not included in our mea
sure as the reliability of that information is
questionable. As with education, income
categories are collapsed for clearer presentation.

Table 5 presents data on cumulative
fertility and household income among respondents. When income is grouped into
four categories as in this table, a modern
pattern emerges among the younger women. At ages less than 25 years, there is a
clear inverse association between fertility
and income in both Magsaysay and
Matanao; but among women older than 24
years of age in Magsaysay and women
older than 35 years in Matanao, no clear
pattern emerges. When household income
is not grouped, the relationship between
fertility and the full distribution of income
is negative but nonsignificant in Magsaysay and significantly negative in Matanao (p < 0.01).

Before viewing fertility by husband’s
occupation (Table 6), we should note that
data are thin in the professional/merchant
category. Most of the age groups in this
category contain fewer than ten women.
Despite this shortcoming, a consistent
though nonsignificant pattern of variation
can be observed in Magsaysay. Total
number of live births per woman is highest

professional/merchant class. In Matanao
the inverse pattern is not as clear since the
nonfarm skilled and unskilled class at ages
under 30 years has higher fertility than the
farming class.

When farming families alone are observed and women are categorized by
husband’s farm tenure (Table 7), a negative association between fertility and socioeconomic status is found among women
of both communities (o> < 0.001 in Magsaysay, P < 0.01 in Matanao). Members
of the highest category of farm tenure,
owner/owner tenants, have the lowest fer
tility. Because of the small number in the
farm laborer category, caution should be
used in any generalizations.

Contrary to expectations, both communities demonstrate a modern pattern of
class differences in fertility when education and land tenure are separately used as
indicators of socioeconomic status and age
is controlled. Although a tendency toward
an inverse association between fertility
and the other two indicators of class, husband’s occupation and income, is apparent
in our data, only income in Matanao holds
significance.

To discern the importance of each socioeconomic variable on fertility, all four
socioeconomic variables were included at
once in a multiple regression analysis.
None of the zero-order correlations between the socioeconomic variables are
above 0.50, so multicollinearity is not
problematic. Because age at marriage affects cumulative fertility and because our
socioeconomic variables might be operating on fertility only indirectly through age
at marriage, marriage age is controlled as
well as chronological age in the regression
equation

Table 8 presents the regression coefficients, beta weights, multiple correlations, and explained variance for the effect of socioeconomic variables on the fertility of all currently married women in
Magsaysay and Matanao Most of the explained variance in cumulative fertility is
accounted for by age and marital age In
Matanao no socioeconomic variables maintain significance, all explained variance is accounted for by age and age at
marriage. The earlier significance of
woman’s education and household income
in Matanao disappears when age at mar

riage is controlled suggesting that these
two socioeconomic variables operate on
fertility only by delaying marriage and
causing a reduction in early childbearing.
In Magsaysay, on the other hand, household income and woman’s education are
significant (6 < 0.001), though they explain only a small proportion of the variance in cumulative fertility. Woman’s
education in Magsaysay appears to negatively affect fertility both directly after
marriage and indirectly by raising the age
at marriage. However, income is left with
a positive effect when the influence of age
at marriage 1s controlled. Husband’s occupation, though negative, is nonsignificant.

The picture was similar when only farm
families were observed and tenure was
substituted for husband’s occupation in
the multiple regression equation. Age and
age at marriage accounted for most of the
explained variance in the cumulative fertility of married women in Magsaysay (45
per cent, p < 0.001), and all of the explained variance in Matanao (46 per cent,
p < 0.001). In Magsaysay, education and
tenure were negatively associated with
cumulative fertility (@ < 0.05, p < 0.01
respectively). The greater the number of
years of schooling and the tenure status,
the smaller the number of children borne
by each age and marriage age group. On
the other hand, income was positively associated with cumulative fertility as it was
in the total group of married women (p <
0.001).

Not only have the differences in agricultural organization between the two rural
communities not produced any substantial
differences in fertility levels, they have not
produced substantial differences in the
way socioeconomic variables affect fertility. In both Magsaysay and Matanao
woman’s education, income, and land tenure negatively affect fertility indirectly
through age at marriage. However, at this

Social Biology

time in Magsaysay, the replacement of
traditional subsistence agriculture by
commercial farming shows effects only on
the relationship between socioeconomic
variables and fertility after marriage, and
those effects are quite small.

SUMMARY

Contrary to expectations, Magsaysay
and Matanao, with similar origins but divergent development, were not found to
differ in their fertility. Both communities
have high fertility. Direct effects of modernization such as improved health and
reduced mortality, which immediately increase fertility, are being experienced by
both Magsaysay and Matanao through the
efforts of the national government. It is
possible that these direct effects are overwhelming any indirect effects of modernization such as increased knowledge and
increased cost of children which tend to
reduce fertility. It is also possible that at
this early stage of commercial agriculture,
which is still dependent on labor-intensive
cultivation and not yet producing substantial increases in income, the value of
children does not change. Perhaps only at
more advanced stages of commercial agriculture do mechanization and consumption cause children to be revalued. Trends
to higher educational achievement and
later age at marriage, coupled with negative associations between fertility and
education and between fertility and age at
marriage, suggest that fertility will be reduced in the future. However, such a
change will require a reduction of fertility
at older ages, since the data suggest the
younger women are presently experiencing
higher fertility than older women did in
their younger years.

A modern pattern of fertility declining
with socioeconomic status has appeared in
both Magsaysay and Matanao. Status affects fertility indirectly through age at

marriage. Fertility is being reduced in the
early reproductive years by higher status
women who delay marriage. Socioeconomic differences within communities ap
pear to be having a greater effect at this .

stage than do organizational differences
between communities. However, small
differences between Magsaysay and Matanao were found in the effect of socioeconomic status on fertility after marriage.
In Matanao, fertility shows no effect from
socioeconomic status once age at marriage
is controlled. But in Magsaysay, where
important organizational change is occurring, education and tenure status have
significant, though small, negative effects

on fertility when marriage age is controlled. Jf modernizing influences continue
to accumulate in response to innovation,
we would expect the next survey to register significant decreases in fertility and increasing fertility differentials by socioeconomic status in Magsaysay.
