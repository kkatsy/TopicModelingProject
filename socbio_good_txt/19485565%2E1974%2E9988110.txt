San Diego Biomedical Symposium

The San Diego Biomedical Symposium
will be held February 5-7, 1975, at the
Hilton Inn on Mission Bay, San Diego,
California. The symposium will continue
last year’s topic “Innovations in Biomedicine.”

Organized in 1960 as the San Diego
Symposium for Biomedical Engineering,
the annual symposium has traditionally

focused on interdisciplinary topics in medical, biological, and engineering technologies. The primary objective is to stimulate
interaction among life and physical scientists and practicing physicians.

Further information can be obtained by
