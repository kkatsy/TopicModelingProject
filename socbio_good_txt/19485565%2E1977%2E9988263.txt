ABSTRACT: In a sample of 51 like-sex DZ twin pairs (22 male, 29 female) 49 quantitative traits
were analyzed for association with, and linkage to, each of 7 informative blood systems. Nine
associations were found to be significant at the 0.01 level, and a further 27 significant at the 0.05
level, whereas the numbers expected to be significant by chance alone are about 3 and 17
respectively. The most consistent associations are those of Rh with the scores obtained with Paul
Griéger’s characterological test. The associations may be due to a factor present in the physical or
social environment that influences both characteristics simultaneously; alternative explanations
are pleiotropy, epistasis, or heterogeneity of the populations. Only 12 of the tests for linkage were
significant at the 0.05 level, less than would be expected by chance alone; these results are
therefore inconclusive. The most significant linkage is that between Hp and activity, one of the 3
scores in Griéger’s characterological test. In vew of independent data suggesting evidence of
linkage between Hp and depression spectrum disease, further study of this possible linkage in

larger families would be warranted.

In the field of quantitative inheritance,
two different approaches can be used to
make inferences about the nature of the
genetic control of a given quantitative trait

.when genetically defined polymorphic sys
tems are studied simultaneously. One approach looks for possible associations between the differences found in the
monogenic and polygenic systems; a
second searches for linkages between the
genes responsible for them.

The methods needed for these analyses
were recently developed by Haseman and
Elston (1972). Inexpensive and efficient,
they have already been successfully
applied to a sample of dizygotic (DZ) twins
(Pakstis et al., 1972). Therefore, it seemed
worthwhile to test the relationships be

tween the variation found in a series of
genetic markers with those present in
morphological and behavioral characteristics occurring in another independent
sample of extensively studied DZ twins
(Da Rocha et al., 1972; Callegari et al.,
1972a, b; Pena et al., 1973; Telles da Silva
et al., 1976; Salzano and Rao, 1976).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample consists of 51 DZ twin pairs
(22 male and 29 female pairs). The twins
were located primarily through inquiries
at high schools and through informants.
All the twins were from Porto Alegre,
Brazil, except for two pairs, both male,
who were from nearby cities. Two male
pairs were classified as Negroid; the rest,
white. Zygosity diagnosis was made using
the blood groups ABO, Rh (tests with
anti-C, C¥, c, D, E, e), MNSs, P, Duffy,

and Kell, ABH secretion, and serum haptoglobins. All 102 individuals were typed
for all eight systems. Kell was virtually
uninformative for these analyses.
Additional details about the data
collection can be obtained in the papers
mentioned at the end of the introduction.

Forty-nine quantitative traits were analyzed for association with, and linkage to,
each of the seven informative blood systems. A transformation of the type y = x”,
where y is defined to be log x when p = 0,
was applied to each trait to reduce the
skewness of its distribution in the sample.
Table 1 gives a list of the traits measured,

the value of p used in each transformation,
and the number of twin pairs measured for
each trait. Table 2 gives the number of
individuals in each phenotypic marker
class.

Association between the phenotypes of
each polymorphic marker system and each
trait measure was tested by a simple oneway analysis of variance, the number of
classes being equal to the number of different phenotypes for the marker system.
Since the sibling relationship was ignored
in this analysis, and since siblings will
tend to be more similar than random
members of the population for all phenotypic traits (for both genetic and environmental reasons), significant association
found by this test does not necessarily
imply pleiotropy. Lack of significant association on the basis of such a test,
however, does imply that if the activity
measure is partially determined by a locus
linked to the marker locus, then there is no
significant linkage disequilibrium between
the two loci.

Using the method given by Haseman
and Elston (1972), linkage was sought by
regressing the squared twin-pair differ
Social Biology

ence for a trait on the estimated proportion
of genes identical by descent that the twin
pair shares at a given locus. A significant
negative regression, in the absence of association between the activity measure
and the marker phenotypes, is indicative
of linkage. Since squared differences cannot be normally distributed, and since the
sample size is relatively small, the squared
differences were also subjected to the
transformation y = x”, the value of p being
chosen (in an iterative fashion) so as to
make the skewness of the residuals from
the regression model approximately zero.
This procedure is valid (Blackwelder, unpublished) and makes Student’s f-test for
regression robust in this situation. Spearman’s rank correlation test between the
squared differences and the estimated
proportion of genes identical by descent
was also performed.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

ASSOCIATION

Nine prior associations between the 7
markers and the 49 traits were found to be
significant at the 0.01 level (Table 3) and a
further 27 significant at the 0.05 level
(Table 4). The numbers expected to be
significant by chance alone are about 3
and 17, respectively, if we ignore the fact
that the data are in the form of sib pairs.

Details of the associations significant at
the 0.01 level are given in Table 5. It is

doubtful whether the sib-pair nature of the
data would cause a threefold increase in
the number of expected significant associations, so at least some of these associations are probably not spurious.

The most consistent results are the associations of Rh with the scores obtained
with Paul Griéger’s characterological test.
This and the other associations may be
due to a factor present in the physical or
social environment that influences both
characteristics simultaneously; alternative
explanations are pleiotropy, epistasis, or
heterogeneity of the populations. It is
difficult to envisage a factor that could
simultaneously influence the Rh gene distribution and the behavioral characteristics of our subjects, since Rh incompatibility, for instance, is an event too rare to
affect significantly the other trait. The hypothesis of pleiotropy or epistasis cannot
be tested with our data.

As for population heterogeneity, the 49
Caucasian and 2 Negroid pairs of twins
seem to be fairly representative of members of these ethnic groups living in Porto
Alegre. The Blacks show signs of admixture (one pair being classified as light
mulatto and the other as dark mulatto).
All parents and grandparents of 10 of the
49 white pairs were of Portuguese ancestry, with no indication of admixture with
persons from other nationalities. The ancestors of 19 others were also predominantly Portuguese, but at least one grandparent or more remote ancestors were
from other European nationalities. The
ancestry of the remaining 20 pairs can be
characterized as follows: (a) at least two
Italian grandparents, 8; (b) at least two
German grandparents, 4; (c) Jewish, 4;
(d) other nationalities, 4. Heterogeneity,
therefore, is definitely present. We are not
certain, however, if the genetic variation

12 regressions were found to be significantly negative at the 5 per cent level
(one-sided t-tests), and in 13 cases
Spearman’s rank correlation was found to
be similarly significantly negative. The 8
cases in which both tests gave a result
significant at the 5 per cent level are
shown in Table 6. Since the number of
significant results is less than the one expected by chance, this listing is given
solely in case any one of these should later
be reported as suggestive of a linkage
relationship in another study. Of these 8
cases, only one also showed significant association, that of the MNSs system and
numerical ability. The most significant
possible linkage found is that between Hp
and activity, and it is interesting to note
that data from Tanna et al. (1976) suggest
linkage, using Penrose’s sib-pair method,
between Hp and depression spectrum
disease. It would be worthwhile to test
relatives of persons with this disease, as
well as individuals showing the first signs
of it with Griéger’s questionnaire. New
Hp studies in families investigated in this
way would serve to further define the

relationships between this marker, the
characterological traits, and the disease
factors.

Results such as those obtained here
should be considered only as suggestive of
linkages which may be looked for in
family studies applying the method of
Elston and Stewart (1971). It should also
be recognized that for the purpose of linkage analysis a sample size of 51 twin pairs
is relatively small and would hardly be
expected to lead to any definitive results.
