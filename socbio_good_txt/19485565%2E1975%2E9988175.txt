Although there have been numerous
investigations of the relationships between sibling constellation variables and
intelligence, we still do not have a very
clear understanding of how birth order
and family size are related to intellectual
performance. Our lack of understanding is
primarily due to the serious methodological and statistical shortcomings of much
of the research that has been undertaken
so far.

When examining relationships between
birth order and intelligence, investigators
have generally restricted their samples to
include two categories, first-borns and
later-borns. Birth order research has also
seldom taken into account other relevant
variables, such as family size, social class,
family density, and maternal age. Another
limitation of sibling research has been the
use of inadequate samples. Often the samples have been too small to allow sufficient numbers of families of different sizes
to be included and too small to achieve
sufficient numbers of individuals from
different birth-order positions. Also, there
have been few studies which have examined completed or nearly completed families.

However, inconsistent and inconclusive

results have been produced even from
those few studies that have attempted to
overcome some of the mentioned methodological limitations. Using data on approximately 43,000 American high-school students from the Project Talent study,
Burton (1968) found that there were no
consistent birth-order differences in intelligence test scores among socioeconomic
categories and among family-size groupings. In a sample of 500 11-year-old Irish
children, Kellaghan and Macnamarra
(1972) found that social status, family
size, and birth order all made significant
contributions to differences in verbal
reasoning scores, while in a survey of 700
15-year-old English students Murray
(1971) discovered that after controlling
for the effects of family size and social
status, there were no significant differences between first-borns and later-borns
on verbal and nonverbal tests.

In one of the most extensive sibling
constellation studies yet undertaken, Belmont and Marolla (1973), using a conservative statistical analysis, found that in
a sample of nearly 400,000 19-year-old
Dutch males, birth order and family size
had independent relationships with intellectual performance. The relationships be

tween family size and intelligence were
not found to be present in all social classes,
but the relationships between birth order
and intelligence were constant across social
classes.

The findings from the above studies
remain equivocal primarily because they
have relied on the use of restricted statistical techniques. They have used productmoment correlations which reveal only bivariate relations and analysis of variance
which requires the grouping of variables
into levels. Simple additive multiple regression models have been used to examine how much extra variance in intelligence test scores is associated with the
addition of sibling variables to the regression equations. However, the results
generated from these regression equations
rely on the order in which the sibling
variables have been added to the equations. Thus, all of these statistical techniques have prevented the full character
of the relationships of sibling variables,
social class, and intelligence from being
revealed.

_ One of the few pieces of sibling research

to use complex statistical models found
that hyperbolic regression equations including father’s occupation, the inverse of
the size of the family, and the product of
these two variables accounted for as much
significant variance in verbal and number
ability scores as complex many-termed
equations containing other sibling and
social status variables, their quadratics
(to test for nonlinearity), and their products (to test for interactions). However,
the latter research was restricted by the
use of a small sample and, in part, by the
order in which the variables were entered
into the regression models (Marjoribanks
and Walberg, 1975a, 1975).

In the present study, an attempt is
made to overcome both the methodological

and Walberg Social Biology
and statistical shortcomings of previous
sibling research. Complex multiple regression models are used to examine the relationships among the birth order, family
size, social class, and the intelligence test
scores of the Dutch males investigated in
the Belmont and Marolla (1973) research.
The nature and the size of the sample,
approximately 400,000 19-year-olds, allows many of the methodological restrictions of previous research to be eliminated,
while many of the statistical limitations
are overcome by constructing regression
surfaces from regression models which include terms to account for the possible
interaction and curvilinear relationships
among intelligence, family size, birth order, and social class.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As reported in the Belmont and Marolla
study, the sample consisted of approximately 400,000 19-year-old men. They
represented nearly all male survivors of
children born in the Netherlands from
1944 to 1947, who were still living in the
Netherlands at the time they reached 19
years of age. It is reasonable to assume
that virtually all of their respective families were complete at that time.

When they reached the age of 19, the
men were required to complete a battery
of tests as part of an examination to determine their fitness for military training. In
the present study, the scores from the
Raven Progressive Matrices (Dutch modification with 40 items) are used. The raw
scores from the test were grouped by the
Dutch military into six classifications. In
the present analysis, the scores range from
a low of 1 to a high score of 6.

Social class data are based on father’s
occupation at the time of the military
examination and have been classified into
three social groups: nonmanual (professionals and white-collar workers); man

ual (skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled
workers); and farm (farmers and farm
laborers).

Family size is classified into nine categories. Category one represents a onechild family, category two indicates a
family with two children, and so on, to
category eight which represents a family
of eight children. Category nine indicates
a family with nine or more children. Birth
order is also classified into nine categories,
with category one representing a first-born
child, and so on, with category eight indicating that the subject was the eighth child
born into the family. Category nine indicates that the subject’s birth order in the
family was either ninth or greater than
ninth. The final sample included 386,114
19-year-old males who had data on birth
order, family size, social class, and scores
on the intelligence test.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

One of the oldest theories in sibling
research claims that an only child in a
family is different from all children with
siblings. In some sense, only children can
as justifiably be classified youngest as
oldest. Because of the difficulty of classification, many investigators have excluded
only children from their analyses while
others have treated them as first-borns. In
preliminary analyses of the Dutch data, we
found that when singletons were included,
mental ability scores could not be very
well fitted to family size. However, when
the singletons were excluded from the
analysis, there was a quadratic fit between ability scores and family size. We
found that the scores for the singletons
were much lower than we would have
predicted. The results suggest a cautious
and tentative speculation, that a number
of the single-borns may have been mentally deficient at birth, which influenced
the parents not to have further children.

Birth Order and Intelligence

263

Because we found the singletons to be an
exceptional case, we removed them from
the remainder of the analysis.

In the first analysis (excluding singletons), multiple regression models are
used which include the intelligence scores
as the criterion variable with the predictors being social class, family size,
birth order, the squares of the sibling
variables, and the products of the predictors. The relationships between the
predictor variables and the intelligence
scores are examined in terms of the significance of raw regression weights rather
than the significance of standardized regression weights (see Table 1). As Schoenberg (1972, p. 4) suggests, when different
subsamples are being compared, as in the
present study, then: “It is simply not legitimate to compare standardized measures
across different samples since any difference in such measures may just as likely
be attributable to differences in variances
as to differences in effects.”

The significance of the relations between the predictors and the intelligence
scores is determined by evaluating the
absolute value, |é|, of the ratio of the raw
regression weight (0), to its standard error (€). In the present study, the 5 per
cent critical value for |£| is 1.960 while the
1 per cent critical value is 2.576 (see
Draper and Smith, 1966).

The results shown in Table 1 indicate
significant relationships between social
class and intelligence test scores and also
significant linear and quadratic relationships among family size, birth order, and
intelligence. Also, the intelligence scores
are related to family-size and birth-order
interactions with social class. The significant interaction terms in Table 1 show
that the slopes of the mental ability scores
on family size and birth order differ in the
three social class groups. Therefore, we

examined separately the relationships of
intelligence scores, family size, and birth
order within each of the three social class
groups.

For the separate analysis in each social
class, group regression models were used
which included as predictors: family size,
birth order, and the product and squares
of the two sibling variables. The findings
in Table 2 show that between the social
class groups, family size and birth order
have differential relationships with the
intelligence test scores. For example, in
the nonmanual and manual social groups,
family size and birth order are related to
intelligence, while in the farm social
group, family size is not related to intelligence. Intelligence is related to the square
of birth order in the manual and farm
groups and related to the square of family
size in the nonmanual social class group.
The interaction between family size and
birth order was not related to the intelligence scores in any of the social class
groups.

From the results presented in Table 2,
a set of regression surfaces were constructed to show the linear and quadratic
relationships of family size, birth order,
and intelligence within each social class
group (see Figures 1, 2, and 3). The

curvature of each surface indicates that,
within each social class group, as birth
order increases there is a gradual decline
in the intelligence test scores. However,
in the manual (Fig. 2) and farm (Fig. 3)
social groups, the curvilinear relationship
between birth order and intelligence is
such that the successive decrements in test
scores become smaller as birth order increases, while in the nonmanual (Fig. 1)
group the successive decrements in intelligence become greater as birth order
increases.

The relationships between family size
and intelligence for the nonmanual and
manual social class groups, shown in Figures 1 and 2, support previous research
(eg., Anastasi, 1956; Cicirelli, 1967;
Nisbet and Entwistle, 1967; Record et al.,
1969; Douglas, 1968; Kennett and Cropley, 1970) which has shown that the relationship between family size and intellectual performance is attenuated as the socioeconomic status of families increases. For
example, the present results indicate that
the intelligence test scores of children
from quite small families within the manual social class group are lower than test
scores of children from large families
within the nonmanual social class group.
Such a finding provides the possible basis

for a partial explanation of the results of
an investigation of British university
graduates by Poole and Kuhn (1973).
They found that for university graduates
with a middle class background a relatively large family does not constitute a
barrier to educational achievement, whereas for the son or daughter of a manual
worker a small family of one or two children is virtually a precondition of educational success in the form of a university
degree.

The results of the present study emphasize the complexity of the interrelationships of social class, birth order, fam
ily size, and intelligence. Previous sibling
research has tended to concentrate on the
investigation of either birth order or family size rather than both together, and
much of the research has failed to consider the influence of these two variables
within different social class groups. By
using complex multiple regression models
to construct regression surfaces, the present study has been able to overcome many
of the limitations of prior investigations
and has led to a greater understanding of
the relations between sibling variables and
intelligence.

models have been used, the findings have
depended on the order in which measures
of family size, birth order, and social class
have been added to the equations. By using raw regression weights as the basis of
analysis, the present study has allowed
the full nature of the interrelations of
family size, birth order, and intelligence
in different social class groups to be examined. Whereas many previous studies have
concluded that sibling variables have low
to moderate linear relationships with intelligence, the present results suggest that
when curvilinear, interaction, and linear
relationships are analyzed, then both family size and birth order have sizable differential relationships with intelligence in
different social class groups.

SUMMARY

Serious methodological and _ statistical
limitations of sibling research have impeded previous research on how sibling
characteristics are related to intelligence.
A study by Belmont-and Marolla (1973)
Overcame many of the methodological
shortcomings of prior research, but the
study relied on a conservative statistical
analysis which prevented the character of
the relationships between the variables
from being revealed. By using complex
multiple regression models to construct
regression surfaces, the present study
shows that family size and birth order
have differential linear and quadratic relationships with intelligence in different
social class groups.
