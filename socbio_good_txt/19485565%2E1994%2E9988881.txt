Sex Ratios at Birth in Micronesia:

Reply to James

We have observed that Micronesian
populations are now and have been in
the past characteristically highly masculinized at birth (i.e., secondary sex
ratios of over 108-110). From an evolutionary perspective, we are interested in asking how this finding may
reflect or promote microevolutionary
change in this island setting. Particularly because sex-selective infanticide
is not a plausible explanation of this
pattern 1n the region, we have concentrated on examining aspects of reproductive behavior in Micronesia for
clues to proximate/remote mechanisms
that may promote this pattern of male

versus female births. We have identi- 
fied several key, unique features of the
reproductive complex of Micronesian
island populations (Brewis, 1993; Underwood, 1990a,b). One of the most
singular defining features of the Teproductive pattern of these groups is high
coital rates, maintained against age
and marriage duration.

Our initial forays into the possibility

of an association betwéen secondary.

sex ratios (SSR) and coital behavior

was precipitated by James’ own exten- ©

sive discussions (e:g., James, 1987,
1990), although he has recently expressed doubts about the nature of the
exact mechanism, and whether the association is direct or indirect (James,

1994). Our argument is not that the sex
ratios at birth represent a priori evidence of high coital rates with age, but
rather, SSR patterns in Micronesia are
a corollary of the unique biobehavioral
reproductive features of these island
groups, which includes high coital
rates. |

Professor James’ concerns with our
papers appear to relate to two considerations: (1) the statistical aspect of results from small scale populations: and
(2) the veracity and reliability of results
from ethnographic research. It is regrettable that Professor James appears
not to be familiar with the techniques
and methodology employed by modern ethnographers in their field studies.
These methods entail extensive and intensive cross-checking, multiple verification, and repeated re-evaluation of

information collected from a large

number of independent sources. As
observer-participants, we each used a
wide range of data to reach actual find-.
ings rather than merely generate hypotheses about “... a Micronesian
pattern of marital sexuality.”

For example, in the Butaritari case,
conclusions are drawn from several

very different, but consistent, lines of

evidence that show coital rates are
maintained with age and marriage duration in this group: ethnographic data

showing the marriage relationship
maintains a highly sexualized and
charged emotional environment, demographic data showing no effective
reduction in fertility through the first
two decades of marriage, and women’s
own reports of frequent sexual activity
through their life cycles. ©

As two anthropological demographers working in the smallest-scale settings, we use tools and data types that
are more appropriate to small samples,
often different than those for which
Professor James notes a preference,
namely large-scale survey or census

samples. We gladly acknowledge the |

limits of the “minute samples,” and
consistently argue against the overuse
of statistical inference under such conditions, especially since the very defining demographic nature of small island
populations is the inherency of stochasm. a
What we lose in statistical “power”

from working with small, relatively

circumscribed populations, we believe
we more than gain back in being able
to conceptualize, contextualize, compare, and cross-check sufficiently to
make informed and balanced judgments about such demographic scenarios. So, while our counts are often
comparatively small (compared to the
21 million births recorded in England
and Wales in 1938-68, for example),
we are able to describe a population
sample that is essentially both geographically and temporally complete
(and effective). In fact, in the case of
the sex ratios arguments we have covered almost all births in these popula

tions over the last century, and we
have sample sizes in the thousands.
We consider these acceptable for use
of chi-square and sufficient to make inferences about variations in sex ratios
by age group as they relate to coital
activity.

Patterns of sexual behavior, including how often people have sex, vary
markedly among human _ groups—
something anthropologists have long
noted anecdotally and have more recently begun to document systematically and seriously. More specifically,
Euroamerican marital sexuality does
not define the universal pattern of our
species—a fact for which some might
be grateful.

If Professor James prefers data from
larger (and specifically nonanthropological) samples, we offer the results of
the Demographic and Health Surveys
(DHS), which. have used very consistent methods and large sample sizes.
Of the series of national samples dis- ©
cussed by Blanc and Rutenberg (1991),
many showed declining coital rates
with age when marriage duration was
controlled. However, one stayed stable, and several actually increased.
They conclude there is “no consistent
pattern [of coital frequency] by age
... Once marriage duration has been
controlled” (p. 171). In closing, might
we suggest that a charge of a “return to
romance” might be best applied to
those who cannot accept fieldworkbased conclusions about human sexual
behavior in island settings as anything
other than exotic and erotic.
