in Texas Counties

ABSTRACT: An ecological analysis of infant mortality rates is conducted using data on Texas counties for the years 1968-72. It is found that when counties along the Texas-Mexico border (which
have unreasonably low infant death rates and which are economically less advantaged than the
remainder of the counties) are excluded from the analysis, the associations between socioeconomic
status variables and infant mortality rates improve considerably. A significant negative correlation
between neonatal mortality and per cent Spanish surname is retained and does not disappear when
the effects of other relevant variables (per cent Negro, per cent urban, and per cent below poverty)
are controlled using partial correlation and regression analysis. Possible explanations for this unexpected finding are suggested, and implications for further research are discussed.

Despite improvements in medicine and
public health, and despite dramatic declines in infant mortality in the past century, social scientists have extensively
documented the continued existence in industrial societies of a strong inverse relationship between socioeconomic status
and infant mortality rates (Adamchak and
Stockwell, 1978; Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Brooks, 1975b; Gortmaker,
1979; Stockwell et al., 1978). In contrast
to this general pattern, researchers have
failed to clearly establish whether Mexican Americans in the Southwest United
States experience higher infant mortality
rates than the more socioeconomically advantaged Anglo population.

Some recent studies have found no relationship between the proportion of the
population that is of Spanish surname or
ancestry and infant mortality, once socioeconomic status is controlled (Markides
and Barnes, 1977; Roberts et al., 1970).
Other studies have yielded findings which
suggest that regardless of their lower
status, Mexican Americans may experience infant mortality rates (particularly in

261

the neonatal period or first 28 days of life)
that are similar to or even lower than those
of Anglos. Teller and Clyburn (1974), for
example, using data from Texas State Economic Areas (SEA’s) for 1970-72, found
the lowest infant mortality rates in the
poorest SEA’s along the Texas-Mexico
border which are most heavily populated
by Mexican Americans; and, within the
border region, the rates were lowest
among Spanish-surnamed persons whose
per capita income in 1970 was only onethird that of the Anglos (see Teller, 1978,
for a description of the socioeconomic
characteristics of the border region). Another study, based on matched birth and
death certificates in Houston for 1958-60,
which controlled for legitimacy status,
birth order, age of mother, and birth
weight (but not socioeconomic status),
found that “‘the Spanish surname neonatal
mortality level, despite the group’s much
less favorable socioeconomic conditions,
resembles the Anglo experience rather
than the Black experience” (Gee et al.,
1976, p. 324).

At least two possible explanations have

262 Markides and Hazuda

been offered to account for these unexpected findings: (1) vital statistics for Mexican Americans in Texas are unreliable,
resulting in infant death rates that are considerably lower than the true rates‘; (2)
the true infant death rates of Mexican
Americans are lower than the rates of
other disadvantaged populations and are
comparable to those of the more advantaged Anglos because of certain unique
qualities associated with Mexican American culture.

Teller and Clyburn (1974) opted for the
first explanation to account for the low infant mortality rates of Mexican Americans
in the Texas-Mexico border region. They
suggested that ‘“The relatively low Spanish surname IMR’s along the border seem
to be related both to an artificial inflation
of the denominator (live births) and an underrepresentation of the numerator
(deaths)” (p. 245), a phenomenon principally resulting from Mexican mothers
crossing the border to give birth on the
United States side, presumably to assure
dual citizenship status for their children.
Since many of these births are registered
as occurring to residents of the United
States, there is an artificial inflation of
births in these border counties. Moreover,
any deaths occurring to these infants after
they return to Mexico go unregistered in
the United States, thereby leading to a
deflation of infant deaths. The net effect is
artificially low infant mortality rates along
the United States side of the border. The
same logic suggests that infant mortality
rates on the Mexican side of the border
would be artificially inflated.

To what extent infant mortality rates
for Mexican Americans are also underestimated outside the border region is not
well established. In addressing this question, Bradshaw and Fonner (1978, p. 267)

'For a discussion of the quality of vital statistics
for persons of Spanish origin, see Juarez (1978).

Social Biology

suggested: “At ages beyond infancy in
that region and at all ages elsewhere in the
state, itseems unlikely that deaths of Mexican Americans should be reported differently from those of others.’ Palloni
(1978), however, suggested the possibility
of artificially low infant mortality rates for
Mexican Americans, even outside the
border area, particularly in rural areas.
They could originate, he maintains, in
“underregistration of deaths by MexicanAmerican mothers who voluntarily conceal the death of a child in order to avoid
official sanctions if they are not in possession of a permit making them legal residents or in order to bypass the economic
and social costs of a traditional burial’’.?
By using an indirect technique (Sullivan,
1972), Palloni estimated that ‘“‘in nonmetropolitan state economic areas and in
Texas as a whole, the Mexican American
infant mortality, on the average, seems to
be in error [underestimated] by about
17%’’(p. 289).

Gee et al. (1976) provided a different
explanation for the low neonatal mortality
of Mexican Americans in Houston, attributing it to “more favorable birth weight
distribution and full term gestation period” (p. 324). They go on to suggest that
“certain socio-cultural factors associated
with the Mexican American family system
... might encourage better care of
mothers and children” (p. 234). What
specifically these factors might be was not
noted. Teller and Clyburn (1974) also en
*Palloni goes on to suggest: “The practice of concealing infant deaths and, in general, deaths at other
ages as well is not an uncommon practice among people living in isolated places. But it ts also a fairly established practice among groups in which burial procedures are fairly elaborate and relatively expensive
for low income families. Death concealment takes
place in these instances as a measure of avoiding
shame and other social sanctions” (1978, p 285).
Though he does not explicitly state it, Palloni implies
that Mexican American funerals are elaborate and
expensive. For support of this point, see Kalish and
Reynolds (1976) and Moore (1970).

tertained a similar explanation for the low
infant mortality rates along the border—
that the “unique birth care system of the
border may well be saving some babies
who might otherwise be lost” (p. 245).

In light of contradictory and unexpected findings related to infant mortality
rates among Mexican Americans in
Texas, particularly at the neonatal period,
this study is designed to shed further light
on the issue through an ecological analysis
of county infant mortality rates. More
specifically, we examine the impact of the
border counties (which are thought to
have artificially low infant death rates) on
the correlations between ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and infant mortality. We
further attempt to clarify the relationship
between ethnicity (per cent Spanish) and
infant mortality by controlling for the effect of other variables which may cloud
the relationship.

Ecological research of county infant
mortality rates is commonplace (see, for
example, Brooks, 1975a; Stockwell and
Laidlaw, 1977). While tn much of this research the primary interest is in infant
mortality per se, many studies use infant
mortality as an indicator of the general
health status of the population. A few of
these use it as the dependent variable in
causal models of state health care systems
(see, for example, Anderson, 1973; Begun, 1977). Ecological analyses of county
infant mortality rates, therefore, have
both scholarly significance and public
health policy implications. Examining
methodological problems which could obscure the relationship between infant mortality and ethnic and socioeconomic factors, is thus indicated.3

3Ecological analyses of infant mortality, of
course, like all ecological analyses, have certain limitations, most notable, the reliance on aggregate data
to make inferences about individuals. However, in
many cases only ecological analyses are possible, and
often they are more appropriate than alternative
analyses.

 

Ethnicity and Infant Mortality 263

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data employed in this study are
drawn from vital statistics for Texas counties and the 1970 U.S. census. Vital statistics were used to compute infant mortality
rates and the census provided socioeconomic characteristics of counties for 1970.
To obtain more stable estimates of counties’ true infant death rates, births and infant deaths were aggregated for the fiveyear period 1968-72. Three measures of
infant deaths were calculated for each
county for this period: total infant mortality rate (deaths at ages 0-364 days/number
of live births < 1,000); neonatal infant
mortality rate (deaths at ages 0-27 days/
live births x 1,000); postneonatal infant
mortality rate (deaths at ages 28-364 days/
live births x 1,000). Even after a five-year
aggregation, many counties do not have
enough births and infant deaths to yield
reasonably stable infant death rates. Using the most common criterion for obtaining stable rates, counties with fewer than
twenty infant deaths were excluded from
the analysis (Kleinman et al., 1976).* By
this criterion, 145 of the 254 counties in
Texas qualified for inclusion. These contain 94.4 per cent of the state’s 1970 population and account for 95.6 per cent of the
live births and 96.1 per cent of infant
deaths occurring in the state during the
period 1968-72.

Border counties are here defined as
those counties within fifty miles of the
Mexican border. While this is somewhat
arbitrary, it was felt that this definition
would be most appropriate to the problem
at hand. That is, if Mexican women cross
the border to give birth in the United
States, most such births can be expected to

“Another criterion used to yield stable rates, is
the exclusion of counties with less than 1,000 births
(Brooks, 1975a). We repeated the analysis presented
below using this criterion, and we obtained virtually
identical results.

264 Markides and Hazuda

occur in the counties immediately along
the border. By this definition, there are 28
border counties. Of these, 13 had fewer
than 20 infant deaths during 1968-72 and
are thus excluded from the analysis. Of
the remaining 15 counties, 10 had populations that were over 70 per cent Spanish
surname or language in 1970, and all hada
higher proportion of families below the
poverty level than the remainder of the
state. Similarly, they have considerably
lower levels of income and education
(Teller, 1978). Yet their combined infant
mortality rate for 1968-72 was 19.5 per
1,000 compared with a rate of 21.3 for the
remainder of the state.

The analysis first presents correlation
coefficients and unstandardized simple regression coefficients between infant mortality, per cent Spanish surname and language, and several indicators of
socioeconomic status utilizing all Texas
counties which meet the above criterion
for computing stable infant mortality rates
for 1968-72. Linear multiple regression
analysis is employed since bivariate
graphs did not indicate that any of the relationships between the independent and
dependent variables deviated significantly
from linearity. We employ unstandardized regression coefficients in addition to
standardized regression and correlation
coefficients to examine the relationship
between infant mortality and ethnicity
and SES, including and excluding the border counties, because unstandardized
coefficients are more stable across subsamples than the standardized regression
coefficient or the correlation coefficients.
The latter two may vary as a function of
the standard deviations in the different
samples (Blalock, 1964). We retain the
correlation coefficient and the standardized regression coefficients because they
provide a readily interpretable measure of
the strength of the association between
variables.

 

Social Biology

The socioeconomic status indicators
employed are commonly used in studies of
infant mortality: median years of school
completed by persons 25 years old and
older, median family income in 1969, and
per cent of families below poverty level.
These correlation and regression coefficients are then computed with the border
counties excluded to determine the extent
to which removal of the border counties
results in correlation coefficients between
ethnicity and infant mortality more in line
with what would be expected given the
generally low socioeconomic status of
Mexican Americans.

Finally, partial correlation and regression analyses are employed to further clarify the relationship between ethnicity and
infant mortality by controlling the effects
of relevant variables thought to affect the
relationship. These partial correlation and
regression analyses are not aimed at developing a causal model of infant mortality. Our interest is to clarify the association between ethnicity and infant
mortality by controlling for the effects of
other independent variables. In other
words, we do not postulate causal relationships among the independent variables employed in the analysis.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents zero-order correlation
coefficients and unstandardized simple regression coefficients between per cent
Spanish and three separate indicators of
socioeconomic status with the three infant
mortality rates: total, neonatal, and
postneonatal. At the top of the table are
the coefficients obtained when using all
Texas counties with at least 20 infant
deaths during 1968-72 (N=145). They
show an unexpected negative association
between per cent Spanish and total infant
mortality that approaches statistical

(r=0.234). It is positive in the case of
postneonatal mortality but is not statisti
>While a number of the associations are moderate to strong, the associations between per cent
Spanish and total and neonatal mortality rates are
small. What is noteworthy, however, is that they are
in a direction that is opposite to what might be expected from the relative socioeconomic standing of
Spanish-surnamed persons in Texas. Finding that
changes in the associations between per cent Spanish
and infant mortality as well as in the associations between the socioeconomic variables and infant mortality after excluding the border counties are consistently in the expected direction would support the
notion that the border counties may systematically
distort these relationships.

cally significant (r=0.066). The associations between the three socioeconomic
status indicators and the three infant mortality rates are moderate and in the expected direction. As anticipated, they are
more pronounced in the postneonatal period (see Stockwell et al., 1978).

The bottom panel of Table 1 shows that
when the border counties are excluded
from the analysis, the correlation and regression coefficients between the three
measures of infant mortality and the three
socioeconomic status indicators rise considerably. Again, they are higher in the
case of postneonatal mortality, but even
the correlations with neonatal mortality

are substantial. All three are statistically
significant and provide strong support for
the notion that, in addition to being sensitive to physiological factors, neonatal
mortality is also considerably influenced
by socioeconomic factors (see Adamchak,
1979; Adamchak and Stockwell, 1978;
Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977).

The correlation and regression
coefficients between per cent Spanish and
the infant mortality rates also change in
the predicted direction when the border
counties are excluded from the analysis,
but the changes are less dramatic. The correlation with total infant mortality is reduced —0.145 to —0.003 or virtually zero;
similarly, the unstandardized B declines
from —0.036 to —0.001. The correlation
with postneonatal mortality rises from
0.066 to 0.210 which is statistically
significant; again, a corresponding increase in the regression coefficient is
noted. Finally, the correlation coefficient
with neonatal mortality declines from
—0.234 to —0.153, close to statistical
significance. The regression coefficient,
however, does not show a corresponding
decline. It remains virtually the same and
statistically significant.

It appears from these results that the
border region with what are thought to be
unreasonably low infant mortality rates
does suppress the correlation between infant mortality and any of several indicators of socioeconomic status. It also distorts the correlation between per cent
Spanish and infant mortality. However, a
negative relationship between per cent
Spanish and neonatal mortality is retained
even after the border counties are excluded. It remains to be seen whether this
relationship indicates an advantage of
Spanish surname infants over other infants during the neonatal period as suggested by the findings of Gee et al. (1976),
or whether the relationship is spurious.
The latter is examined next using partial
correlation and regression analyses.

Social Biology

One variable which could be responsible for the negative association between
per cent Spanish and neonatal mortality is
the proportion of the Black population.
Blacks are known to have considerably
higher infant mortality rates than whites
even after the effect of social class variables is controlled (NCHS, 1972; Brooks,
1975a). Since there is a moderately strong
inverse correlation between per cent
Spanish and per cent Negro (r= —0.435),
it is possible that the negative correlation
between per cent Spanish and neonatal
mortality results from the fact that counties with few persons of Spanish surname
or language are likely to contain larger
proportions of Blacks, and vice-versa.
Thus, if the proportion of Blacks is controlled, the negative relationship between
neonatal mortality and per cent Spanish
should disappear. By the same token, the
already positive correlation between per
cent Spanish and postneonatal mortality
should be expected to rise. The net outcome should be a positive correlation between per cent Spanish and total infant
mortality.®

Indeed, as Table 2 shows, when the effect of per cent Negro is held constant, the

While an alternative method of controlling for
the effect of Black infant mortality on the relationship between per cent Spanish and infant mortality
would be to remove Black births and deaths from the
rate calculations, we opted not to do this for two reasons, First, excluding Blacks from the calculations of
the dependent variables would necessitate excluding
them from the independent variables as well, which
would be difficult. Second and more important, we
prefer to control for per cent Black in an ecological
fashion even though this may be regarded as a crude
way of doing it, because it helps illustrate methodological problems in ecological research of this sort.
Excluding Blacks from the calculation of the infant
death rates would probably not affect our findings on
the relationship between per cent Spanish and infant
mortality very much, while controlling for per cent
Black through partial correlation and regression allows us to make an important methodological point.
Since we focus on methodological issues in ecological
research, it is important to show that part of the negative zero-order correlation between per cent Spanish and infant mortality is due to the relatively strong
inverse correlation between per cent Spanish and per
cent Black.

Vol. 27, No. 4

correlation coefficients between per cent
Spanish and the three infant mortality
rates change in the predicted direction:
the correlation with total infant mortality
becomes positive (r= 0.097) but not statistically significant; the correlation with
postneonatal mortality increases to 0.329,
and the correlation with neonatal mortality declines to —0.106 which is no longer
statistically significant. However, it approaches significance and continues to
suggest a possible advantage of Spanish
surname infants in the neonatal period.
Similar results are obtained with partial
regression analysis as indicated by the regression coefficients in the first row.’

To further clarify what continues to be
a suspect relationship between per cent
Spanish and neonatal infant mortality, we
controlled for the effect of level of urbanization in addition to controlling for per
cent Negro. Since urban areas tend to
have lower infant mortality rates due to
better access to health care (see Brooks,
1975a), and since there is a positive correlation between per cent urban and per
cent Spanish in our counties (r=0.198),
controlling for the level of urbanization
should lead to an additional reduction in
the negative correlation between per cent
Spanish and neonatal mortality and
should lead to increases in the positive
correlations between per cent Spanish and
postneonatal and total infant mortality.
Table 2 shows this to be the case; however, the changes are small.

The partial correlation and regression
analyses suggest that what appears to be
an advantage of Spanish surname infants

7Multicollinearity is not a serious problem. The
only relatively high intercorrelation which could
pose a problem is between per cent urban and per
cent in poverty (r= —0.57). However, a high simple
correlation coefficient is not a sufficient cause of
multicollinearity. When the variables were entered
in a regression analysis, the inclusion of per cent in
poverty had very little impact on the standard error
of per cent urban (see, for example, Rao and Miller,
1971).

over other infants, especially during the
neonatal period, is largely the result of intercorrelations of per cent Spanish with
per cent Negro and per cent urban. When
the effects of these two variables are controlled, the analyses point to only a small
possible advantage of Spanish surname infants in the neonatal period, a notable disadvantage of them in the postneonatal period, and a possible disadvantage in
overall infant mortality. However, if one

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

268 Markides and Hazuda

is interested in the effect of ethnic status
on infant mortality net of the effect of the
social class, poverty, and level of education, the partial correlations between per
cent Spanish and the infant mortality rates
should control for socioeconomic status in
addition to per cent Negro and level of urbanization. The third row of Table 2
shows partial correlation and regression
coefficients when the per cent of families
living below poverty is controlled along
with the other two variables*. Controlling
for per cent in poverty leads to an increase
in the correlation between per cent Spanish and neonatal mortality to a significant
—0.214, while the correlation with
postneonatal mortality declines to 0.162,
which is still statistically significant. The
correlation with total infant mortality becomes negative but not significant. Similar
results were again obtained when employing multiple regression analysis.

These findings seem to suggest that
when the proportion of families living below poverty (or other socioeconomic
status indicators) is statistically controlled, Spanish surname infants seem to
be disadvantaged in the postneonatal period and advantaged in the neonatal period.
Thus, using an entirely different method,
we have reached conclusions similar to
those of Gee et al. (1976) with the exception that the ethnic differences reported
here hold only when socioeconomic status
is held constant.

®Only one of the three socioeconomic status indicators is used here, since the three are highly intercorrelated. While the addition of any one of the three
yields virtually identical results, per cent below poverty was chosen over the others on theoretical
grounds. Since the relationship between SES and infant mortality is not likely to be linear, meaning that
infant deaths are more likely to be concentrated at
the very bottom of the SES scale, per cent of families
living below poverty appears to be a more appropriate variable than median family income or median
years of school completed. For a discussion of this issue, see Mechanic (1968, p. 246) and Gortmaker
(1979, p. 284).

Social Biology

DISCUSSION

Our findings show that, even after excluding the border counties with their presumed unreasonably low infant death
rates, and after controlling for the effects
of other important variables, a negative
and statistically significant correlation between per cent Spanish and neonatal mortality in Texas counties was retained.
Thus, our findings using ecological analysis are consistent with the individual level
analysis of Gee et al. (1976) who found
that relative to Anglos, Spanish surname
infants were advantaged during the neonatal period, but disadvantaged during
the postneonatal period. These authors
suggested that the Spanish surname infants’ neonatal advantage is attributable
to their more favorable birth weight distribution which, in turn, was thought to be
related to possible cultural factors leading
to better care of both mothers and infants.
This, however, does not explain the seemingly differential impact of these factors
on the neonatal and postneonatal periods.
Further, there ts little evidence to suggest
any cultural factors which may lead to better care of Mexican American infants and
mothers. To the contrary, much of the
available evidence suggests factors which
could be expected to result in higher neonatal rates among Mexican American infants. These include: high and early fertility, continued fertility into advanced ages,
greater proportion of lower-order births
(i.e., other than first-born), greater illegitimacy, less frequent use of prenatal care,
and a greater proportion of nonhospital
deliveries (Holck, 1979).

The suggestion by Gee et al. (1976) that
low neonatal mortality among Mexican
Americans is related to a more favorable
birth weight distribution is supported by
recent national data which show that
women born in Mexico (as well as other
foreign born women) have a lower perDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

centage of low birth weight babies than
native-born white women particularly
among mothers with less than 12 years of
school (NCHS, 1980, p. 7). While we may
be hard pressed to find cultural factors explaining this advantage, a migration selection explanation may be drawn upon.
Thus, if migration tends to select mothers
with high reproductive efficiency (as indicated by favorable birth weight distributions), the fact that many Mexican American mothers in Texas (and elsewhere) are
foreign born may lead to an overall advantage in neonatal mortality on the part of
Mexican Americans. The notion that migrants are reproductively more efficient is
supported by Baird’s observation that
“‘Women who migrate from depressed to
more affluent areas in the UK [United
Kingdom] tend to be taller, healthier and
more able, and to have lower perinatal
mortality rates than those in the same social classes who do not migrate ...”
(1977, p. 6).

This migration selection explanation is
consistent with differences in the ethnicity-infant mortality relationship for the
neonatal and postneonatal periods. That
is, since neonatal deaths are more closely
related to physiological factors (Stockwell, 1962), the reproductive efficiency of
Mexican immigrant women can be expected to contribute to low neonatal mortality among Mexican Americans. Postneonatal mortality, however, is largely
removed from physiological factors and is
more influenced by environmental factors. Here our findings suggest a disadvantage of Mexican Americans relative to
Anglos.

Since many Mexican American women
residing in the border region are foreign
born, it is possible that the low infant
death rates among Mexican Americans in
this area are not artifactual, but result
from a migration selection effect. That is,

Ethnicity and Infant Mortality 269

it could be argued that the unexpectedly
low infant death rates in this area are not
unreasonable since it contains many reproductively efficient and poor women.
However, this is only a partial explanation
of the phenomenon, since the evidence
that Mexican mothers cross into the
United States to give birth and subsequently return to Mexico thereby inflating
the number of births and deflating the
number of infant deaths on the U.S. side
of the border, is strong (Teller and Clyburn, 1974).

The viability of these two alternative
explanations is worth investigating. Regardless of which explanation is more viable, however, the border region is different from the remainder of the state since it
has lower infant death rates than would be
expected from its low socioeconomic
status. In addition, the negative association between per cent Spanish and neonatal mortality may be due to a migration selection effect, though more direct
evidence is needed before greater faith
can be placed in that hypothesis.

A note of caution is required since conclusions about individual level relationships based on aggregate data may not be
warranted. Our finding of a negative association between per cent Spanish and neonatal mortality, however, is supported by
individual level data (Gee et al., 1976).
Moreover, ecological analyses of this sort
are important in their own right, particularly for their public health implications.
For example, investigating the relationship between ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and infant mortality in the remainder of the United States-Mexico border
seems warranted, since ecological measures of infant mortality in those states (as
elsewhere) are relied on as indicators of
the populations general health status. Attention to the issues discussed in this paper
will improve research in this area.
