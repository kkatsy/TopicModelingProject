Son and Daughter Preferences in Benighat,
Nepal: Implications for Fertility Transition

ABSTRACT: Married women in Benighat, Nepal stressed old age security and continuity of lineage
as prominent reasons for wanting sons. In addition, women clearly desired daughters too—an
important finding that is less often stressed. Religious reasons and help with household chores
were the most common reasons reported for wanting a daughter. Strong desires for sons could
increase fertility in settings where fertility is controlled. Additional desires for daughters could
have an additional pronatalist influence. For Benighat we document a pervasive desire for at
least two sons and at least one daughter. If realized, these sex composition preferences would
increase fertility by 50 per cent. Actual effects are no doubt smaller, but the effects of sex
preference on the desire for more children and on contraceptive use are clearly visible.

I do not have any son. I could not
bear a son. God has punished me and
will continue to punish me even after
my death because there is no son to
look after me in this state of mine and
also no son for the salvation of my
soul after the death. So, I am a living
dead.

The words above were spoken by
an elderly Benighat woman who lived
alone and still performed all of the
household chores. Her comments illustrate two of the reasons commonly
given for wanting sons: to support parents in their old age and to perform religious rites for deceased parents. But
in Benighat, parents value daughters
too. In this village we document a
widespread desire for at least two sons
and at least one daughter. If couples
could realize this desire, then family
size would be relatively small (three
children per woman). But sex composition cannot be readily controlled!

1The only reliable technology available is selective abortion of female fetuses after ultrasound or
amniocentesis diagnoses. While there are reports of
frequent use of ultrasound diagnosis in the urban

and, as a result, some couples will have
more than three births before achieving their desired sex composition. A
decision rule of “‘stopping” childbearing only after two sons and one daughter have been born, produces an average family size of 4.38 (see Sheps,
1963; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983).
Thus, sex composition desires could
inflate fertility, in this example by
(4.38 — 3.0 =) 1.38 births per woman.?

This paper documents sex composition desires and their pervasiveness in
a Nepali hill area. Our evidence comes
from micro-demographic research that
combines survey research, direct observation, in-depth interviews, and

areas of India and elsewhere in Asia (see Park and
Cho, 1995, pp. 79-80), this technology was not
known by, or available to, the people of Benighat in
1988. If this technology were to become available
and to be used, then effects of sex preference on
fertility would be reduced but unbalanced sex ratios
might result (see Park and Cho, 1995),

2We have assumed that the “stopping rule” is to
continue bearing children until 2 boys and 1 girl
have been born. The impact of such rules provide
an upper bound for the effect of sex preference
(McClelland, 1979, p. 381).

case studies. The study area is in the
midst of a fertility transition. Using the
survey data to be described later,
Niraula (1990) estimated that the total
fertility rate declined from 6.4 in
1976/78 to 5.3 in 1983/86. Contraceptive prevalence among married women
who want no more children was 23 per
cent in 1989; couples with higher socioeconomic status were the main users. The primary contraceptive method
was male sterilization. Data more recently collected in Benighat suggest
further declines in fertility and increases in contraceptive use (see Morgan and Niraula, 1995).

The onset of the fertility transition is
not limited to our study population.
Recent studies indicate that after
prolonged high fertility, fertility has
started to decline in Nepal (Tuladhar,
1989; Niraula, 1990; His Majesty’s
Government [HMG], 1993). The total
fertility rate was estimated at 6.1 in
1975 and at 5.1 in 1990 (His Majesty’s
Government [HMG], 1977, 1993).
Other indicators provide further support for claims that fertility has declined recently. For example, knowledge of family planning methods has
increased considerably: as of 1990, 9
out of 10 women of reproductive age,
knew at least one method of contraception. Contraceptive prevalence rates
among currently married, nonpregnant
women have increased from 3 per cent
in 1976, to 15 per cent in 1986, and to
24 per cent in 1991 (HMG, 1987,
1991). Similarly, literacy rates among
women have increased from 11 per
cent in 1971 to 25 per cent in 1991
(Central Bureau of Statistics, 1992).
The Nepali government has also been
attempting to provide basic health care
facilities to its population. These ef
Son and Daughter Preferences

forts have increased survival prospects
for children, reducing somewhat the
demand for large families. Legal provisions, such as minimum age at marriage, have also been introduced. All
these factors may have contributed to
recent fertility declines in Nepal.

Sex preference in transitional settings may impede the fertility transition. One can also think of sex preference as a measure/consequence of
gender inequality. Findings in this paper lead us to conclude that gender differentiation of tasks and roles is so
great that the roles of sons and daughters cannot be interchanged. Couples
in Benighat conceptualize family size
desires not as a single number but as a
minimum number of surviving adult
sons and daughters. This frame of reference has relevance for population
policies and programs in Nepal, a
country which may be in the midst of
the transition from high to low fertility.

BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SEX
PREFERENCES

Social scientists have shown sustained interest in sex preference (see
Sheps, 1963; Coombs et al., 1975;
Williamson, 1976; Cleland et al., 1983;
Arnold, 1985, 1991; Bongaarts and
Potter, 1985; Lightbourne, 1985; McClelland, 1979, 1983a, 19835; Levine,
1987; Rahman and DaVanzo, 1993). A
preference for sons is widespread, especially in South Asia, East Asia, and
in some areas of the Middle East and
North Africa (Williamson, 1976; Arnold, 1991). More specifically, there is
strong evidence of son preference in
Nepal and within the hill region of

258

Nepal on which we focus (Karki,
1988). But it is rare even in these areas
for women to say that they want no
daughters.

While there is a strong consensus on
the existence of sex preference, there is
less agreement on whether sex preference substantially increases fertility.
Briefly, Arnold (1991), in an analysis
of the 1991 DHS data, finds weak evidence of sex preference effects on fertility across countries, but McClelland
(1979, 1983) points out that the most
commonly used strategies for assessing
effects are flawed, usually seriously underestimating the effects of sex preference. Formally, the pronatalist impact
of a particular sex preference depends
on the degree of fertility control and on
the degree of control over the sex of
children which are born (McClelland,
1983a). If the former is high and the
latter low, then sex preference could
exert a powerful influence. Sex preference will exert a powerful influence if
the desire for certain sex compositions
overwhelms concerns about the number of children. Thus, the impact of
sex preference is specific to particular
contexts—those with substantial fertility control, those without effective control of sex of children, and those where
sex composition is relatively important
vis-a-vis number of children. We will
argue that the transitional setting we
study, Benighat, has these features.

Explanations for the existence and
persistence of sex preference are also
specific to particular contexts. Williamson (1976) outlines possible parental
motivations for son preference under
the broad headings: economic, social,
and psychological. The relative importance of these broad categories or of
particular elements within them could

Niraula and Morgan

Social Biology

vary from setting to setting. Few studies provide thorough explanations for
the existence and persistence of sex
preference. Instead, most social demographic work has been aimed at measuring sex preference or estimating its
impact on fertility as opposed to identifying reasons for its existence. In this
paper we focus on both the socialeconomic-cultural basis and the fertility impact of sex preference.

BENIGHAT

Ecologically, Nepal is divided into
three parallel regions: the mountains,
the hills, and the terai (plains) each
running from east to west. The hills,
with roughly 46 per cent of the total
population in 1991 (CBS, 1992) have
been considered the heart of Nepali
culture and society. Our data are taken
from the Benighat Survey, 1988
(Niraula, 1991). The study area lies 75
km southwest of Kathmandu in the
central hills.

The village (or gaon) is the most
common term for referring to a settlement or cluster of settlements. These
villages can vary in size from 2-3
households to hundreds of households.
Our data were collected in eight main
settlement clusters where we interviewed all women aged 15-54. Within
these main settlement clusters, there
are many more subsettlement areas (or
compounds) often delineated by caste
and ethnicity or by stream and topography.

Our study can be usefully compared
to one by Karki (1988). His study was
conducted in the hill region about ten
years earlier than our study. His respondents lived in Gorkha, a rural district, and Pokhara, a town of 36,000 at
the time of the 1979 survey. Our study
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

site lies roughly halfway between
Pokhara and Kathmandu. A focus of
the Karki study was sex preference,
and many of our empirical findings are
consistent with those he reports. But,
as we note in the discussion, our assessments of the import of sex preference
are different.

Culturally, the study area is a microcosm of the central hill Nepali society.
All major caste-ethnic groups are
represented in the study population.
Caste-ethnicity is an ascribed characteristic and is the basis for traditional
social stratification in Nepal. It is
somewhat related to the Indian caste
system based on the Varna. Casteethnic groups represented include
Bahun, Chhetri, Kami, Damai,
Newar, Gurung, Chepang, Muslims,
and others. Bahun is the highest caste,
followed by Chhetri. Kami and Damai,
who were untouchables (and still are in
practice even though prohibited by
law), belong to the lowest strata of the
society. The indigenous and tribal populations, which are scattered in different pockets of the Kingdom, still maintain their uniqueness despite concerted
efforts to bring them into the caste-fold
through unification of Nepal and use of
Mulki-Ain (civil code). Gurung, Magar, Rai, and Limbu, predominantly
Tibeto-Burman groups, belong to this
category and are taken as middle castes
for the purpose of this study.3 Almost
half of our respondents were highercaste Hindus (Bahun and Chhetri). Of
the remaining half, 17 per cent were

3This group is usually known as a hill tribal population. While we are not sure of their status in the
caste hierarchy, they are usually above the untouchables and below the higher caste Brahman and
Chhetris. For details, see Bista 1972; Gaige 1975;
Gurung 1989; Hofer 1979; Bishop 1990.

Son and Daughter Preferences

259

from the Tibeto-Burman group, about
15 per cent were service caste untouchables, and the remainder form a heterogenous residual group. The form
and intensity of sex preference could
vary by caste (see Williamson, 1976,
Chap. 1).

The structure of Nepali society, and
Benighat in particular, is patrilineal
and patriarchal. These structures encourage son preference and reinforce
its existence. To a large extent, a
woman’s status is tied to her ability
to produce children, especially a son.
Through her children, a wife gains limited control over her husband and
greater autonomy in other spheres of
life. A childless woman is pitied.

Niraula (1991) argues that differential socialization for boys and girls
starts at a very early age and is maintained throughout the life cycle,
thereby maintaining gender segregation and differentiation. Sons are considered as bread-earners while daughters are raised and trained to be good
housewives. Educational opportunities
reflect the differential opportunities
available to males and females in Benighat. The project area is served
by a number of primary schools and
two high-schools. About 66 per cent
of boys and 55 per cent of girls of
school age (6-15 years) were attending
school. However, as the level of
schooling goes up, the percentage of
girls in school falls sharply, producing
a sex disparity in educational attainment.

The rural agricultural economy
makes children an economic asset. As
stated earlier, a large majority of
people in Benighat depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Seasonality
of the agricultural operations make

transplanting and harvesting times
crucial ones when labor is in great demand. Rural people value secure
sources of labor. Family labor provides
this secure labor source. Moreover, agricultural operations are based on a
sharp division of labor. Some tasks
are performed specifically by men; others, by women. Therefore, families try
to maintain this gender-differentiated
pool of labor by producing children.4
Young daughters fulfill the female labor needs of their family of origin. But
when daughters marry, they become
part of their husband’s family’s work
group and are replaced by sisters-inlaw.

Sons of any age can claim inheritance rights to their parents’ property.
But a daughter cannot claim it until age
35, and only then if she remains unmarried. Inheritance of parental property
binds sons to the family in both directions. Parents hope that their sons will
care for them in their old age, while
sons try to maximize the benefits from
inheritance (Niraula, 1991, 1995).

In terms of development, Benighat
provides a changing social context.
Since the mid-1970’s, Benighat has
been linked to Kathmandu and India
by a paved highway. While still primarily agricultural, Benighat has been
shifting toward producing agricultural
products that can be sent to Kathmandu. There is a rafting company located just outside of Benighat that
takes tourists for rafting trips down the
Trishuli River. Benighat had no electricity when this study was carried out.
Now a few houses share a generator

that produces electricity for lights from
dusk until about 10:00 p.m. Within the
past few months a video cassette recorder (VCR) has been purchased, and
villagers pay to see Indian movies in
groups of 6-12. Thus, Benighat is an
area in transition. There are many
more isolated locales in Nepal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Benighat Survey was conducted
over a period of five months in late
1988 using micro-demographic research methodology which includes
components of both survey research
and anthropological research (Caldwell and Hill, 1988; Axinn et al., 1991).
Census-type enumeration of households was followed by selection of
primary respondents, all ever-married
women aged 15-54 in the selected
settlement areas. Data on marriage,
fertility, family planning, and value of
children were collected using a structured questionnaire. A total of 625
households was covered which yielded
719 women aged 15-54 years. The total population at the time.of the survey
was 3,809 (see Niraula (1991) for more
details).

RESULTS
REASONS FOR HAVING SONS

Cain (1981, 1982, 1984, 1991), and
Dixon-Mueller (1989) have argued
that in many developing countries, the
patriarch (son or husband) is responsible for saving the family from famine,
drought, and other vicissitudes. Our
case studies, observations, and survey
data indicate that children, mainly
sons, remain a principal means of
averting risks in Benighat.

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

The survey questionnaire contained
several questions on values and disvalues of having children. One of the
open-ended questions asked: Why do
you want to have at least one son? We
followed the procedures developed for
the Value of Children Study (VOC) described by Fawcett et al. (1974) to code
this open-ended question.5 Answers
were grouped into the following five
categories:

1. Old age SUPPOTTt ............ceeeee ees 38.9
Ze LAM CAGE as ps xaos ose sa esnacen ne nsn ag engs 35.5
3. Religious reasons...........eeeeeeees 9.5
4. To provide labor..............cecceeee 8.5
5. Companionship/emotional ......... 7.8

Total......ccccccsscccsescccecssceves 100.0

Values attached to children are a
manifestation of current economic realities and historical/cultural heritage.
Nearly two-fifths of the respondent reported that old age support was the
prime motive for desiring a son. As in
the rural areas of many other developing countries, there are virtually no old
age insurance systems instituted by the
government or private industries for
the general public. Agriculture is the
main source of subsistence and sustenance. Saving cash to meet future exigencies is a rarity in this setting. Given
these facts, intergenerational transfers
by rural householders provide a solution to old age dependency.

The second most important reason
given for wanting a son was continuity
of lineage, mentioned by 35 per cent of
the respondents. As noted earlier, Be
SOnly one response (first) is included in the table. Open-ended questions were coded following
sets of values and dis-values developed by Fawcett
et al. (1974, p. 4-6) for the Value of Children Study
(VOC). However, only a few categories could be
used because of the lack of a wide range of answers
in different categories and the small number of cases
for each category.

Son and Daughter Preferences

261

nighat is predominantly a Hindu area.
Continuity of clan or lineage is considered an important role of progeny in
the Hindu religion. The Hindu code of
conduct considers continuity as one of
the duties of a family member. The
continuity of the family name can only
be achieved through a male offspring
who will keep the title of his father that
has been passed from generation to
generation.

Closely tied to the lineage or the
continuity value of sons is his religious
value. People in the Benighat area believe that it is the earnest duty of a son
to mourn the death of his parents and
to help them achieve moksha (salvation of soul) after their death. A son(s)
can do this through observance of
appropriate mourning and worship
procedures. A couple without a son is
called aputro (without a son), and
there are many rituals designed to help
a couple avoid being aputro.

Other reasons for wanting a son included: help with farm operations or
the family business (9 per cent) and
companionship (8 per cent). To be assured of a good harvest in seasonal agriculture, the family needs a pool of
family labor available for cultivating or
harvesting the crop. Family labor is important because there may be no available labor for hire or exchange at the.
time of peak agricultural operation because all families are busy in their own
cultivation. Moreover, certain agricultural tasks such as ploughing, supervising, and arranging labor are gender
specific. Only men can perform them.

Lastly, about 8 per cent of respondents in the survey said that they
wanted a son for companionship. In
Benighat, women gain status through
children, and especially sons. Mothers

262

will be called after their child’s name
such as Rame Ki Aama (Ram’s
mother). Children, especially sons, are
also a source of power for the younger
mother in communication and bargaining with family elders. It is therefore
not surprising that some respondents
wanted a son mainly for companionship and emotional reasons.

Successful and powerful families in
Benighat have many sons, and villagers
point to them as evidence of the value
of sons.

Mr. Y had four sons and two daughters.
About ten years ago, he was almost
bankrupt and was barely able to meet
the subsistence needs of the family. Because of the family’s deteriorating conditions, the eldest son left the household
to look for a job. He got a job in India.
This was an important transition, and he
began to support his family by sending
money now and then.

In the village, the agriculture extension service was providing incentives for
innovators of new crops, mostly vegetable crops. The eldest son encouraged
the family members, especially the next
oldest brother, to plant new crops. The
initial capital was provided both by the
eldest son and the agricultural extension
service.

The crop was a success. This was a
critical juncture in the success of the
family. They continued to take advantage of the new crops which provided
cash for the schooling of the two
younger sons and the grandchildren.
This wealth also enabled Mr. Y to organize the marriage of his daughters.

When the survey team was in the village, both of the younger sons were employed, one as a teacher and the other.
one in a road construction company.
The second son was looking after the
farm assisted by his two younger brothers and all other family members. Nowadays, Mr. Y is considered one of the

Niraula and Morgan

Social Biology

luckiest persons in Benighat with all the
luxuries of life. He is very proud of his
sons. (From field notes.)

Most of the villagers point to Mr.
Y’s household as evidence of the advantage of having sons. A large number of successful sons in the village can
increase political power. In a study ofa
Tamang community, Fricke (1990, p.
139) noted that ‘‘village-wide political
leadership may be thought of as an
extension of the more domestic orders
of prestige and status.” The political
benefits of having a large number of
successful sons is illustrated in the following case study in Benighat:

One of the most influential families in
Benighat consisted of four sons. The
first was the area member of the now
dissolved district Panchayat. The second
was the president of the farmers organization at the zonal level. The third was
looking after the interest of an estate in
the terai and the fourth was the president of the local youth organization.
Together, they exercised a strong political, economic, and social force over all
other groups. Because of their influence
among the people in the village and in
the neighborhood, not only were they
able to oust powerful rival contenders
allied to a powerful lobby group at the
national level, but also to strengthen
and improve their own position in the
village. (From field notes.)

REASONS FOR HAVING DAUGHTERS

Interviewers also asked respondents
why they desired daughters. We were
surprised by the strength of the desire
for at least one daughter. Answers
given can be grouped into categories
below:

1. Religious reasoms ...........seeeee0- 41.6

5. Old-age security .............seeeeeee D4
Ota ss sa cx css su ss sea es oe pense yess oe 100.0

Most respondents gave religious
motives for wanting a daughter (41.6
per cent). Hindus attach great importance to marrying their daughter at
a relatively young age, especially the
higher castes. Marriage of the prepubertal (kanya) virgin daughter is associated with the attainment of punya
(merit). That is why daughters are
given away as daan (gift), and it is disgraceful to obtain financial or other
support from the person who receives
the gift. She is paraya dhan (others’
property). By marrying-off their
daughter at a young age (kanya-daan
or gift of a virgin), parents have not
only fulfilled an important act of their
life-cycle, but have also assured themselves a place in heaven by performing
an important duty. Daughters are also
considered as a source of wealth
(laxmi) and are though to bring good
fortune to the family. There is a special
festival (Bhai Tika) devoted to the
well-being of brothers and sisters.°®

A girl’s physical development is
carefully watched, and her reputation
guarded. One reason school attendance for girls declines at higher levels
of education is that parents fear emotional and sexual attachments may
develop, and they want to avoid any
embarrassment that might result from
them. These fears lead parents to
search for a groom and to marry their
daughters at a young age.

6Sisters worship their brothers to ward off devils
and back luck as a reciprocity for the protection and
help brothers provide to them. Brothers reward
their sisters paying due respect. However, modalities of the worship may vary for ethnic groups and
caste groups.

Son and Daughter Preferences

 

263

Help around the household which
includes farm operations and livestock
raising is the second most common
reason given for wanting a daughter
(22.5 per cent). In an agricultural society, demand for labor is high at
certain periods of time. In Nepal,
women (compared to men) are reported to contribute more labor in agriculture, in caring for livestock, and
in housework (Acharya and Bennett,
1981; APROSC, 1992; WDPC, 1992).
Young children, and especially daughters, contribute significantly to the labor pool of the family. Young daughters are frequently seen fetching water,
fuel, and fodder, or taking care of
younger siblings and helping mothers
in their errands. Women find relief in
a helping hand from a daughter. Not
surprisingly, women expressed the
importance of help from a daughter
as one of the reasons for desiring a
daughter.

More than 13 per cent of mothers
mentioned companionship and emotional support as the prime reasons
for having daughters. Others stressed
lineage continuity (15.2 per cent) and
old age security (7.4 per cent). Since
daughters are given to the grooms as
a gift, people do not expect old age
support from their daughters. Support
from daughters is generally looked
down upon by others in the community. It is viewed as “borrowing” from
the family to which one has given the
daughter. However, if a couple does
not have a son, then they must turn
to their daughter (and son-in-law) to
provide old age support. Existence of
tribal-ethnic groups in the population
has contributed to the lineage expectations reported in the surveyed population.

264

Because the values associated with
either sons or daughters are not interchangeable, and because of the high
value placed on both sons and daughters, pronatalist attitudes permeate the
village community. The old age security motive and demand for child labor
do not account fully for the pronatalism. Lineage and religious reasons are
also important. Therefore, we concur
with other researchers that the preponderance of economic theorization has
neglected the cultural and normative
values attached to children (Cleland
and Wilson, 1987; Levine, 1987; Vlassoff, 1990).

DOCUMENTING THE IMPORTANCE OF
SEX AND COMPOSITIONAL PREFERENCES

Analyses of responses to several
questions allow us to demonstrate the
existence of son preference and the
desire to have at least one daughter.
Table 1 shows the cross-classification
of answers to two hypothetical questions: If you could begin your life over
again, how many daughters would you
have? ... How many sons? The first
thing to notice is that the row and column marginals are dissimilar. Women
are more than eight times more likely
to report “3, 4, or 5+” sons than to
report this number of daughters. At
the aggregate level then, there is son
preference. But without looking within
the table, one cannot tell to what extent individual women desire more
sons than daughters. At one extreme,
there could be two classes of women:
those who want only sons and those
who want only daughters. The observed marginals could reflect more
of the former than the latter. Alternatively, every woman could desire the

number of daughters less than or equal
to (< =) the number of sons.

Observed frequencies indicate the
latter scenario. They show that respondents tend to cluster on or below the
main diagonal. Only 10 women report
that “if they could start over again”
they would have more daughters than
sons. In contrast, 377 wives report that
they would have more sons than
daughters; 296 wives report they would
have equal numbers of sons and daughters. Thus, both at the aggregate level
(the marginals) and for individuals
(respondents), there is evidence of
widespread son preference.

Characterizations of the data are
represented by the selected models in
Table 2 and by the “‘pattern matrix” of
the preferred model in Table 3. This
pattern matrix captures the important
features of the data in Table 1 (e.g., it
produces expected frequencies that
match the observed data very closely)
and represents the preferred model
for these data. Specifically, “‘F’’ reflects
the extent to which row and column
marginals are dissimilar. Women are
more likely (by a factor of 8.5 = F) to
give answers of “2, 3, and 4+” to the
son question compared to the daughter
question.

the evidence of son preference is unmistakable and is captured by the F
and f parameters. Nevertheless, note
that few would have no girls. Most
women report a desire for one or two
girls and for two or more boys.

A second set of questions allows
us to address related issues. Married
women were asked:

You have ____ sons and ___ daughters.
Are you satisfied with this number? Yes
No

Do you intend to have another child?
Yes No

Are you currently using any method of
contraception? Yes No

Which number and sex compositions
produced the highest level of satisfaction, the greatest intent for no more
children, and the highest level of contraceptive use? A cursory examination
of data in Table 4 shows that the odds
of being satisfied (Panel 1), wanting no
more children (Panel 2), and using
contraception (Panel 3) rise with number of living children. Some women are
still in the midst of the childbearing
years and will have additional children.
But few express satisfaction (intend no
more children, or use contraception)
until they have at least two, and especially three or four children.

If we examine satisfaction for those
with a given number of children, then
substantial sex preference is obvious.
For those with two children, few with
only two daughters are satisfied. If
there are sons, then the odds of being
satisfied are much higher. But most
women want more than two children,
which explains why satisfaction is
much higher at subsequent parities.
Also note that dissatisfaction can be
expressed by the deficit of women
with given sex/number compositions.

Women with “unsatisfactory” compositions would try to have an additional
birth. For instance, women with only
two children are 2.8 ({17 + 14]/
[2 + 9]) times more likely to have two
sons and no daughters compared to
two daughters and no sons. There
should be roughly the same number of
two-son and two-daughter families if
there were no sex preference.”

7One would expect slightly more boys to be born
because the sex ratio at birth (males/100 females) is
generally found to be in the 102-106 range.

We fit a set of logistic regression
models to these data. Coefficients are
shown in Table 5. Model 1 includes
only an effect of number of children.
Model 2 includes three sex composition contrasts. At parity two, there is a
contrast for those who have two sons
versus two daughters, and a second
contrast for those who have one son
and one daughter versus two daughters. Relative to two daughters, note
that the odds on being satisfied are 5.5
and 8.8 times greater if there are two
sons and one son and one daughter

respectively. The third contrast is for
those with three or more children. This
contrast is between those who have at
least two sons and those who do not.
Specifically, for those with three or
more children, having at least two sons
raises the odds of being satisfied by a
factor of 5.5.8

We repeated this analysis substituting “Do you intend another child?”
for the ‘“‘Are you satisfied question?”
analyzed above. As can be seen from
Panel 2 of Table 5, the model chosen

8The first and third sex composition contrast
could be constrained to be equal in all three models.
Such a constraint does not affect substantive inter
‘pretation, but produces a slightly more parsimoni
ous model (as measured by degrees of freedom). We
have not constrained these effects to be equal because our models selection strategy searched for
preferred sex compositions at each parity. Thus,
we prefer this parameterization because it is more
consistent with our substantive understanding and
model selection process.

 

 

to describe these data is identical to,
and the substantive interpretation is
the same as, the above.

Finally, the behavioral measure,
currently using contraception, varies as
these items do across number and sex
composition of children. But the magnitude of sex composition effects on
contraceptive use is much smaller than
on responses discussed above. At parity three and above, those with two
sons are 70 per cent more likely to be
using contraception than those who
have fewer than two sons. The failure
to translate satisfaction and desire for
no more children into contraceptive
use is consistent with claims of substantial unmet need for contraception
in this population (see Karki, 1988;
Shrestha et al., 1988; Niraula, 1991).

We have formally compared our results with those of Karki (1988). We

find no evidence that the effects of sex
composition vary between study populations (Table 6). In sum, the results
above appear very robust and provide
strong evidence of sex preference effects on satisfaction, intentions, and
contraceptive behavior.

Substantively, these effects perfectly fit expectations gathered in less
formal ways (visual inspection of the
data, observation in the village, and
conversations with residents). The desire for sons results from the important
roles sons must fill. Having only one
son is a risky strategy because this one
son may not be able to fulfill all the
family obligations or may die.

PERVASIVENESS OF SEX AND
COMPOSITIONAL PREFERENCES

Without a question, caste and size of
landholding provide the basis for key

differentiating statuses in Benighat.
Caste and landholding are also strongly
and positively associated with one another. The key question we ask here:
Are sex and compositional preferences
pervasive in Benighat or are they
stronger in some segments of the community?

The “‘land-security” hypothesis posits that ownership of land exerts a negative long-term effect on fertility because of income returns to equity and
subsequent increase in old age security
(Schutjer and Stokes, 1982; Stokes and
Schutjer, 1984). It can be speculated
that son preference would be greater
among the landless than among those
with more land. The reason is that land
can provide old age support, thus reducing dependence on sons. Alternatively, lineage issues may be judged
more important by high caste or landed

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

families. We find some evidence of the
latter when we examine reasons for
wanting a son by caste and by landholding (results not shown here). That
is, women in landless families mention
old age security more prominently than
do those with more land; women with
more land report continuity of lineage
more frequently. Niraula (1995) has
found that parental expectations of old
age security is strengthened if they
have both large landholdings and sons.

In short, the reasons for wanting
sons are numerous. Some reasons are
more salient for certain groups than for
others, but these differences appear to
offset one another. The desire for a
daughter is also based on a broad number of factors and thus appears quite
pervasive.

In order to test this hypothesis more
formally, we replicated the analysis in
Table 5 with a control for caste. We
were unable to reject the hypothesis
that sex composition effects estimated
in Table 5 were the same across five
caste groups. Likewise, we uncovered
no evidence of differential effects
across four landholding groups.° Thus,
we conclude that the sex composition
preferences documented earlier are
pervasive across caste and socioeconomic groups.

SEX PREFERENCE EFFECTS
ON FERTILITY

In the introduction we noted little
consensus On the impact of sex preference on fertility. Just how pronatalist is
sex preference? We have stressed that
the answer to this question varies by

°The four categories of ownership of landholding were: landless, small (up to 0.5 hectare), medium (0.51 to 1.5 hectare) and 1.51 hectare and
above.

 

Son and Daughter Preferences 269

features of the social context. In Benighat, the potential effect is large, and
the actual effect is substantial. The potential effect can be estimated by comparing desired number of boys plus
girls with the mean family size required
to achieve that sex composition. If we
take the data in Table 1 and assume
that women would stop childbearing
when the number of children equaled
to sum of boys plus number of girls desired, then the mean number born
would be 3.3. If on the other hand we
assumed that women would continue
to bear children until they satisfied
their desired sex composition, then
they would bear approximately 4.8
children, nearly a 50 per cent increase.!° Clearly, strong sex composition desires (in the absence of sex selection technology) could increase
fertility substantially. The desire for a
minimum number of sons can have a
pronatalist impact. And if a minimum
number of daughters is required too,
then an additional pronatalist force is
possible. We are not suggesting that
the actual effect of sex preference will
be a 50 per cent increase in fertility.
Rather, we see this figure as the maximum possible effect.

Past effects of sex preference can be
seen in the parity distributions in Table
4, Actual effects on behavior were also

10The 3.3 value is simply the weighted mean of
boys plus girls calculated from Table 1. The 4.8 figure is obtained by taking the weighted mean births
required to obtain the population’s desired sex composition (see Sheps, 1963, Table 1, or Bongaarts and
Potter, 1983, Table 9.1). The 4.8 is an approximation because we have assumed the 4+ category
equals 4 and because we have assumed that those
having more than 4 births would have only 2 extra
births to achieve the desired sex preference. These
assumptions could affect the 4.8 estimate by only a
modest amount because relatively few women reported a desired family size larger than 4 children.

evident in the proportion using contraception by parity distribution. We assess the pronatalist impact as substantial, although precise quantification of
its impact is difficult and is not our goal
here.

Throughout we have compared our
results with those of Karki (1988) who
studied Nepal hill populations using
procedures similar to ours. By and
large, empirical results from our studies are very similar (as shown formally
in Table 6). Yet his conclusions deemphasize the import of sex preference
compared to our conclusions. Specifically, Karki (1988, p. 177) notes that
strong sex preference does not mean
that fertility cannot be reduced. In
fact, substantial numbers of women in
Benighat and in Karki’s study wanted
no more children, yet were not using
contraception. Clearly, family planning programs can play a role in reducing this “unmet need” for family planning. This point is a good one, but it
does not suggest that sex preference
is an unimportant factor. Secondly,
Karki argues:

... the percent of couples who do not
have a son decreases quite rapidly as the
number of living children increases.
Thus, only 10 percent of respondents
with three children have no sons. It is
this small group whose contraceptive
and fertility behavior would be affected
by the lack of a son.

This claim is misleading because it
suggests that only small proportions of
parents are dissatisfied with the sex
composition of their families. If only
one son is desired, then only 10 per
cent of those with three children will be
disappointed. But if, as we document,
there is a widespread desire for two
sons and one daughter, then 62 per

Niraula and Morgan

Social Biology

cent of those with three children will
not have this desired composition (see
Bongaarts and Potter, 1983, Table
9.3).

In short Karki reaches the same conclusion as does Arnold (1985, p. 287) in
his examination of Korean data:

... it is likely that son preference will
have some dampening effect on the fertility decline in Korea, but it will not be
a major obstacle to the achievement of
Korea’s fertility goals.

Arnold’s study includes tables like Table 6. We have formally compared the
Arnold results with those from Karki
(1988) and from our study.!! We cannot reject the hypothesis that sex preference is equally strong in all three settings. So differing assessments of the
import of sex preference lie in the investigators’ interpretations not in the
data.

A closer look at Arnold’s evidence
suggests a problem. Specifically, Arnold proposes a measure of sex preference consistent with the following
hypothetical question: How much
would overall levels of contraceptive
use (for instance) change, if at each
parity the behavior of those most satisfied with the sex composition of their
children were shared by all at that parity? The Arnold measure is shown in
Table 7 for Benighat, Karki’s Hill Region data and Arnold’s Korean data.!2

Fit of selected models to data in Table 6 (not
shown here but available upon request from the authors) shows that the additive effects of sons on contraceptive use is identical in all the three settings.
But the conditional effects of one son on contraceptive use increases contraceptive use in Arnold’s Korean population and Karki’s Nepali population,
while two sons increases contraceptive use in both
the Nepali settings and the Korean population has
effects identical to additive effects.

#2Details of calculations for results shown in Table 7 are available from the authors.

“Estimated contraceptive use is the level of contraceptive use in the absence of sex preference, calculated as suggested by Amold,

1985. Calculations available from authors on request.

This measure attributes modest differences to sex preference. The measure’s
fundamental weakness is that it ignores
the effects of sex preferences that operate through past fertility. For instance, and as we noted in the previous
section, the Benighat data (Table 4)
show well over twice as many two-son
families as two-daughter families. The
prevalence of these daughter-only and
son-only families should be relatively
equal. The fact that they are not demonstrates that sex preference acts not
only on current contraceptive use but
also has increased past fertility. In
short, some of those couples using contraception at parity three would have
used contraception at parity two if they
had boys. This effect of sex preference
on fertility (e.g., current parity) is substantial and is ignored in the Arnold
procedure.

In sum, we find strong effects of sex
preference in Benighat. Others who
have presented similar empirical results have downplayed the import of
sex preference. We question these interpretations.

CONCLUSIONS

Benighat women stressed old age
security and continuity of lineage or religious reasons as prominent reasons
for wanting sons. These reasons are

 

similar to those reported by Karki
(1988) for another Nepali hill setting in
1979. They are also similar to answers
given by women in other Asian countries. For example, in Korea and Taiwan, continuity of the family was frequently cited as a reason for wanting a
son, while in the Philippines financial
and economic support was the most
common response (Bulatao, 1975; Wu,
1977; Lee and Kim, 1979). In both
Korea and Taiwan, old age security
was the second most important reason
given for wanting a son.

In addition, the Benighat survey
data and other data from the hill region
(see Karki, 1988) show clearly that
daughters are desired too. This finding
is important, but less often stressed.
The rationale for a degree of balance in
the sex composition comes from the
sharp sexual differentiation in Benighat. The roles played by boys and
girls, and by men and women, are not
functionally interchangeable. Moreover, in Benighat both sexes have important roles to play in their family of
orientation. The roles of sons are more
crucial and more long-term, but daughters also contribute and are valued. As
a result, family size desires are formulated in terms of number of sons and
number of daughters. Number of children desired comes from adding number of sons to number of daughters.

Benighat is an area in the midst of
social change. Just as economic development and new ideas will erode the
supports for large families, they may
erode ideologies and structures that
produce strong sex preferences. But
note that sex preference has its greatest
effects when fertility is controlled (see
Rahman and DaVanzo, 1993). In a
natural fertility setting, desires for a
minimum number of boys (2) and
girls (1) will be met by most as a
result of a large total number of children. For couples with eight children,

Niraula and Morgan

 

Social Biology

96 per cent will have at least two boys
and at least one girl (see Sheps, 1963,
Table 2). Moreover, since there is no
conscious control of fertility in a
“natural’’ fertility regime, sex preferences have no effect on fertility. But
once fertility is controlled, sex preferences can become important pronatalist factors. A realistic impact of
the effect of sex preference can only
be assessed by closely monitoring the
timing, patterns, trends, and behavioral dimensions of fertility decline in
the country.
