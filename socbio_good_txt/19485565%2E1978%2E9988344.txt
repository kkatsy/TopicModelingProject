ABSTRACT: The relationship between early fetal wastage or stillbirth and pregnancy spacing was
examined in a population characterized by prolonged lactation, minimal nutrition, and high
fertility and mortality. The highest risk of early fetal death was found among those pregnancies
conceived less than twelve months after the birth of a surviving breast-fed infant. Lactation as a
possible causal factor is discussed. A significant inverse relationship was apparent for second
trimester fetal deaths and pregnancy intervals, but not for third trimester deaths. This finding is
surprising when one considers that fetal weight gain, and presumably nutrient demand, increases

most rapidly during the third trimester.

The objective of this analysis is to determine the relationship between early
fetal wastage or stillbirth and pregnancy
spacing in a Bangladeshi population
characterized by prolonged lactation, minimal nutrition, and high fertility and mortality. Most previous studies on the relationship between fetal death and pregnancy spacing have shown that fetal mortality is higher among pregnancies preceded by either short or prolonged intervals (Shapiro, 1970; Yerushalmy et al.,
1956; Federick and Alderstein, 1973;
Eastman, 1944).

Several possible mechanisms have been
suggested for the increased risk of fetal
death among pregnancies occurring after
short intervals. Maternal resources are
depleted by a rapid succession of pregnancies which make the mother less able to
carry a pregnancy successfully to term and
produce a viable infant (Yerushalmy et
al., 1956; Eastman, 1944). There is an
abundance of literature showing that both
pregnancy and lactation utilize available
maternal resources at the mother’s expense
(Hytten and Leitch, 1964; Josimovich et
al., 1974; Metz, 1970; Winich, 1971).

Concurrent lactation and pregnancy
would accelerate the depletion of maternal
resources. No evidence was found in the
literature to suggest whether pregnancy or
lactation would take priority if both are
competing for maternal reserves. The possibility that lactation may interfere with a
subsequent pregnancy is based primarily
on inferences from one animal study showing that implantation was delayed in rats
that conceived while still lactating (Hafez
and Ishibashi, 1965).

Insufficient time for endometrial regeneration after a pregnancy termination
may interfere with successful implantation
(Vilee, 1960). Lactational amenorrhea is
the major factor responsible for delaying
pregnancy in this essentially noncontracepting population. Therefore, women
with an infant or fetal death would conceive again soon, possibly perpetuating a
series of unsuccessful pregnancies (Chen,
Gesche, et al., 1974; Chen, Ahmed, et al.,
1974).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data come from an ongoing vital
registration system maintained by the

251

252 Swenson and Harper

Cholera Research Laboratory since 1966
in Matlab thana, an administrative unit of
132 villages about thirty miles southeast of
Dacca, the capital of Bangladesh. Matlab thana includes about three hundred
thousand people with a population density
of approximately two thousand per square
mile (Mosley et al., 1968). During 1966-71
the crude birth rate varied from 40 to 46,

_ the crude death rate from 15 to 17, and

the total fertility rate between 6.0 and 6.6
per thousand (Sirageldin et al., 1975a). A
survey of family planning usage in 196970 showed that only 4 per cent of women
ages 15-45 were using a modern method of
contraception (Sirageldin et al., 1975a).
Although the use of nonconventional contraception cannot be ignored, the high fertility rates suggest that its use is not very
effective.

All births, deaths, and migrations from
the 132 villages of Matlab, known as the
“Old Trial Area,” are recorded on a daily
basis. The registration system is maintained primarily for the surveillance of
diarrheal diseases by the Cholera Research
Laboratory field hospital in Matlab. However, the comprehensive recording of
births and deaths provides valuable data
for fertility and mortality analysis.

An individual Vaccine Trial Serial
number (VTS number) is assigned to each
mother in the registration system. Each
recorded pregnancy termination also contains the mother’s VTS number, making it
possible to link all births for a given
woman In sequential order and to compute
the intervals between pregnancy terminations. The average length of gestation (five
months for early fetal deaths, eight
months for stillbirths, and nine months for
live births) of the second pregnancy in
each interval pair was subtracted from the
event to intervals to obtain the interpregnancy interval. The basic unit of data
analysis consists of pairs of pregnancy
terminations. There were 9,295 such pairs

 

Social Biology

of events occurring to 8,116 women during
the years 1966-71 in the Old Trial Area.
Approximately 12 per cent of the women
contributed more than one interval to the
study population.

In the registration system, live births
were distinguished from nonlive births by
the interviewers asking the mother and
other persons attending the birth about
signs of life such as breathing or muscular
movements. If a pregnancy termination
was determined to be a live birth, no attempt was made to estimate gestational
age. If the pregnancy termination was a
nonlive birth, the field staff would classify
the event as an early fetal wastage or a
stillbirth based on estimates of gestational
age. Gestation was determined from the
mother’s menstrual history as well as from
information about the size, form, and sex
determination of the fetus. If the mother
missed four to six menstrual cycles, nonlive birth was classified as an early fetal
wastage; if she missed seven to nine cycles,
the event was classified as a stillbirth. If
the mother missed three or fewer cycles,
the event was not recorded as a pregnancy
termination. The recording of fetal deaths
is limited to second and third trimester
fetal deaths detected by the mother. The
estimates of gestation are subject to all the
possible sources of error associated with
menstrual histories (Chiazze et al., 1968;
Hobson, 1966; Kamm and Beernich,
1962).

Estimates of induced abortion in Matlab do not appear to be very high (Chen,
Gesche, et al., 1974; Chen, Ahmed, et al.,
1974). One study showed that only about 6
per cent of the maternal deaths were associated with symptoms that could have
been related to septic self-induced abortion (i.e., fetal death occurring in conjunction with symptoms of sepsis). Other studies of maternal mortality in developing
countries have suggested that up to one
half of all maternal deaths occur as a result

Vol. 25, No. 3 Fetal Wastage and
of self-induced abortion (Shorter, and
Bozkurt, 1969). A review of fetal death
records in Matlab showed thai only about
3 per cent of all fetal deaths were described as induced abortions and/or illegitimate pregnancies, Since there was a
daily surveillance of the villages by the
field staff, it was assumed that most successful induced abortions would have been
detected.

Estimates of fetal deaths among aii recorded pregnancy terminations was about
10 per cent. Estimates of fetal wastage
from other epidemiological studies vary
between 5 to 20 per cent of all pregnancy
terminations (Abrahamson, 1973b; James,
1970).

Fetal deaths, although underenumerated because all first trimester fetal deaths
were excluded from the registration system, appear to have been accurately
classified as early fetal deaths (second
trimester) or stillbirths (third trimester
fetal deaths). Consistent with other studies, these data indicate that more than
twice as many fetal deaths occur in the
second as in the third trimester (Abrahamson, 19736; French and Bierman, 1962;
Hammes and Treolar, 1970; James, 1970;
Mellin, 1962; Shapiro et al., 1962).

BINARY REGRESSION ANALYSIS

A binary regression analysis was used to
adjust for selected maternal factors (pregnancy order, age of the mother, history of
previous pregnancy and child losses, and
outcome of the first pregnancy of the
interval). The adjusted rates of early fetal
wastage and stillbirth represent the risk of
an individual in that interval category experiencing an early fetal wastage or a
stillbirth given that the other selected maternal factors are held constant.

When the independent and dependent
variables are binary, the regression can be
expressed by the following general linear
model where each X;; represents a subclass

Pregnancy Spacing 253

of a factor (such as the interpregnancy

interval, pregnancy order, etc.) and the Y;
represents the outcome variable.

where
i= 1, 2,3,...N observations;
Y, = 1 if it results in mortality;

O if it results in survival;

X= 1 if it results in mortality;
= 0 if it results in survival;
t = index for subclasses;
€; = random error for each observation.
By = regression coefficient for the Tth

subclass. The adjusted rates are calculated
for each subclass of a factor (k*) after thes
have been estimated. The computing formula for the adjusted rate is:

mk
Pe = Bo + Bert > >, BusX eg

Bo = the intercept;
Bust = the regression coefficient for thé th
subclass of factor k*;
m, = the total number of subclasses for
the factor k;
j = the index for subclasses within a

factor;
k = the index for the factors.

The significant difference between the
adjusted rates for two subclasses were determined by the following computation
which treats the differences between the
two adjusted rates like the differences between two means.

The Z statistic is assumed to follow a
standard normal distribution; AR, and
AR, are the adjusted rates from the two
subclasses being SEyr, and SEgp, are the
standard errors of the two adjusted rates.
The level of significance was taken at the
0.05 level.

RESULTS

The adjusted rates in Table 1 show almost a six-fold higher risk of early fetal
wastage among pregnancies conceived less
than twelve months after the preceding
pregnancy termination compared to those
conceived more than twenty-four months
later. The adjusted rates for stillbirth mortality are 19 per cent higher among pregnancies preceded by less than twelvemonth intervals compared to those preceded by intervals of twelve or more
months. However, these differences in
stillbirth mortality are not significant.

Table 2 shows that the highest risk of
early fetal death is among those pregnancies conceived less than twelve months
after the birth of a surviving breast-fed
infant (LBA). Among pregnancies preceded by intervals less than twelve
months, those preceded by the birth of a
surviving breast-fed infant (LBA) have an
early fetal wastage rate almost four times
as high as those preceded by a nonlive
birth (NLB).

The inverse relationship between the
early fetal wastage and the length of the
interval is only apparent when the preceding pregnancy is a surviving live birth

(Table 2). It is difficult to make conclusions where the preceding event was an
infant death (LBD) or a nonlive birth
(NLB) because of the small number of
cases with an interval greater than twelve
months following an LBD or an NLB.
There is probably some undetected fetal
wastage in the longer intervals, especially
those following an infant death or a nonlive birth. Since the maximal period of
follow-up was sixty months and fewer
than twenty cases had intervals longer
than thirty-six months, the relationship
between prolonged intervals and the risk
of fetal mortality was not evaluated in
more detail in this study.

The specific effects of previous pregnancy losses on the relationship between
the length of the interval and fetal mortality is examined in Table 3. The history of

DISCUSSION

The findings differ from previous studies in several ways. First, the large difference (six-fold) in early fetal wastage between short and long intervals was largely
accounted for by the group preceded by a
surviving, breast-fed infant (Table 2).
Lactation data were not available on this
study population, but a prospective study
of two hundred women from Matlab
found that 93 per cent of women with a
surviving live birth were breast-feeding,
at least partially, up to twelve months
post-partum. These observations suggest
that lactation may be a causal factor.
There are three possible reasons for such

previous pregnancy losses is of particular
importance since it is closely associated
both with the length of intervals between
pregnancies and with risk of fetal mortality (Abrahamson, 1973a,b; Kamm and
Beernich, 1962; Shapiro, 1970). Early
fetal wastage and stillbirth rates are consistently higher among the pregnancies of
mothers with a history of two or more
pregnancy losses. However, those pregnancies preceded by short intervals have
the highest risk of both early fetal and

an association. (1) Lactation may interfere
with a subsequent pregnancy if the second
pregnancy occurs while lactation is still
intensive since many of the critical endocrine and metabolic changes of pregnancy
occur during the first two months. The
lack of information on first trimester fetal
deaths limits this interpretation. Nevertheless, if one assumes that the distribution of fetal deaths is the same in this
population as in others, the trends observed among second trimester fetal

deaths would also persist for first trimester
deaths. (2) Women who have short intervals following a surviving live birth may
be less capable of breast-feeding for various health reasons (such as malnutrition
and illness), and thus they may lose the
contraceptive effect of lactation and may
conceive again earlier. If the group who
conceive less than twelve months after a
surviving live birth are weighted with less
healthy individuals, they may also be
more likely to experience early fetal wastage. (3) Induced abortion may account for
a part of the higher msk of early fetal
wastage following a surviving infant.
However, only limited data on abortion in
this population are available.

Another difference between these
findings and those of previous studies is
that the significant inverse relationship between second trimester fetal deaths and
pregnancy intervals was not apparent for
third trimester fetal deaths. This was surprising since fetal weight gain, and presumably nutrient demand, increases most
rapidly during the third trimester (Winich,
1971).

A study of Wolfers in Columbia, South
America, showed that the risk of stillbirth
was highest among pregnancies preceded
by intervals less than six months (Wolfers
and Scrimshaw, 1975). A study in England showed a significant increase in
stillbirth among pregnancies preceded by
short intervals. However, this association

Swenson and Harper

Social Biology

was not significant after adjustments for
age of the mother and social class
(Federick and Alderstein, 1973). Another
study which did not adjust for other maternal factors showed about a 30 per cent
higher risk of stillbirth among closely
spaced pregnancies (Yerushalmy et al.,
1956). Assuming that the depletion of maternal resources by closely spaced pregnancies would be accelerated in this malnourished population, it was anticipated
that stillbirth would be significantly higher
among the closely spaced pregnancies.
The crude rates show that intervals less
than twelve months have a 35 per cent
higher risk of stillbirth compared to the
longer intervals. After adjustment for the
other maternal factors, there is only a 19
per cent higher stillbirth rate among pregnancies with intervals less than twelve
months (Table 1) compared to the longer
intervals. We have no explanation for
these latter findings.
