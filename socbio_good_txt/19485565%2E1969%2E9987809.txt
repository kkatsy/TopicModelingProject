A Methodological Note on Research Design

It is frequently argued that experimental
design is an inappropriate approach to the
study of social engineering projects. The
basis of this argument is that treatment
variance is proscribed by an experimental
design. Furthermore, one desideratum in
social engineering is the use of feedback for
improvement of treatment. Thus, the two
are in principle incompatible (see Freymann
and Lionberger, 1962). Investigators so
arguing are discussing what type of research
is possible and hence are involved in a discussion on the methodological as opposed
to the practical level. If it can be shown,
in principle, that experimental design can
be integrated with feedback and treatment
change, the argument of incompatibility
will be shown false.

Whether conditions for experimental design, such as random assignment, are realized, in fact, is a practical problem and
will not concern us here. For instance, in
family-planning programs, the ethical concern to transmit information and contraceptive devices to the total population will not
permit random assignment to a control

group; but this is a policy decision and not
methodological in nature.

We will examine an experimental design
which is derived from the general linear
model (Mendenhall, 1968; Fennessey, 1968).
We then show how treatment change can
be incorporated within the model; thus, our
arguments, while employing a constructive
proof, will have a measure of scope.

From the general linear model we generate the one independent variable, case Yo,
with y the criterion measure continuous
throughout:

VY, = Qo + %41(a1 + a2%2) + €,

where € is a stochastic variable of zero mean
and unit variance. Let x; and x2, be dummy
variables such that

\ if 4 is in the experimental group,
1 = Z
0 otherwise

and
= \" if Yo is disseminated,
? O otherwise.

If z is in the control group, we have

=aate.

Hence, ao is the population mean. If 7 is in
the experimental group, then we have

y=anotate;

and by an appropriate test of significance,
if the means are

aoX~ata,

there is a treatment effect and we reject the
null hypothesis. On the other hand, if

Go = ao +a,

then there are no differential effects across
treatment levels and we accept the null
hypothesis.

The structure of our model dictates that
the only case where a reaction to disserr ination can occur is for x; = 1. If a rational
program manager reacts to Yo, then x, = 1,
and we find

y=atatate.

Here a» is the measure of the rational :nanager’s response to dissemination. ‘“hen
(a; + a2) can be considered the cumulative
treatment.

If Y1, incorporating (a: ~+ a2) as treatment, is disseminated, then a3 will be the

measure of the manager’s further response.
This can be induced, after (” — 1) disseminations, to the series

y=ootart darte.

we have the Cauchy sequence Y,
y* = ao tay+ lim >a,
N-PO {22

which can be represented as

Na tan Sag al Gg asses eal
Hence, y* = ya:p for (p => 0), and as anip
(%n4p) = 0, the manager has ceased to react
to dissemination. So y* becomes the stable
criterion value, and a; + Z7_2a; the stable
cumulative treatment.

Thus treatment change, as a function of
rational response to evaluation feedback,
can exist in the context of a program being
studied by an experimental design of the
classical variety.
