Trends in Moslem Fertility and the Application
of the Demographic Transition Model

ABSTRACT: Presented are data on fertility levels in thirty Moslem countries between 1960 and
1980. Fertility measures include: crude birth rate, total fertility rate and age-specific birth rate,
and the per cent change in them between 1960 and 1980. The analysis focuses on: (1) the current
status of Moslem fertility, (2) the emerging fertility differentials among Moslem countries, and
(3) the degree to which recent fertility declines in some Moslem countries is associated with
modernization variables and family planning efforts. Results indicate that: (a) Moslem fertility
remains universally high and is generally higher than non-Moslem countries in the same region;
(b) few Moslem countries have succeeded in reducing their levels of fertility to justify a search
for the predictors of Moslem fertility levels; (c) in spite of a sufficient range of variations in the
economic and social correlates of fertility, the corresponding fertility variables in these countries do not suggest that the reproductive behavior of Moslem women has reacted to such variations; and (d) efforts directed toward stronger family planning programs are clearly related to

fertility decline.

Demographers have long recognized
that values concerning fertility are embedded in religious beliefs and that the
high fertility of some societies is in part a
response to religious doctrine. The precepts of religion are believed to sustain
the traditions of large families in many
developing countries.

Numerous demographers have taken
the view that Roman Catholicism with
its general condemnation of contraception has been a powerful factor in upholding large family norms especially in
Latin America.(Day, 1968; Francis,
1975). Others believe that the most pronatalist of all the major world religions
can be found in Islam. In his very detailed survey of the relation between
culture and human fertility, Lorimer
(1954) stated: ‘“‘“Mohammedanism gives
strong and unequivocal emphasis to
high fertility, and Mohammedan social
structures universally support high fer
tility” (1954, p. 186). More recently
Kirk (1968) has reaffirmed that the level
of fertility among Islamic societies is almost always very high, generally higher
than that of other major religious
groups. As Kirk stated: “Empirically Islam has been a more effective barrier to
the diffusion of family planning than Catholicism (1968, p. 231). Kirk attributed
the high birth rate in Moslem countries
not only to religious doctrine but also to
“distinctive Islamic attitudes and practices in family life.”

Scholars of Islam hold different views
with regard to whether Islam encourages people to have children, or whether
it forbids the use of birth control methods (Khan, 1945, 1961). Some maintain
that the pronatalist tendencies in Jslam
stem less from direct injunctions to procreate than from the support of conditions that produce high fertility
(Seklani, 1960). They maintain that fer
245

tility control is not prohibited in Islam
and that the purpose of marriage in Islam is held to be not only for procreation
but also for the gratification of spiritual
and physical needs. The Quaran has historically been interpreted as justifying
coitus interpetus to protect the male’s
property, to preserve the wife’s health,
and to allay anxiety over numerous children.

Today Moslem Jurists support measures to prevent conception, and in several Moslem countries religious leaders
have endorsed family planning programs. Only abortion and sterilization
still meet with strong opposition from
religious authorities. Nonetheless, the
opinion has been repeatedly expressed
that Islam may offer a prolonged resistance to fertility decline because of the
institutional pressures among its population to have many children, especially
sons, because of the low status of
women, and because the population of
almost all Moslem countries consists
largely of culturally conservative peasantry (Abd-Ati, 1975; Driver, 1963;
Mazur, 1967; Rizk, 1963). Such pronatalist sentiment in Islam can be seen in
the emphasis put on early and universal
marriage, easy marriage of divorcees,
and limited career opportunities for
women outside the home.

While the controversy as to whether
Islam encourages large families continues, some studies (United Nations,
1971) contend that high fertility of Moslem women may have been encouraged
by: (1) a fatalistic attitude in Islam stemming from a strong belief in the active
providence of God; (2) the shyness of
Moslem women which stymied their interest in fertility regulation; and (3) the
choice of family limitation methods—
the IUD, for example, may not be readily acceptable to Moslem couples be

cause of spotting and bleeding which
may render the woman ritually unclean.

However, in contrast to Catholicism,
there is no clear doctrinal injunction
against most methods of birth control. It
was suggested that such lack of religious
injunctions against methods of birth
control may actually prove to be a
double-edged sword (Fiset, 1969). Variations in interpretations of what constitute acceptable practices in Islam could
conceivably allow the acceptance of
contraceptive techniques or could conversely effect a back-lash against fertility
control programs.

Regardless of how one interprets Islam’s position on nuptiality, much has
become known during the last twenty
years, both empirically and conceptually, about trends in Moslem fertility
that require integration and interpretation. Specifically there is a need to: (1)
examine recent trends in Moslem fertility during the sixties and the seventies;
(2) compare and contrast fertility trends
and differentials not only to nonMoslem countries, but also among Moslem countries themselves; and (3) explain trends in Moslem fertility in
accordance with the prevailing assumptions about fertility decline—namely,
those of the demographic transition
model—and family planning, as well as
age of marriage and the infant mortality
hypotheses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study covers thirty countries in
which Islam is the religion of more than
60 per cent of the total population. The
majority of these countries, but not all
of them, are members of the Islamic
conference. There are many other millions of Moslems in the world that are

not included in this survey, representing
substantial minority groups in other
countries. Reference to what we already
know about the fertility level of these
minorities is made for comparative purposes where appropriate.

The analysis of this paper is based on
demographic and socioeconomic data
and reports published by the World
Bank, Population Council, World Fertility Survey, and Population Information Program. The measure of fertility
applied in this study include Crude Birth
Rate (CBR), Total Fertility Rate
(TFR), and Age-specific Birth Rate
(ASBR).

In order to organize the analysis of
the conditions affecting fertility changes
in the Moslem countries, three general
sets of factors are quantified. These general factors are: demographic, socioeconomic, and family planning. Demographic measures include infant
mortality rates, life expectancy, age of
marriage, and the percentage of women
aged 15-45 in the female population. Indicators of socioeconomic development
are represented by scores on seven variables measuring: education, health, economic structure, and urbanization.
The seven variables measuring socioeconomic changes represent a part of
the general socioeconomic movement
called development or modernization
and presumably affect motivation for
fertility control. These variables are as
follows: (1) education; adult literacy
(ages 15 and over), primary and secondary school enrollment as a percentage of
the 5-19 age group, (2) health; life expectancy at birth, infant mortality, (3)
economy; GNP per capital, percentage
of adult males in the nonagricultural labor force, (4) urbanization; percentage
of population living in cities of
100,000 +.

RESULTS
FERTILITY LEVELS AND TRENDS

Data on the CBR in the years 1960
and 1980 and per cent decline are presented in Table 1. As the figures clearly
indicate, crude birth rates were well
over 45 for all the Moslem countries in
1960. Lebanon and Turkey were the
only exceptions where the CBR was 43.
Ten of the Moslem countries had birth
rates of 50 and over. In 1980 only four
countries had rates of 50 and over.
These are Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania,
and Niger, all African countries.

On the whole, the majority of the
Moslem countries experienced some decline in CBR between 1960 and 1980.
The most noticeable decrease took
place in the rates of Tunisia, Egypt, and
Morocco (North Africa), Lebanon and
Turkey (Southwest Asia), Bangladesh
(Middle South Asia), and Malaysia and
Indonesia (Southeast Asia).

Between 1960 and 1980, the rates
show hardly any decline in the Moslem
countries of Africa (south of the Sahara).

For a more general conclusion, it is
significant to note that without exception, the 1980 CBR for the 30 Moslem
countries included in this study were
much higher than the non-Moslem
countries in the same region of the
world. The CBR for the Moslem countries were also well above the regional
average (Population Reference Bureau,
1980). It may be said that the situation
around the 1980’s remains more or less
similar to that observed by Kirk in the
early sixties. At that time Moslem fertility was (and still is) almost universally
high, and it was generally higher than
that of neighboring peoples of other major religions. The 1980’s, however, show
a definite trend toward differential fer

tility among Moslem countries. The recent experience of several countries
bringing down their CBR, (particularly
those of:Malaysia, Indonesia, Tunisia,
Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, and Morocco) points to a rather wide range of
variability in the CBR of Moslem countries at the beginning of the 1980’s (note
the highest CBR was 52 for Niger and
the lowest was 30 for Lebanon). Thus,
there is sufficient range of variation in

tries to justify a search for the predictors
of Moslem nuptiality levels.

TFR and trends in the fertility level
also presented in Table 1 are more or
less similar to those observed in the
analysis of CBR. Again the countries
with the lowest levels of fertility are the
same ones shown before—namely, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Tunisia, and
Egypt. In 16 of these countries, the TFR
was 6.5 or higher in 1980. Furthermore,

tries was noticeably higher than those
for non-Moslem countries in the same
region, and substantially much higher
than the world average of 3.8. The rates
for these Moslem countries were even
higher than the 4.4 average for the less
developed countries (Population Reference Bureau, 1980). Although the need
to rely on different data year base (1970)
precludes any definite conclusions per_jtaining to observed declines since 1970,
othe rates for 1970 and 1980 clearly support the conclusions pertaining to (1)
rethe very high fertility characteristic of
oMoslem populations in general, and (2)
Athe wide range of variation in the fertility levels of the different Islamic countries.
co Further evidence of the existence of
significant differences in the fertility be‘shavior of Islamic populations is revealed
-aby the age-specific birth rates presented
.2in Table 2. The data from the 11 coun=tries for which comparable rates are
S available clearly reveals the lack of a sin‘agle pattern that can describe the fertility
Sexperience of the Moslem world. Nevertheless, several interesting observa“> tions can be drawn from this table. First,
— there is a very wide range in the level of
gfertility of young Moslem women, from
Sa very high rate in Bangladesh to a low
rate in Egypt. This wide fertility range
Aamong young women age 15-19 can be
explained partly by differences in the legal age of marriage. In addition it probably reflects differences in the percentage
of women age 15-19 who were married,
their contraceptive behavior, and, possibly, differences in adolescent subfecundity. Second, Moslem women seem
to continue to be reproductively active
at a much later age (40 and over) than
women in Western societies. Finally,
the few countries that experienced noticeable TFR declines also experienced

Moslem Fertility

 

249

decreases in the fertility of both young
and old women. Tunisia, however, represents an anomaly in which birth rates
for young women increased between
1971 and 1976 while the TFR declined.

The trends in age-specific fertility
rates reveal some regional differences as
well. First, declining fertility among
young women was noticeable in Malaysia and Indonesia from 1967 to 1975.
However, fertility decline was at a
slightly slower rate among younger
women than among older women in Indonesia. In contrast, in Malaysia and
Bangladesh fertility declined somewhat
faster among younger women than
among older women. In the Middle
East, on the other hand, decreases in the
fertility of older women seem to be
more significant than the decrease in fertility among younger women. The only
exception here occurred in Bahrain,
where fertility declines were more pronounced at the younger ages. Thus,
even where similar downward trends in
total fertility can be observed they may
reflect markedly different patterns of
decline with respect to the ages of the
women participating; and these differences in turn will be very important in
determining the nature of programs
aimed at promoting further declines in
overall fertility.

scores and the CBR discussed above.
Those countries that have experienced
relatively large declines in fertility since
the early 1960’s (Lebanon, Malaysia,
Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, In
 

donesia, and Bangladesh) are scattered
all up and down the social rank continuum; and some of the highest ranked
countries (e.g., Jordan and Libya) have
experienced little change in their high
fertility levels in the past twenty years.

A generally similar conclusion would
be suggested by an examination of the
seven specific socioeconomic measures
presented in Table 4. Once again, those
countries that appear to be relatively
better off in terms of several of these
measures are countries that have experienced little or no change in their crude
birth rates. For example, compared to
the rest of the Moslem countries, those
that can be identified as Arab countries
have, with few exceptions, higher rates
of urbanization, nonagricultural employment, per capita GNP, and life expectancy; yet most of these countries
have reported little or no change in
S.

A major assumption of classical dem

ographic transition theory is that high
infant mortality results in high fertility,
either because parents try to replace
those children who die or because they
strive to produce enough children to ensure the survival of a sufficient number
of children to guarantee a source of support in their old age as well as the continuation of the family line (Scrimshaw,
1978). Accordingly, this explanation
would postulate a decline in mortality as
a precondition to any reductions in fertility; conversely, the persistence of a
high level of infant mortality can be expected to inhibit a decline in the birth
rate.

One reason for the persistence of
high birth rates among Moslem coun

tries, even those that rank fairly high on
several development indexes, may be
the existence of fairly high infant mortality rates (i.e., with the exception of
Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Malaysia, all Islamic countries covered in Table 4 had infant mortality rates well in
excess of 100). While there may be some
sound basis for arguing that mortality
decline is necessary for fertility decline,
this is no guarantee that the former will
lead to the latter. In the present analysis, for.example, Kuwait and Malaysia
both had infant mortality rates of 41; but
Kuwait has had a fairly stable high birth
rate throughout the period since 1960,
whereas that of Malaysia has declined
by roughly 30 per cent. Similarly, a relatively low infant mortality rate is associated with a notable fertility decline in
Lebanon but with the persistence of a
very high CBR in Jordan. Thus, the degree of correspondence that Is generally
assumed between the epidemiological
transition and fertility decline does not
always apply (Omran, 1977), and the
idea that a substantial decline in infant
mortality will automatically encourage a
corresponding reduction in fertility 1s
not substantiated in the case of the Moslem countries examined here.

One other variable requires some discussion, and that is education. According to much of the literature, education
tends to have a markedly depressing effect on fertility. With education comes a
broadening of one’s horizons, increased
knowledge, a breakdown in traditional
attitudes and beliefs, and a variety of
other social psychological accompaniments of modernization (e.g., a stronger
achievement orientation)—all of which
are likely to encourage effects to gain a
greater measure of control over one’s
fertility (Hawthorn, 1970; Durch,
1981).

Although an adequate assessment of

Nagi

Social Biology

the relative importance for fertility decline of the several variables presented
in Table 4 requires a more sophisticated
Statistical analysis than can be undertaken here, there is some evidence to
support this thesis. For example, those
countries which have experienced the
greatest fertility declines since 1960
(Lebanon, Malaysia, Turkey, Tunisia,
Indonesia) tend to have higher rates of
literacy and/or a higher percentage of
the eligible population enrolled in primary or secondary school. Conversely,
those countries with the highest crude
birth rates today (Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria) generally rank very low on
both these measures. Once again, however, there are some notable exceptions: Jordan and Iraq, for example,
both rank fairly high on the two education measures, yet both are characterized by persistent high birth rates, a pattern which is also somewhat characteristic of Kuwait, Libya, and Syria. Thus,
once again there is only a weak association between the expectations of transition theory and Moslem fertility behavior.

To summarize briefly: Classical
demographic transition theory bases its
expectation of declining fertility on the
onset of the modernization process and
empirically measurable improvements
in the social and economic well-being of
a population; but the evidence presented here for the Moslem countries
fails to give credence to many of the hypotheses implied in this demographic
transition model. The major problems
noted can be summed up as follows:

(1) Economic activity rates, urbanization, and improvement in health, per
capita GNP, and even in educational
level are not obviously related to overall
fertility levels in most of the Middle
Eastern and North African countries.

(2) In Africa, neither urbanization

fertility.

(3) The Moslem countries that experienced clear fertility decline exhibit different combinations of the traits enumerated.

(4) The country that has recently
shown a steep fertility decline (Indonesia) exhibits little aggregate social
change that can explain its rapidly declining fertility.

It seems reasonable then to conclude

that the emergence of fertility differences among Moslem countries can
hardly be attributed to a clear association with aggregate socioeconomic
changes commonly assumed to be part
of the demographic transition (Teitelbaum, 1975),

nomic development as opposed to vigorous family planning programs to the
onset and maintenance of fertility decline in the Third World countries of
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. On
the one hand, there are those who adhere to the classical demographic transition model with its expectation of declining fertility as a response to the
modernization process and empirically
measurable changes in the social and economic well-being of a population. On
the other hand, there are those who see
the key to fertility decline in an active
and vigorous family planning program.”
In this section we shall consider the relative influence of family planning efforts.

Table 5 presents data on the 1968-75
percentage decline in the total fertility
rate of Moslem countries that have been
grouped on the basis of the strength of
their family planning program efforts.
This classification was developed by
Mauldin and Berelson and is based on
the availability or lack of a variety of
family planning services. Individual
country scores range from 0-26, with
scores of 20 or more taken to indicate a
strong family planning program, 10-19 a
moderate program, and 0-9 a weak program.° An examination of Table 5
clearly reveals the importance of family
planning efforts for fertility decline in
the Islamic world. Among countries
with no program the declines in the total
fertility rate between 1970 and 1980
ranged from +17 to —15 per cent, with

clines ranged from 16 to 31 per cent,
with an overall average decline of 21 per
cent. It is also significant to note, especially in view of persistent high fertility
among Moslem populations in general,
that none of the countries included in
this analysis had a family planning program that could be classified as
“strong.” Nevertheless, while the experience of the Moslem countries does not
add strong support to the modernization
hypothesis for explaining fertility decline, it does point to the importance of
government supported family planning
programs.

Previous analysis of the factors responsible for fertility decline in less developed countries shows that family
planning program efforts add substantially to fertility decline when combined
with the social and economic variables
of modernization (Mauldin and
Berelson, 1978; Oechsli and Kirk,

1975). Table 6, which cross-classifies
countries according to both socioeconomic status and family planning program effort, permits an examination of
this proposition for Moslem countries.
The family planning classification used
is the same one shown in Table 5, while
the socioeconomic index is an overall
score based on the seven specific measures shown in Table 4.

Some of the more significant observations to be drawn from this table,
which again points to the importance of
family-planning efforts, are as follows.
First, those four countries that fall into
the moderate family planning program
(Iran, Malaysia, Tunisia, and Indonesia) all have shown a notable decrease in
fertility regardless of their position in
the socioeconomic status category. Conversely, all 14 countries that fall into no
family planning program, regardless of
their position in the socioeconomic sta

tus category, show no decline or an increase in TFR. The only exception was
Kuwait. Second, those four countries
that fell into the high socioeconomic status category, and did not have a family
planning program, have not shown any
notable decrease in fertility, Kuwait being an exception. Similarly, those 10
countries that fell into the lower socioeconomic status category had little or no
decrease in fertility.

The major conclusions to be drawn
from the cross-classification presented
in Table 6 are as follows: (1) Fertility reduction in those few Moslem countries
showing a definite declining trend can
clearly be related to family-planning efforts. (2) Socioeconomic changes in the
absence of family planning efforts have
produced little, if any, decline in fertility. (3) When the two factors are combined it is clear that family planning efforts exert a greater influence on fertility
decline than socioeconomic changes.

STATUS OF WOMEN AND FERTILITY
DECLINE

Although a direct connection remains to be established, the subordinate
position of women, which appears to be
an entrenched part of the Moslem culture, is usually suggested as an important factor maintaining fertility of Moslem women at a higher level (Allman,
1978). Status of women can be measured in many different ways. Although
not always acceptable as indicators,’
changes in women’s status are thought
to be reflected in matters related to
women’s ability to exercise their rights
in marriage, divorce, education, work,

‘This approach has been criticized as having an
evaluative approach along the Western experience
(see Safilios-Rothschilds, 1970).

Social Biology

and participation in public life (Curtin,
1982; Dixon, 1975).

Researchers who investigated the relationships between the status of Moslem women and their fertility behavior
isolated several factors as possible interpretive linkages between the two sets of
variables. Youssif (1978) explained the
position of the single women in Moslem
countries as being most precarious
which leads toward (1) seclusion of
women from the larger society, (2) restricted employment outside the home,
and (3) tight parental control and supervision of early marriage.

Changes in the age at marriage are
normally accompanied by a variety of
socioeconomic changes that reflect and
are part of the modernization process.
One of the great difficulties in studying
age at marriage and fertility ties is determining what cause and effects relationships exist among age at marriage, fertility, and socioeconomic factors. Intensive investigation of this topic demonstrates that the relationship between age
at first marriage and fertility is not always as simple as had been previously
assumed. It is generally believed however that delayed marriage has played a
significant role in the fertility decline of
some Western countries (Yaukey, 1965;
Hajnal, 1965; Dixon, 1971, 1978).

Understandably, the relationship between age at marriage and fertility
changes in Moslem countries should be
most relevant since it is repeatedly asserted that (1) Moslem culture encourages early female marriage and insures
almost universal marriage and (2) because of the strict sexual conduct in
Moslem culture, marriage represents
the socially sanctioned initiation of sexual activities and childbearing for
women.

Patterns in Moslem countries range

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

Vol. 30, No. 3

from early marriage and high fertility to
relatively late marriage and moderate
fertility (Population Information Program, 1979). Early marriage is less common in the Southeast Asian countries of
Indonesia and Malaysia where fertility is
also much lower. In contrast, Moslem
women in Sub-Saharan Africa marry
young; marriage close to the age of menarche is common in most Islamic parts of
Africa and marriage is nearly universal.
Total Fertility Rates are very high in
these countries, well over the 6.2 average of the African countries as a whole.
In the Arab world there is a great variation in age of marriage and fertility levels. Though one can assume that the tradition of early marriage prevalent in
most of the Moslem countries in somehow responsible for maintaining high
levels of fertility, there are several exceptions that make such a generalization
tenous. Syria, for example, has a relatively low percentage of females mar

ried at age 15-19 years but exhibits one
of the highest fertility rates.

One way to gauge the contribution of
delayed marriage to declining fertility is
to compare the changes in fertility rates
among younger women with the
changes in fertility rates among older
women. It is assumed here that most of
the declines in fertility among younger
women are due to latter marriage, and
most of the declines among older
women are due to use of contraception.

Table 7 displays comparative data on
the relative contribution to fertility decline of these age groups for the few
Moslem countries where data are availabile. As these figures indicate, declining
fertility among young women (less than
age 25) accounted for substantial proportions of the total fertility decline in
Malaysia and Indonesia. In three of the
Middle Eastern countries, Egypt, Tunisia, and Turkey, declining fertility
among younger women (less than 25)

has not been largely responsible for the
drop in the total fertility note. Fertility
change among women under 25 accounted for only 20 per cent of the decline in the total fertility rate in Egypt
and 28 per cent in Turkey (see Table 7).
In Bahrain, declining fertility among
younger women has been a major factor
in the overall fertility decline between
1965 and 1966; about 16 per cent of the
decline occurred among the youngest
age group and 42 per cent among
women age 20-24, or a total of 58 per
cent among women under 25. A marriage squeeze, caused by high birth rates
before 1970, the custom of men marrying women 5 to 10 years younger than
they, and the out-migration of men,
may have been major causes of delay in
Bahrain marriage (Deming and Van
Arsdol, 1980).

The birth rate may be reduced either
by decreases in the marital fertility rate
due to family planning or due to a decrease in the population married. Thus,
by knowing the proportion of women
who have ever been married by age, we
are able to illustrate not only how early
women marry but also how rapidly and
how thoroughly marriage spreads
through the female population.

The available results from the World
Fertility Survey (WFS) indicate some
patterns that are relevant to Moslem fertility. At the time the survey was conducted, there was a great deal of variation among Moslem countries in respect
to how widespread early marriage was
among their populations. For example,
while about 70 per cent of the 15-19year-old women in Bangladesh were
married, only 53 per cent were married
in Malaysia and closer to 37 per cent in
each of Pakistan and Indonesia. The
results of the survey, however, show

Nagi

Social Biology

that between 20-24 some 80 per cent of
women were married and between ages
25-50 about 99 per cent of women were
married (Durch, 1981).

What these findings clearly indicate is
that the presumed value of delayed marriage in reducing fertility may be limited, if such delay merely results in compressing the time it takes for most
women to marry, a pattern which appears to be prevailing in Moslem society. Universal marriage is the rule in
most Moslem countries.

Just as marriage increases the likelihood of childbearing, marital dissolution decreases it. Though, it is a common Western belief that divorce is much
easier among the Moslem population,
there is a wide variation among Moslem
countries in the prevalence of divorce.
In Asia, for example, levels of divorce
are not really linked with religion. A
high level of divorce exists in Indonesia,
and a low level in Pakistan, although
both are predominately Moslem. In the
Middle East, while Egypt has one of the
highest divorce rates, Syria has one of
the lowest rates (Momeni, 1972; Buza
and Baldwin, 1977).

The timing of divorce and remarriage
of women also affect fertility. For example, divorce at early age has a different
effect on fertility than divorce at a later
age. Similarly, divorce followed almost
immediately by remarriage has little effect on fertility, while divorce not followed immediately by remarriage could
have a depressing effect on fertility.
Once again, the published data on the
World Fertility Survey (WFS) have
some bearing on these issues. The
results show that in the median countries where data were available, marital
dissolution due to divorce is most common among older women whose fecun

dity is lowest. The easy marriage of divorced women in Moslem countries is
also a common practice (Durch, 1981).
In brief, in most Moslem countries, an
average woman of reproductive age,
once married, spent a very large proportion of her time in a marital union.

To summarize briefly, the trend toward relatively later marriage in several
Moslem countries has produced little effect on the overall level of marriage and
does not appear to be a significant factor
in fertility decline except in Malaysia,
Indonesia, and Tunisia (Brown and
Wry, 1974; Taylor, 1975; Hassan, 1975).

The age structure of a population and
particularly the percentage of women in
the reproductive age group has an effect
on fertility. Table 8 presents data on the
percentage of women in the reproductive age group and TFR in 1980. The
range of this age group, in Moslem
countries, is rather narrow and is set between 15 and 44. It is interesting to note
though that the countries which show
the percentage of women in the reproductive age group as less than 42 per
cent have relatively higher TFR’s. The
14 countries that fall in this range had
TFR is of 6.5 and over, and 3 of them
had TFR’s of 7 and over. It is interesting
to note that, conversely, the countries
that have more than 43 per cent of
women in the reproductive age group
have relatively lower TFR’s. these countries are Indonesia, Egypt, Tunisia,
Lebanon, Malaysia, and Turkey.

This pattern is hard to explain. It is
possible however, that a relative shortage of marriageable females reinforces
the societal push toward both earlier age
at marriage and universal marriage.
This phenomena of a possible ‘“‘marriage
boom’’ stands in contrast to what is
known about other cases of “marriage

level of fertility for thirty Moslem counDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

tries. On the basis of the evidence, the
author questioned the impact of religion
on fertility level in these countries. In
general, Moslem fertility was found to
be universally high, and noticeably
higher than that of non-Moslem countries at similar levels of development.

This paper’s analysis shows, however,
that fertility transition appears to be underway in at least six or seven of these
Moslem countries. In the rest of the
Moslem world, fertility has shown little
or no trend toward sustained decline.

The most striking finding to emerge
from the data ts that in the few countries
where fertility has started to decline it
has often declined under remarkably adverse socioeconomic and demographic
conditions. The data present no clear
evidence that aggregate indicators of socioeconomic development would explain the timing of fertility decline.

Clearly, large differences in the level
of development exist among the thirty
Moslem countries, and it seems safe to
conclude that there is no easily definable
threshold of social and economic progress required for their fertility to begin
to decline.

The evidence gathered for these
thirty countries show a generally high
level of infant mortality in Moslem
countries. Such high infant mortality
prevalent in these countries may in part
explain their high level of fertility.
However, the hypothesis that a substantial decline in infant mortality will automatically produce a corresponding reduction in fertility is not substantiated in
the case of the countries examined here.
The two countries which had the lowest
rates of infant mortality (Kuwait and
Malaysia) have very dissimilar TFR’s.

Of the thirty countries surveyed in
this study, rising age of marriage has
contributed substantially to fertility decline in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Tuni

sia. In other countries, rising age of marriage has. not always been associated
with decrease in fertility. In fact, some
paradoxical cases can be observed
where increase in age at marriage was
accompanied by an increase in the fertility of young women 15-19, (Tunisia).

Although the association between
rising age at marriage and fertility reduction showed an inconsistent pattern
among the thirty countries, there are in
our opinion at least three reasons to believe that rising age at marriage could
have a noticeable impact on fertility decline in the Moslem countries in comparison to other regions: (1) In the few
Moslem countries where fertility level
has been falling rapidly, delayed marriage was partially responsible for such
decline, along with other factors, in particular, effective family planning programs. (2) In the Moslem countries,
marriage signifies the initiation of female sexual activity. Thus, an increase
in age at marriage in these countries will
mean postponement of sexual activities
and first birth. (3) During the rest of this
century, a large percentage of the population will be young adults in their peak
reproductive years.

The data presented in this study give
a clear demonstration of how efforts
given to family planning programs as a
means of reducing fertility have shown a
close relationship with fertility reduction. The countries which have moderate family planning programs have reported the most rapid fertility decline.
The implication of such a conclusion as
far as the impact of religion is the focal
question, however, should be viewed
with considerable caution. It should be
emphasized that although Islam represents the common cultural tradition in
these thirty countries, these countries
encompass a variety of other cultural
settings that could induce the persistDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

ence of the present high fertility level
and absence of an attitude favoring family limitation. Among these Moslem
countries, the onset and spread of the
fertility decline seemed to cluster regionally* in a way to suggest that other
cultural factors are also responsible.

’Europe’s fertility transition has shown also
similar regional clusters along cultural groupings,
(see Van De Walle and Knodel, 1980).

In conclusion, the evidence presented in this study calls for a serious reinterpretation of the demographic transition model. That fertility transition is
now taking place in some Moslem and
other Third World Countries is now realized. The transition, however, is occurring under conditions that are different from those experienced by Western
societies.
