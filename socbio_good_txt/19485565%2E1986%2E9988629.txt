ABSTRACT: The opportunity for selection was estimated in the rural population of Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh, India. The index of total selection was found to be low. Selection in relation to birth control reveals that opportunity for selection is lower among the women
who completed their fertility by family planning methods than in women who completed their
fertility by attaining menopause. Further, the results showed that differential fertility and mortality make equal contributions to the total measure of selection in both groups.

Differences in fertility and mortality
levels in various groups in a population
are of great significance in understanding the structure of a population. In a
developing country like India, there is
the specter of mass family planning programs involving hormonal methods and
sterilization camps to control overcrowding. Since the early 1960’s, more
than fifty studies have investigated how
family planning programs may have
changed the course of fertility, either
that of acceptors or of the general population, leading to differential fertility
(Forrest and Ross, 1978).

Changing fertility and mortality patterns due to socioeconomic forces have
a profound effect on natural selection in
human populations (Cavalli-Sforza and
Bodmer, 1971). Of these forces, birth
control is the most important factor
which affects natural selection through
differential fertility. Crow (1958) suggested one possibility for measuring intensity of natural selection and derived a
total index of opportunity for selection,
which was later modified by Johnston
and Kensinger (1971). This index takes

into account fertility and mortality differences.

In the present study an attempt is
made to estimate the selection intensities and its variation due to family planning in the rural area of Visakhapatnam
District, Andhra Pradesh, India.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Demographic data were collected
during 1979 in the rural area of Visakhapatnam. Visakhapatnam is a coastal district in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
Twenty-two villages were randomly selected for the study. Reproductive histories were obtained from the women respondents of these villages through
personal interview in a house-to-house
survey. A total of 1,570 women were interviewed, and among them 1,544
women had ever been pregnant. In spite
of a thorough investigation, we were unable to get accurate information on prenatal losses because the respondents
generally could not recall all prenatal
losses and also were hesitant to give this
information due to a kind of social

stigma. When their reproductive histories were collected, women respondents
were asked to give information regarding the adoption of family planning
methods.

Data were then analyzed to compute
the fertility and mortality components
of the population. For the estimation of
selection intensities, only the reproductive histories of women who had completed their fertility were utilized. To
study the effect of family planning on selection, women with completed fertility
were divided into two groups, women
who completed their fertility naturally
by attaining menopause (hereafter,
WCFM) and women who completed
their fertility artificially by permanent
family planning methods (hereafter,
WCFFP). Of the two groups, 199
women belonged to the former and 418
women belonged to the latter group.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

below thirty years of age. The general
fertility rate of the population is 4,071
births per 1,000 women of childbearing
age. The average inbreeding coefficient
is 0.030 indicating that consanguinity is
higher in this rural population.

Table 2 shows the average number of
live births, living children, and postnatal
deaths among women of completed fertility. Mean number of live births and
living children are higher for the WCFM
than WCFFP group. Though the
WCFFP group have fewer live births,
the net reproductive index is almost
equal in both the groups, suggesting that
postnatal mortality is lower in the
WCFFP group.

ported a highest measure ranging from
0.7240 to 1.1859 (Murty and Ramesh,
1978), and it comes under the category
of lower opportunity for selection
among human populations. (Spuhler,
1976). The fertility component contributes nearly 50 per cent to the total measure of Crow’s index, indicating that the
fertility and mortality components make
equal contributions to the total index of
selection as in the Kotas of Nilgiri
(Basu, 1972) and tribal populations of
Andhra Pradesh (Murty and Ramesh,
1978).

The total selection intensity along
with fecundity, computed according to
Johnston and Kensinger (1971), is given
in Table 4. The “J” is slightly higher
than in Crow’s index, and the trend is
the same in both computations. However, here the contribution of total mortality adds more to the total measure of
selection than does the fertility compo

nent. In comparison with other populations, the index of prenatal mortality is
low in the present population. It was reported as 0.05 in a Muslim population of
West Bengal (Barua, 1976); 0.106 and
0.04, respectively, in the Colonsay and
Jura populations of the Inner Hebrides
(Sheets, 1979). The low prenatal mortality index may be due to the recall
lapses of reproductive history or unrecognizable early abortions among the rural women.

The study of selection in relation to
birth control reveals that there is a lower
opportunity for selection among the
WCFFP group than among the WCFM
group. It can be noted that higher selection intensities are associated with
higher mean live births or pregnancies
and higher mortalities. According to
Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer (1971), the
opportunity for selection through differential fertility is influenced by birth con

trol practice and modern medical care
which tend to reduce the variance in fertility. In concurrence with the above
fact, the variance in fertility is reduced
in the WCFFP group. The postnatal selection opportunity is also decreased
due to the increased fitness of the child
in small families (Rajanikumari and
Rao, 1981). This reduced variance in
fertility and mortality components may
give a low opportunity for selection in
the WCFFP group.

From these selection intensities it is
clear that among rural populations in a
developing country like India, fertility
and mortality components make essen

tially equal contributions to the potential selection. In developed countries
like the United States the mortality
component contributes only a small
fraction to the total index under the
great influence of improved health conditions. In the present study, the relative
contribution of the differential mortality
component to selection is high at the
postnatal stage. This high postnatal
mortality index may be due to environmental fators such as infectious and endemic diseases, inadequate medical facilities, and public health conditions
etc., which in turn exert their influence
on the fitness of the population.
