The Age-cause Proxy Relationship

in Infant Mortality

ABSTRACT: Data presented in this brief note show that one of the consequences of recent gains
in the control of neonatal mortality has been an increase in the frequency of endogenous
causes of death in the postneonatal period. This in turn has greatly diminished the validity of
using the postneonatal death rate as a proxy for the level of exogenous mortality in infancy.
Moreover, although there continues to be a very strong correlation between neonatal and endogenous mortality, the increasing dominance of the latter causes throughout infancy also
weakens the value of the age-cause proxy relationship during the first month of life.

It has long been common practice for
studies of mortality to distinguish between two broad classes of deaths—
those presumed to arise from genetic
make-up or internal physiological developments (endogenous), and those
whose origin is presumed to lie in external or environmental factors (exogenous) (Shryock et al., 1976, p. 232). The
rationale for this distinction lies in the
fact that the former causes are, with
their biological basis, typically less responsive to scientific progress, whereas
deaths attributed to the latter cause
group, which result mainly from infection and accident, are more easily preventable and treatable.

With respect to infant mortality, this
cause distinction has traditionally paralleled the division of deaths under one
year of age into neonatal deaths (under
one month, or 28 days) and postneonatal deaths (age 1 to 11 months). In fact,
the neonatal-postneonatal split has often been used as a proxy for the
endogenous-exogenous cause distinction (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977;
Markides and Barnes, 1977). However,

the validity of this traditional age-cause
proxy relationship has been called into
question. Bogue (1969, p. 588) has observed that endogenous causes dominate for only the first three or four days
of infancy, after which exogenous
causes are just as important as during
the last eleven months. Although Bogue’s data were not sufficiently detailed
to define a more precise age cutoff for
separating exogenous and endogenous
causes, they suggest that the neonatal
death rate as conventionally defined is
not a good proxy for endogenous mortality.

More recently, Posten and Rogers
(1985) analyzed the age/cause pattern of
infant mortality on a day-by-day basis
for deaths occurring under one year of
age in New Mexico to infants born during the years 1974-77, They found that
the endogenous and exogenous dayspecific death rates converged at about
the 78th day, and they concluded that
the use of either the neonatal or
postneonatal mortality rates as proxies
for endogenous and exogenous mortality rates is not warranted. They also sug

gested that 18 rather than 28 days might
be a better age-cause cutoff point for the
infant mortality subdivision.

It is important to note that while the
findings of Posten and Rogers disagree
with Bogue’s data in setting the length of
the neonatal period, they are compatible in suggesting that it should be shortened. Based upon our experience in examining the age-cause proxy issue,
however, we suggest that any argument
for shortening the length of time defining the neonatal mortality rate is premature. Some of the results of our recently
completed study of the socioeconomic

tracts of eight Ohio cities were aggregated into five socioeconomic status areas on the basis of the percentage of
families with a 1979 income of less than
$10,000. The census tracts were aggregated in such a way that approximately
20 per cent of the urban tracts fell into
each income area. For each of the income areas, 1979-81 infant mortality
rates (total, neonatal, and postneonatal) were calculated for all deaths and
for deaths due to the two major exogenous and endogenous categories (see

rates are presented in Table 2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Several conclusions are readily apparent from the data presented here.
First, with respect to total infant mortality, the vast majority of the deaths under
one year of age today are caused by the
endogenous conditions that are most
closely associated with the physiological
processes of gestation and births. In
metropolitan Ohio for the three-year
period 1979-81, 86 per cent of the
deaths under one year of age were attributed to one or another of the endogenous causes. Second, both the exogenous and endogenous cause-specific
death rates are inversely associated with
family income status. Not surprisingly
perhaps, the strength of the relationship, as measured by the difference between the death rates of the highest and
lowest income areas, is much greater for
the environmentally related exogenous
causes. The Area V exogenous death
rate is nearly five times greater than that
in Area I; in contrast, the Area V endogenous death rate is only one and a
half times as great as the corresponding
Area I endogenous death rate. Further,
there is an obvious tendency for the exogenous causes to account for an increasing proportion of total deaths as income status decreases, e.g., 8 per cent of
the infant deaths in Area I as compared
to 17 per cent in Area V were due to exogenous causes.

It is thus clear that despite the much
lower absolute death rate, the increased
risk of dying as economic status declines
is relatively much greater for the environmentally related exogenous causes
than it is for the endogenous causes.
However, the fact that the inverse asso
Brief Reports

ciation between infant mortality and economic status is much more pronounced
for those conditions that can generally
be regarded as most amenable to societal control must not lead one to downplay the existence of a consistent and
pronounced inverse relationship for
those less resistant endogenous conditions that account for the vast majority
of infant deaths.

With respect to the neonatal-postneonatal split, our data reveal that a
pronounced inverse association exists
between both cause groups and economic status for both the neonatal and
postneonatal period. The more interesting point in the present context, however, is perhaps the challenge these data
pose to the traditional distinction between neonatal/endogenous as opposed
to postneonatal/exogenous mortality.
With respect to this traditional practice
of using the neonatal and postneonatal
death rates as proxies for endogenous
and exogenous mortality, our data
would suggest that it is clearly no longer
justified. Although there is a pronounced predominance of endogenous
deaths in the neonatal period (93 per
cent), our data also show a heavy majority of the postneonatal deaths attributed
to these causes (73 per cent). This emerging dominance of the endogenous
causes at the postneonatal as well as
neonatal ages obviously invalidates the
traditional age-cause proxy relationship.

The increasing incidence of endogenous Causes in the postneonatal period is
likely a reflection of the progress made
in recent years in the ability to prolong
the life of high-risk births, particularly
low-birth-weight infants (McCormick,
1985). That is, many infants that a generation ago would have died within the

first few days or weeks after birth now
have a much greater chance of surviving. For some this will mean a chance to
survive infancy and grown to adulthood
leading relatively normal lives. For others it will only mean that they are able to
survive the first month only to succumb
at later ages in infancy, thus increasing
the frequency of deaths due to endogenous causes in the postneonatal period
(Miller, 1985).

Although our findings agree with Bogue’s (1969) data and the findings of
Posten and Rogers (1984) in pointing
out that the traditional age-cause proxy
relationships are no longer justified, we
have to question any suggestion pertaining to reformulating the neonatal mortality rate in terms of a period shorter
than 28 days. On the contrary, our data
suggest that any reformulation should
consider extending the length of the neonatal period!

A number of factors might explain
the differences between our findings and
those in the above cited Posten-Rogers
study. The methodology is not comparable; the time periods covered differ
(theirs is 1974-77 and is based on the
Eighth Revision of the International
List of diseases and Causes of Death,
while ours is 1979-81 and 1s based on the
Ninth Revision); and the data are for
different geographic areas (New Mexico
in the Southwest as opposed to Ohio in
the highly urbanized Northeast). Most

_ likely, however, the major reason lies in

differences in the composition of the exogenous and endogenous categories. To
cite a specific example, Posten and Rogers excluded from their analysis most
unknown and ill-defined causes, including sudden infant death (Eighth Revision Code 795; Ninth Revision Code
798). Although the exact causes of this

respiratory abnormality are still not well
understood, it is a major cause of death
today (1.e., it accounted for 8.3 per cent
of the deaths under age one in Ohio),
and we elected to include it in the endogenous group where it accounted for 9.6
per cent of the deaths attributed to this
broad cause group. That is, the exclusion of this fairly important cause in the
Posten-Rogers study may have contributed to the earlier convergence of endogenous and exogenous causes in the
New Mexico data. Since the causes of
sudden death are inadequately understood, our inclusion of it in the endogenous rather than the exogenous group
may be somewhat arbitrary. Had it been
included as an exogenous cause of
death, it might well have weakened our
argument while strengthening that of
Posten and Rogers. In any case, this is
clearly a related issue that in itself requires further investigation.

In conclusion, while our data support
research findings that challenge the validity of the traditional age/cause of
death proxy relationship in infancy, we
suggest that recommendations for enhancing the neonatal/endogenous relationship by shortening the neonatal period may be premature. Rather, this is an
issue that clearly requires further research.
