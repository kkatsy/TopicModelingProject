Differential Reproduction: Its Relation to
IQ Test Score, Education, and Occupation

Jerome H. Waller*

Dight Institute for Human Genetics
University of Minnesota
Minneapolis, Minnesota

The analysis of differential reproduction
among persons grouped on the basis of some
measure of their ability has occupied demographers in several countries for many
years. In a thorough review of the literature
prior to 1955, Anastasi (1956) traced this
kind of analysis back to the seventeenth
century in Europe and Great Britain. The
earliest observations concerned differences
in family size among social strata, for example, between rural and urban families
and between the poor and the wealthy. More
recent studies have shown an inverse relationship between family size and such variables as occupational level and amount of
education.

It had been commonly inferred from
studies of the above kinds that there existed
a similar inverse relationship between fertility and intelligence, even prior to direct
studies of this relationship. Several authors,
upon direct investigation of this question,
had expressed concern lest the continuance
of an inverse relationship should lead to a
decline in the intelligence of Western populations generally (see Cattell, 1937; Roberts,
1941; Burt, 1946). When direct tests of

this predicted decline were made by followup studies of comparable samples after an
interval of about half a generation, a small
improvement in mean score was noted
rather than a decline (Scottish Council,
1949; Burt, 1946; Emmett, 1950; and
Cattell, 1951).

It has been shown (Higgins, Reed, and
Reed, 1962; Bajema, 1963) that these predictions were based upon the faulty methodology of inferring the general intellectual
level of the population from sampling the
IQ scores of school children. Even if the
measured IQ score of a child were an unbiased estimate of the level of the family
from which he came (Thomson, 1946; GilesBernardelli, 1950), any inference made from
these scores would be applicable only to the
reproducing members of the parental generation. This difficulty was alluded to in a
paper by Duncan (1952), but it remained
for Higgins, Reed and Reed (1962) and
Bajema (1963) to study the fertility of complete samples of adults who had been tested
as children. These authors found that when
the non-reproducing members (both single
and married) of the parental generation
were included in each group studied, the
correlation between IQ score and family size
was not significantly different from zero.

Hence, there was no evidence that differentials in family size contributed to a decline
in the intellectual ability of the population
as a whole.

It appears that measures of differential
fertility by education and occupation contribute less to this argument than one might
hope. Most recent studies of differential fertility by educational attainment and occupational level have been based upon census
data and have not included nonreproducing
persons (Kiser, 1960; Mitra, 1966a, 19668).
The studies of Dice, Clark, and Gilbert
(19640, 19646) and Bajema (1966) acknowledged this shortcoming and included data
for single and childless persons. Differentials
in fertility among educational and occupa-~
tional groups have apparently been decreasing in recent years, although a slight inverse
relationship has been described by several
authors (Ruggles and Ruggles, 1940; Dice,
Clark, and Gilbert, 19645; Bajema, 1966,
1968).

The Kalamazoo study (Bajema, 1963)
introduced the intrinsic rate of natural increase (fm) into considerations of the differential fertility of IQ score groups. This
statistic takes into account not only the
differential rates of childbearing, but also
differences in mortality and generation
length. By use of this “life-table”? method
one May more accurately estimate the direction of natural selection in relation to ability
(as measured by IQ score) than is possible
using only the number of children born per
individual. When he calculated generation
length by this method, Bajema (1963) found
a very slight positive relationship between
that variable and IQ score. This could lead
to a slow deline in the measured IQ of the
population if the same relationship were true
of the whole population, and if it persisted
over many generations,

Since the heritability of measured IQ is
rather high (the best estimates range from
0.6 to 0.7), it is of interest to population
geneticists to ascertain what effect natural
selection may have had upon the complex

Differential Reproduction 123

of genes favoring high IQ score. This natural
selection estimate has been available only
for the urban sample of Bajema (1963). He
concluded that the population under study
had quite likely experienced ‘‘a very slight
increase in the frequency of the genetic factors favoring high intelligence during the
one generation that the population was
studied.”

The present study was undertaken to
ascertain whether the same forces were at
work in another, somewhat different, population. The two main goals were to establish
the presence or absence of differences in generation length among IQ score groups and
to evaluate the effect of natural selection in
relation to IQ score. At the same time, differential family size was analyzed among
educational and occupational groups and
the extent of positive assortative mating for
IQ score and educational attainment was
ascertained.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Some sixty years ago a study of the families of about 1,500 mentally retarded persons in the Minnesota State School and
Hospital was completed by staff members of
that institution. From 1947 to 1960, a reinvestigation and expansion of that study was
conducted at the Dight Institute for Human
Genetics at the University of Minnesota.
Spouses of persons married in the years after
the initial contact and children born in the
intervening years were added in that followup study, through contacts with relatives.
In addition, IQ scores, years of schooling
completed, and occupation were obtained
from school records, from the Department
of Public Institutions and Welfare, and from
contacts with the individuals (see Reed and
Reed, 1965).

In 1967, a sample of this population was
chosen for a second follow-up. This sample
consisted of families for whom an IQ score
was available for both parents and in which
the mother was born on or before December
31, 1927. In order to avoid possible bias

toward the low end of the IQ scale, relatives
of the original patients were excluded if they
were of the third degree or closer. Hence, the
persons In this study are representative of
the Minnesota population, excluding nonwhite persons.

The above cut-off date established maternal age of 40 years or more as the criterion
of completed family size. Vital statistics
data for the state of Minnesota during the
years 1962 through 1965 (when maternal
age at birth was included on the birth certificate) showed that 2.69% (8186/303,976)
of live births were to white women of ages
40-44 years and that 0.21% (589/303,976)
of the live births were to white women aged
45 years or older. If the reproductive history
of the younger females parallels that of the
population of the state, their families are
not quite complete. However, there were
only 227 couples ascertained on the more
stringent criterion (maternal age greater
than 45 years); moving the age criterion
down to age 40 enlarged the initial sample
to 529 families.

To the 529 families thus selected were
added the reproducing and nonreproducing
siblings of the spouses, if an IQ score was
available for them. If an IQ score was available for the spouse of a sibling, that individual was also included. The above criteria for
completion of fertility were used for married
females. If the wife’s age was unknown, the
husband’s age of 45 years or more was used
as the criterion of his completed fertility.
For unmarried persons, the criteria of completed fertility were age 35 for females and
age 40 for males.

An attempt was made to locate the 529
families and obtain additional information
from them. Sources of addresses used were:

1. Addresses on file at the Dight Institute
. City directories
. Telephone directories
. “Directory assistance” operators when no

telephone directory was available locally

. Death certificates
. Correspondence with relatives.

An initial letter was sent. If no answer
was received, this was followed by a second
letter. A third letter was sent via certified
mail if neither of the first two mailings had
elicited a response. Using this method, information was obtained from 423 of the 529
couples (80%); 43 (8%) were contacted but
refused to cooperate; and the addresses of
63 (12%) remained unknown.

The total sample consisted of 846 parents
and 757 siblings and spouses of siblings, a
total of 1,603 persons. Information on file at
the Dight Institute was used, where pertinent, for the nonrespondents and those with
address unknown. This enlarged the data
base for the assortative mating comparisons
and certain of the correlations.

The items of information needed for each
subject in the present study were these:

. Date of birth

. Amount of schooling completed in years

. 1Q test score, name of test used, and date
of testing

. Occupation of father of the subject at subject’s age 16 years

. Present occupation of the subject (job
title and type of industry or service)

. Items (1) through (5) for the spouse of the
subject

. Number of children in the (completed)
family

. Names and dates of birth of children

. Date and place of death if the subject’s
spouse was deceased.

\O 06 ~I ON wn A GW NO

The files at the Dight Institute contained
the information in items (1) through (3) for
most of the subjects. A questionnaire was
mailed with the above-mentioned letter to
each family. The form of this questionnaire
closely paralleled that of the OCG (Occupational Changes in a Generation) supplement to the 1962 Current Population Survey
of the United States Bureau of the Census
(see Blau and Duncan, 1967, Appendix B).
When the date of birth of the subject was
not known from the records, this additional
information was requested. For 30 of the 36
persons known to be deceased, the date of
death was known. In the six remaining cases,
this date was ascertained from the DepartDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

ment of Vital Statistics of the appropriate
state.
From the relevant items named above,
the following information was calculated:
1. Age at death or age at loss to follow-up in
completed years
2. Age at time of IQ test in completed years
3. Age at birth of each child who lived one
year or more, in completed months

4. Arithmetic mean age at birth of these children, for both mother and father

Occupation level was scored from 1 (highest) to 7 (lowest) and education level from 1
(highest) to 7 (lowest) using the scheme devised by A. B. Hollingshead (1958). Because
the value of the farm was unknown for those
reporting occupation simply as “farmer,” it
was not possible to score them within the
scale so the identifying number 9 was arbitrarily assigned to them.

The “Two-Factor Index of Social Position” (ISP) is calculated by multiplying the
occupation level by a factor weight of 7,
multiplying the education value by a weight
of 4, and summing the products. This gives
a continuum of scores from 11 (highest) to
77 (lowest)). The range of scores was divided
into five classes by Hollingshead, and is as
follows:

Class ISP Scores
Dooce ee eee ees 11-17
TT... ce eee 18-31
| 0 0 Gr 32-47
TV ooo ee eee eee eee 48-63
A 64-77

The information to be used was numerically coded and punched on Hollerith cards
for use in the computer facility at the University of Minnesota. Standard programs
on file (UMSTAT programs) were used in
the computation of r, the Pearsonian correlation coefficient, and in compilation of
tables of frequency distributions.

The intrinsic rate of natural increase (%m)
was calculated by the life table method
(Bajema, 1963) for IQ score and educational
attainment groups. The necessary iteration
was carried out on a programmable elec
 

Differential Reproduction 125

tronic calculator, the Wang 360K located in
the Dight Institute, using a program devised
by the author following the computer method of Keyfitz (1965). The sample used for
this part of the study consisted of 319 males
and 380 females, for a total of 699 persons.

RESULTS
CORRELATION ANALYSIS

The zero-order correlations among IQ
score, educational attainment rating, social
class, size of family of origin (defined as the
number of siblings plus the subject), the
number of children in the subject’s completed family, and the subject’s arithmetic
mean age at birth of his/her children (‘‘age
at mid-child”) are given in Tables 1, 2, and
3. As the legends indicate, Table 1 deals with
the data for males, Table 2 with that for
females, and Table 3 with that for the total
sample. The mean values for each variable
are given in the last column of each table.

GENERATION LENGTH ESTIMATES

Two measures of generation length were
used in this study: (1) mean age of the
parents at the birth of each child who survived to age one year (“age at mid-child”),
and (2) 7, the generation time calculated
by means of the intrinsic rate of natural increase.

The observed values of mean generation
length as given in Tables 1 and 2 are consistent with those commonly reported for
the United States white population (28-30
years). For the 319 males of the 10-year cohort used in the life-table analysis, the mean
generation length was 29.03 + 4.54 s.d.
(s.e. = 0.22); for the females of that cohort,
the mean generation length was 27.37 +
4.08 s.d. (s.e. = 0.19). This difference, statistically significant at the 0.05 level, reflected the fact that males tend to reproduce
somewhat later than females. Unfortunately, age at marriage was unknown.

The only variable that correlated highly
with age at mid-child was the size of the in

dividual’s completed family (r = +0.365 +
0.030 S,). This is a mandatory correlation,
since this analysis in effect averages both
the onset of reproduction and the spacing
of children. The earlier mean reproductive
age of individuals with fewer years of education is reflected in the small but significant
positive correlation between educational attainment and age at mid-child for males and
females together (r = -+-0.119 + 0.034 S,)
and separately (for males, r =~ +0.108 +
0.049 S,; for females, r = +-0.135 + 0.047
5,). In each case, the standard error of the
correlation coefficient is S, = (1 — r?)//N
(see McNemar, 1969, p. 155 ff.).

The generation length of six IQ score
groups (55-70, 71-85, 86-100, 101-115, 116130, and 131-145) and of the seven educational attainment groups was examined for
each of those samples. In each of these comparisons, both age at mid-child and generation length, 7, were used to estimate generation length.

That there was no significant difference
among the IQ score groups examined is
shown by Table 4, which is comprised of the
summary statistics for the ten-year cohort
of persons having completed families. The
analysis of variance performed upon these
data (Table 5) showed no significant contribution of IQ group to the variance in generation length. The correlation found between IQ score and age at mid-child (r =
+-0.065 + 0.034 S,) reflected the same lack
of association between these two variables.
The F-test for the effect of sex upon generation length is highly significant (p < 0.001),
reflecting the common observation of shorter generation length among females than Fos tas
among males.

The values of generation length (T) are
shown in Table 6, together with the intrinsic
rate of natural increase (7m), for each of the
IQ score groups studied. Figure 1 compares
the two sets of estimates graphically. In
each case J is within the 95% confidence
limits of the estimates of age at mid-child.

tween age at birth of each child and the IQ
of the parents. In fact, only the correlation
between the IQ score of the parent and age
at birth of the sixth child is significantly
different from zero at the 0.01 level. On the
other hand, there is a positive correlation
between education and age at birth of each
child in the present study. The values of the
correlation coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 0.01 level for each of
the first three births. These data are consistent with the significant positive correlation observed between educational attainment and age at mid-child reported above.

ASSORTATIVE MARRIAGE FOR IQ SCORE AND
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

The presence and degree of assortative
marriage in the present study was assessed
by calculating the Pearsonian correlation
coefficient for husband-wife pairs. The pairs
were classified as farm or nonfarm on the
basis of the husband’s occupation.

The husband-wife correlation for IQ
score among 387 nonfarm pairs was r =
+0.241 + 0.048 S,. For education, the same
calculation among 383 nonfarm pairs gave
the value r = +0.498 + 0.038 S,.

For the 23 farm pairs, quite different

values were observed. The husband-wife IQ
score correlation was r = —0,316 + 0.188
S,, and the correlation for educational attainment wasr = —0.199 + 0.2005S,. These
figures must serve only as an indication that
further research with a larger sample should
be done, since the large standard errors obviate any conclusions from these data.

There was no discernible effect of positive
assortative marriage for IQ score upon completed family size for 408 husband-wife
pairs. A one-way analysis of variance of
family size among three groups (husband’s
score greater than wife’s score, husband and
wife in the same IQ score group, husband’s
score lower than wife’s) yielded F = 0.69
(d.f. 2, 405), which is not significant at the
0.05 level.

Similar results were found when the effect
of positive assortative mating for educational attainment upon family size was examined. The one-way analysis of variance
among three groups (husband’s education
rank greater than wife’s husband and wife
having the same rank, and husband’s education rank less than wife’s) gave a very
small F value that was not significant at the
0.01 level (F = 0.031, df. 2, 408). The low
F value resulted from a very low betweengroups mean squares, which reflects the fact
that the three groups were indeed homogeneous with regard to family size.

NATURAL SELECTION AND IQ TEST SCORE

In order to assess the direction of natural
selection with regard to ability as measured
by IQ test score, the intrinsic rate of natural
increase (tm) was calculated for the 699 persons who had completed their fertility. As
shown in Table 5 above, in the present study
the highest IQ score group had the largest
rate of increase, and the lowest group had
the smallest rate of increase.

The effect of natural selection was estimated by calculating a weighted mean for
the total sample and comparing it to the
observed mean. The observed mean score
within each group was weighted by the in
Differential Reproduction

131

trinsic rate of increase for that group and by
the number of individuals in the group, according to the formula:

6
_ do (X i) (1) (1m )
Kore = “Ga?

where 2; = number in each group, fm; = intrinsic rate of increase for each group, X;=
mean IQ score of each group, NV = total
number in the sample, and r,, = intrinsic
rate of increase for the total sample.

The observed mean IQ score for the sample was 103.40 + 14.31 s.d. (s.e. = 0.53);
the weighted mean was 103.88, an increase
of 0.47%.

The relative fitness of each of the six IQ
score groups was assessed by comparing the
values of e™? (Bajema, 1963) among the
groups, and by comparing the mean number
of offspring per adult (including the nonreproducing individuals) among the groups.
The results are shown in Table 10. The
highest IQ group had the highest value of
em? (1.2241). Values for the other groups
and for the total sample are expressed as
decimal fractions of this one. The intensity
of natural selection in relation to IQ score
(I = 1 — W,/W.) is 0.183 for this sample,
where W, is the relative fitness value for the
total sample and W, is the fitness value of
the optimum phenotype. In other words, the
phenotypic load due to variability in the
phenotype “IQ test score” is 18.3%. There
is no evidence from these considerations in
this sample that natural selection is acting
to decrease the average IQ score, and it may
be effecting a very slow increase.

Within the ten-year cohort used in the
life-table analysis there were 371 couples
who had completed their families. The mean
IQ test score for these reproducing adults is
105.10 + 9.715s.d. (s.e. = 0.50), whereas the
mean score for 35 nonreproducing persons
in this cohort was only 92.74 + 17.97 s.d.
(s.e. = 3.04). Thus the mean for the cohort
was 103.40 + 14.31 s.d. (s.e. = 0.53). IQ

test scores were available for 771 children of
the reproducing adults. The mean of the
children’s scores was 109.69 + 11.39 s.d.
(s.e. = 0.41). The mean of the children’s
scores is significantly higher than the mean
of their parents at the 0.01 level (¢ = 3.38,
d.f. 741, 770). This ¢ is corrected for the observed biological correlation of r = +-0.72
between these parents and their offspring
(McNemar, 1969, p. 113, 114). A substantial
part of this difference is probably attributable to the children being tested at an earlier
age than were the parents. In his study of a
larger sample that included these parents
and children, Higgins (1961) estimated that
about five points of the difference was due
to this age effect.

ESTIMATES OF HERITABILITY

Four estimates of the heritability of the
phenotype ‘IQ test score” were calculated
from the data of the present study. The first
was an estimate of the regression of the
average scores of the offspring (mid-child)
upon the average scores of the parents (midparent). This estimate was derived by
weighting the correlations of mid-child and
mid-parent scores for 2- through 5-child
families following the procedure outlined by
Falconer (1963, p. 204). The weighted zscore of the correlations was +0.844, which
is equivalent to a correlation of r = -+-0.689
for the total sample of 258 families. The
regression of mid-child on mid-parent calculated from this weighted r was bop =

0.631 + 0.046 s.d. Since in the case of regression of mid-child on mid-parent, 6 = h?,
this gives an estimate of 0.631 + 0.046 for
the heritability (Falconer, 1960, p. 181).
The second estimate of heritability was derived from the regression of mid-child score
on the father’s score, in which case bop =
$h?. Using the above method of weighting,
bop was estimated to be 0.334, which leads
to an estimate of 4? = 0.668 + 0.025 s.d.
The third estimate was based upon the regression of mid-child score on the mother’s
score. In this case, the estimated heritability
is 0.654 + 0.025 s.d. The fourth estimate
was based upon the intra-class correlation
between full siblings in the same sample of
families. Here, r’ > $h?. The calculated value of 7’ for this sample is 0.333, which incorporates a correction for sibships of different size (see Cochran, 1939) and yields a
heritability estimate of 0.666. All of these
values are consistent with each other and
are closely comparable to values given in
the extensive literature on the subject (see
Erlenmeyer-Kimling and Jarvik, 1963).

DISCUSSION

The extensive data analyzed in the present study approach the “‘ideal”’ set forth by
Anastasi (1956) for studies of the relationship between family size and intelligence (as
measured by IQ test score). The test scores
used for both generations were obtained
prior to the vocational differentiation of the
subjects, and the subjects in the parental

generation were followed up after their families were complete. The data utilized in the
life-table calculation include the dates of
birth of all children and adults, the number
and age of deceased persons, and the nonreproducing persons. The amount of education subsequent to testing was known for
most of the adults, as was the present occupation of the head of the household. In addition, the status of the families into which
the members of the parental generation were
born was estimated from the occupational
level of their parents. These data are part of
a report now in preparation.

Examination of the correlation matrices
(Tables 1, 2, and 3) yields few surprises.
The results of the present study are closely
comparable to values reported in the literature for the relationships among IQ test
score, education, socioeconomic status, and
family size (whether family of origin or own
completed family). The necessity of including all persons in a given generation (including all single persons and childless marriages) is reiterated.

The contrasting results of using the two
methods of estimating the relationship between IQ test score and family size (that is,
excluding versus including the 0-child category) are shown most clearly in the correlations for males (Table 1). Whereas the
correlation between IQ test score and size
of family of origin is r = —0.305, as commonly reported in the literature, there is no
correlation whatever between IQ test score
and the males’ own completed family size.
For the females on the other hand, there is
no correlation between IQ score and size
of family of origin, whereas there is a significant positive correlation between IQ test
score and the females’ own completed family
size. When the effect of size of family of
origin is held constant, the first order partial
correlations between IQ test score and size
of completed family are r5.4 = +0.018 for
males and ris.4 = +0.161 for females, both
of which represent a eugenic effect of IQ
upon completed family size. The corre
Differential Reproduction

133

sponding values of the zero-order correlation
coefficients for the total sample (Table 3)
are r = —0.120 + 0.047 S, for IQ score
by the size of family of origin and r =
+0.161 + 0,033 S, for IQ score by the subjects’ own completed family size. The first
order partial correlation between IQ score
and size of completed family (holding constant the size of family of origin) is 75.4 =
+0.127. Hence, in this study there appears
to be a eugenic effect of IQ test score upon
the size of completed family for any given
size of family of origin.

The most useful data for evaluating reproductive performance are those gathered
for individuals who have completed their
fertility. Unfortunately, by the time these
data are available they may not reflect current trends. The comparison of reproductive
rates among younger cohorts is possible; for
example, curves of the number of offspring
per person-year (which could be derived
from a life table for the sample) might reveal
recent trends.

The historical trend toward smaller families was analyzed in this study by selecting
males and females from the sample used for
the life table for IQ score. The size of each
individual’s own completed family was compared with the size of his or her family of
origin (which was the completed family size
of the prior generation). For this comparison, only those persons in each generation
who had one or more children were included.

For the 202 female propositi in this sample, the mean completed family size was
3.68 + 1.69 s.d. (s.e. = 0.12); the mean
number of children in their sibships was
4,26 + 2.17 s.d. (se. = 0.15). There was
thus a decrease in mean family size of
0.58 + 0.19 s.e.x during this one-generation
interval. The correlation between the completed family size of the propositi and the
size of their sibships was r = +0.186 +
0.068 S,. The same statistics were calculated
for 155 male propositi whose wives were in
the same ten-year cohort. The mean completed family size of the male propositi was
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

134 Waller

3.78 + 1.90 s.d. (s.e.= 0.15); the mean
number of children in their sibships was
4,27 + 1.90 s.d. (s.e. = 0.19). The decrease
in mean family size was thus 0.49 + 0,15
s.e.x. There was no significant correlation
between the completed family size of the
males and the size of their sibships (r =
+0.072 + 0.080 S,).

One might infer from a comparison of the
correlations for males versus females that it
was the female who determined the size of
completed family. Since the males and females in this sample were not spouses, this
interesting hypothesis cannot be rigorously
tested with these data.

The decrease in mean family size during
this interval of one generation is statistically
significant at the 0.05 level for the families
ascertained through male propositi, and at
the 0.01 level for the families ascertained
through female propositi. The data for these
two samples show clearly a decrease in mean
family size of about 0.5 in this one generation, which is attributable to changing attitudes toward family size and to increased
use of contraceptive techniques.

The only study that has reported estimates of generation length for various IQ
groups is that of Bajema (1963) who analyzed data from a two-year cohort of persons
tested when they were in the sixth grade of
the Kalamazoo, Michigan public schools. In
that study there was a “‘very slight positive
relationship between IQ and generation
length.” Other evidence that the age of the
parent at reproduction is positively correlated with his IQ score comes from the study
of Conrad and Jones (1932), who found a
positive correlation between IQ score and
age of the parent at the birth of the first
through fourth child.

The data of the present study give no
evidence of a correlation between IQ test
score and age at mid-child as a measure of
generation length (Table 3). As Table 9
shows, there is some evidence for a positive
correlation between the IQ score and the age
of the parents at birth of their children. This

Social Biology

evidence is equivocal, however, since a negative correlation is found for the third, sixth,
and seventh children. Figure 1 shows plainly
that in the present study there is no significant difference in the mean age at mid-child
among the persons in six IQ score groups.
The value of 7 as a measure of generation
length falls within the 95% confidence limits
in each case. No variance estimates are
forthcoming from the calculation of T for
one sample. Thus, it is not possible to state
confidence limits for that estimate of generation length. Since these results are calculated from data gathered from a ten-year
cohort, it is possible that secular trends during the ten-year period might obscure differences in generation length. However, a twoway analysis of variance among IQ score,
age at mid-child, and year of birth in twoyear intervals gave no evidence of a significant interaction between year of birth and
age at mid-child (F = 1.018, d.f. 20, 736).
In the present study, there is no discernible
dysgenic effect of generation length upon intellizence as measured by IQ score.

Although there is evidence of significant
positive assortative marriage for IQ test
score and educational attainment in the
sample of this study, no effect of this assortment upon family size was detected. The
failure to detect any increase in family size
with increasing similarity of the partners on
these two measures could be due to insufficient ascertainment of childless siblings of
the subjects, to the small number of persons
in this sample, or to both of these. The percentage of childless couples was a crucial
factor in the demonstration by Garrison,
Anderson, and Reed (1968) that positive
assortative marriage for educational attainment was associated with an increase in the
number of children per woman in the United
States white population.

Assortative marriage among couples
claiming farm occupations was markedly
different from the pattern for those listing
nonfarm occupations. Although the husband-wife correlations among farm couples

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

Vol. 18, No. 2

were negative for both IQ test score and
education, the small number in the farm
category precludes the conclusion that assortment among farm couples is indeed different. The difference found, however, does
suggest that further investigation of this
question is warranted.

The prediction of an increase in the mean
IQ score of the offspring was borne out. In
fact, the offspring mean was considerably
higher than the prediction (109.60 vs.
103.88). This is presumably due in part to
the several types of tests administered to the
two generations, since the scores for neither
generation were strictly standardized or adjusted for differences in mean and standard
deviation. If we accept the Higgins (1961)
estimate that five points of the difference in
means is due to difference in age at testing
between the two generations, the mean for
the children is lowered to 104.60. The comparison of the observed mean with that predicted from the fitness considerations then
becomes more reasonable. The direction of
change remains the same.

In the sample of the present study, natural selection seems to be acting to favor the
phenotype “higher IQ score.” This same result was reported by Bajema (1963) for a
sample of adults in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
In the Michigan study the phenotypic load
due to variability in intelligence was estimated to be 13%; the corresponding figure
for the present sample is just over 18%.

SUMMARY

The correlations among IQ test score, educational attainment rating, socioeconomic
status, total number of children in the family of origin, total number of offspring in
completed families, and mean age at birth
of live-born children (“age at mid-child”)
were examined for a representative sample
of the Minnesota white population. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (7m) and generation length (7) were calculated by the
life-table method (for individuals having
completed their fertility) for IQ test score

and educational] attainment groups. The degree of assortative marriage for IQ score and
educational attainment group was evaluated
by use of the Pearsonian correlation coefiicient. Finally, the direction of natural selection for the phenotype “IQ test score”’ (consisting of both genetic and environmental
components) was determined by considering
the relative fitness of IQ score groups using
both the number of offspring per adult and
the value of e™? as indices of the reproductive performance of these groups. It seems
that natural selection is favoring an increase
in mean IQ score in the sample of the present study, or at least there is no evidence
for a decrease.

The correlation analyses corroborated
previously reported values in most instances. However, there was no evidence in
the data of the present study that differences in generation length among IQ groups
contribute to a dysgenic effect of IQ upon
relative fitness. To the contrary, lower IQ
score was associated with a slightly longer
generation length.

The data of this study showed a decline
in mean completed family size in one generation of about 0.5 persons among persons
having one or more children. This figure resulted from comparing the mean completed
family size produced by 357 propositi with
the mean size of their sibships. There was
a correlation (r = +0.186 + 0.068 S,) between size of family of origin (size of sibship) and size of own completed family
among 202 females. No correlation between
these two variables was found among 155
males.

The data of this study showed positive
marital assortment for IQ score (r =
+0.241 + 0.048 S,) and for educational attainment (r = +0.498 + 0.038 5S,).

Four estimates of the heritability of the
phenotype “IQ test score” for this sample
coincide well with each other and with the
values reported previously. The value of h?
estimated from parent-child regression is

dren’s scores on the score of the father alone,
it 1s 0.668 and on the score of the mother
alone, it is 0.654. The estimate from the
intra-class correlation of full siblings is 0.666.
