Effects of Birth Weight on Later Intelligence

Sandra Scarr

Graduate School of Education
University of Pennsyloania
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Within the range of full-term birth
weights, about 2,500 to 4,500 grams, few
investigators have found differential effects
of birth weight on later intelligence. Studies
of infants born at full-term weights seldom
show significant correlations between birth
weight and later behavioral characteristics.

There is little question, however, that
low birth weights (less than 2,500 grams),
especially those below 2,000 grams, can have
permanent deleterious effects on later intellectual performance (Wiener, 1962, 1965;
Drillien, 1958, 1961; Dann, Levine, and
New, 1964; Hardy, 1965; Singer, Westphal, and Niswander, 1968; Williams and
Scarr, in press). Incidences of gross neurological impairment and minimal brain damage are many times higher among low birth
weight infants. Poor intellectual development in later life can be traced to poor
intrauterine nourishment, anoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, metallic acidosis, poor metabolic functions, infections, and other forms
of perinatal distress often suffered by low
birth weight infants. Low birth weights
have repeatedly been shown to be associated
with later intellectual decrements, but birth
weights above 2,500 grams have not shown
differential effects.

The difficulty in studying the effects of
higher birth weights in single-born children

 

is that so many other factors that affect
intelligence are left to vary uncontrolled.
Several pre- and perinatal factors of known
influence on intelligence are genotype, intrauterine environment, gestational age,
birth weight, and perinatal care. In any
group of single-born infants, all of these
factors vary widely making the isolation of
the effects of any one factor very difficult.

CO-TWIN COMPARISONS

Twin births offer a real control for several
potent factors. Twins share identical gestational ages, similar intrauterine and postnatal environments, and identical twins
have exactly the same genotype. By using
identical twins, one can pose the question:
Given the same genotypes with identical
gestational ages, what are the effects of
differing birth weights?

Birth weight is a function of the individual genotype and the prenatal environment, including such variables as maternal
nutrition, infections, adequacy of placental
attachment, presence of complications and
many other factors. Twins share the same
uterus at the same time, but their experiences in utero are not identical (Allen, 1965;
Price, 1950). Differences in the adequacy of
nourishment of twins in utero are known to
result in differing birth weights (Churchill,

250 Scarr

1965; Babson et al., 1964; Willerman and
Churchill, 1967). The co-twins in the same
uterus are subject to grossly similar prenatal experiences, but there are enough
differences to produce different birth weight
phenotypes from the same genotypes.

Identical twins also have similar postnatal environments. They share the same
homes, same schools, and same friends as
they develop. All the postnatal environmental factors which are known to affect
developing intelligence have been shown to
be very similar for co-twins (Smith, 1965;
Scarr, 1968). Thus, later environmental factors, which are potent in the development of
intelligence, can be controlled by the use of
identical twins reared together.

Within identical twin pairs, Babson et al.
(1964), Churchill (1965), and Willerman and
Churchill (1967) have shown a positive relationship between birth weight and intelligence. The heavier twin at birth more often
has the higher tested intelligence later.
Churchill (1965) formulated an hypothesis
of intrauterine impoverishment to account
for the finding. During some pregnancies, he
reasoned, deficiencies of nutritional ingredients, circulation, gas exchange, and
waste removal interfere with brain development. One twin may suffer more than the
other in the same uterus,

Many of the twins studied by Churchill
(1965) and later by Willerman and Churchill
(1967) were not low birth weight (less than
2,500 grams). Although they did not stress
the point, the finding that lower birth
weight is associated with lower IQ held
throughout the range of birth weights in
their sample.

The crucial question is then: How high
can birth weights be and still show differential effects on later intelligence? Can infants of 3,000 grams be shown to have better
tested intelligence later than those born at
2,900 grams?

This paper presents data on the effects

trolling for gestational age and postnatal
environment. The findings replicate the
Willerman and Churchill (1967) study and
allow a more extensive interpretation of the
results.

METHOD

Sixty-one pairs of female twins between
the ages of 6 and 10 in the Boston area were
extensively blood-grouped. Of these, 26
pairs were diagnosed as identical or monozygotic twins, and 28 pairs as fraternal or
dizygotic. All but two of the identical pairs
had a diagnosis of monozygosity established
beyond the 0.95 level by blood grouping.
Two pairs were diagnosed as probably
identical by handprint analysis. One pair
had to be eliminated from this study because they had identical birth weights—
and, incidentally, identical IQ scores. The final sample consisted of 25 pairs of identical
female twins with a mean age of 95 months
and a mean performance IQ of 100.5.

The twins were representative of the
Boston metropolitan area in social class, religion, and ethnic origins. They were
drawn from a larger group of twins enrolled
in a longitudinal study conducted at the
Forsyth Dental Center. The present sample
included 20% of all monozygotic female
twin pairs of the 6-10 age group in the Boston area, estimated from the frequency of
twins in the white U.S. population (Allen,
1955; Karn, 1954). Every family contacted
agreed to be tested, so that the sample can
be considered representative of the larger
Forsyth group and of twins in the Boston
area. Additional information on the sample
has been published in several places (Scarr,
19662, b, c, 1968).

Generalization of the results of twin studies to single-born children is fairly easy if the
characteristics studied have no connection
with twinness. For example, hair color and
PTC-tasting distributions are the same in
twins and non-twins, so that results can be
safely generalized from one to the other.

Birth weights are not equal in twins and
single-borns, however. Twins are more often
born at lower birth weights, both because of
poorer intrauterine environnients and because of shorter gestations. While these
conditions are not limited to twin pregnancies, they do occur more frequently. Care
must then be exercised in generalizing twin
results on the effects of lower mean birth
weights to single-borns of higher mean birth
weights.

While it is true that many twins have
less than optimum intrauterine environments, many single-born infants are also
exposed to the hazards of inadequate
nourishment and premature birth. It seems
likely that generalizations can be made
from twins of birth weights less than 2,500
grams to similar birth weight singletons,
given the same gestational age. Twins of
more than 3,000 grams can safely be considered term pregnancies, and their results
generalized to full-term singletons of similar
birth weights.

TESTS

The Draw-a-Person Test (Goodenough,
1926; Harris, 1965) was used to assess performance IQ in an easy and reliable way.
The scoring of the Draw-a-Person Test is
proscribed in the manual (Harris, 1965).
Interscorer reliability for the present sample
was 0.93. The test correlates moderately
well (about 0.40 to 0.75) with the WISC
verbal and performance scales for the age
groups studied here and is a recognized
measure of general ability for children from
5 to 12.

Many other measures of activity (Scarr,
19662) social introversion-extroversion
(Scarr, 1965, 1969), and curiosity were completed on the same children. There was no
relationship between any of these measures
and birth weight.

Mothers’ ratings of their twins’ personalities and of their own behavior toward the
twins showed no relationship to birth

weight. In most cases the differences in cotwins’ birth weights were small (less than
300 grams), so that differences between
them were not significant for the mothers
even at the beginning. By grade-school age,
birth weight was not thought by the mothers
to be a significant source of variation between co-twins.

At the time these data were collected, no
hypotheses about the effects of birth weight
on performance had been contemplated, so
that unconscious biases were unlikely to be
present. Twins’ birth weights were requested among a large number of background variables during interviews with the
mothers. Mothers’ recall of many facts
about their children may be faulty, but they
do recall birth weight accurately (Haggard,
Brekstad, and Skard, 1960).

RESULTS

The primary data from both the Willerman and Churchill (1967) and the present
study are presented in Table 1.

The basic characteristics of the two samples were remarkably similar despite their
total independence, Birth weights of the
heavier and lighter twins differed between
thesamples by about 100 grams; mean ageat
testing differed by less than a year. For purposes of analysis it was possible to combine
the data to increase the sample sizes from
27 and 25 to a total of 52 pairs of identical
twins.

For the two samples, the birth weight of
the heavier twins was about 2,500 grams and
of the lighter twins, about 2,250. Less than
300 grams separated the heavier from lighter
groups. As a whole, the twins had lowerthan-average mean birth weights, and less
than half could be considered full-term infants (48 of 104 infants weighed more than
2,500 grams). However, three-quarters
weighed more than 2,000 grams, which has
often been thought to be the weight below
which neonatal well-being is jeopardized.

Lower birth weight was found to be asDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

sociated with lower intelligence in the two
samples, regardless of their twin status. For
the total of 104 children, the distribution of
IQ scores by birth weight is significant
(F = 3.28, p < 0.05). Children weighing less
than 2,000 grams had average IQ’s of 87
compared with average scores of 104 for
those born at more than 3,000 grams. Table
2 gives the distribution of scores for the
combined samples.

A similar table was constructed without
the 14 Negro children whose extremely low
birth weights, low IQ’s, and unknown environmental circumstances made them difficult to compare with the other children.
Among the 90 white children, IQ was probably related to birth weight within the range
represented by F = 1.90, » = 0.10. Children weighing less than 2,000 grams had
average IQ’s of 91 while those born at more
than 3,000 grams averaged 13 points higher.

As many researchers have noted, however,
this relationship between birth weight and
intelligence is highly biased by social class
variables. Both lower birth weight and
lower social class are independently related
to lower intelligence. To separate the effects
of birth weight from those of social class requires a carefully controlled study of a
special type (see Wiener, 1962, 1965).

The major controls in a twin study permit the following question: What are the
effects of higher and lower birth weights on
the same genotypes reared in the same postnatal environments? By comparing only cotwins, the social class bias in the relation
 

 

Birth Weight and Intelligence 253

ship between IQ and birth weight disappears.
In answer to the question, both samples
showed significantly larger numbers of
heavier co-twins with higher IQ’s in the
grade-school years. Being born at a higher
birth weight has lasting consequences for
later intellectual performance regardless of
social class. Table 3 shows the results in
chi-square form.

The effects of birth weight on later intelligence were not limited to infants at
birth weights below 2,500 grams, as might
be expected. When heavier and lighter cotwins were compared at birth weights above

and below 2,500 grams, the results were the
same. When both twins weighed over 2,500
grams, the heavier twin had a higher IQ
score about as often as when both weighed
under 2,500 grams. Table 4 shows the effects
of greater birth weight within identical twin
pairs above and below term weight.

The size of the difference in measured IQ
between the heavier and lighter co-twins
did not vary by the birth weight range, but
by the amount of the birth weight difference.
As shown in Table 5, when both twins were
above 2,500 grams, the mean difference in
their scores was about 5 points. When both
weighed below 2,500 grams, the mean difference was about 6 points. When only one cotwin weighed less than 2,500 grams, the difference between heavier and lighter cotwins was about 13 points.

The greater IQ discrepancy in the group

 
254 Scarr

with one twin below 2,500 grams resulted
from large differences in birth weight. Six of
the eight pairs with one co-twin under 2,500
grams had birth weight differences of more
than 500 grams. This large discrepancy may
be caused by transfusion syndrome, a condition in which one monozygotic twin bleeds
into the other through an intraplacental connection. The smaller twin suffers a very poor
intrauterine experience, resulting in later
intellectual damage.

Transfusion syndrome has been shown to
account for large IQ differences between
monozygotic twins (Babson et al., 1964) and
probably explains the greater IQ differences
in pairs with one twin above and one below
2,900 grams. Only 2 of the 44 pairs with
both members above or below 2,500 grams
showed birth weight differences of 500 grams
or more, which probably accounts for the
smaller IQ differences in these groups. It
should be noted, then, that the size of IQ

Social Biology

differences between co-twins was not affected by the absolute weight of the twins,
but by the size of the weight differences between them.

Birth order was related to birth weight in
that the heavier twin is the first born 33
times and the later born 19 times in the two
samples, as shown in Table 6. But birth
order was not associated with intelligence
within twin pairs, as shown in Table 7. The
differential effects on intelligence belonged
to birth weight and not to birth order.

DISCUSSION

' Within a jarge range of birth weights,
from 750 to perhaps 3,500 grams, one might
conclude with justice, “The bigger the
better.” With a few exceptions like the overweight infants of diabetic mothers, most
newborns will thrive in the perinatal period
if they are relatively large. Initial well-being

seems also to affect later intellectual development.

Since behavior is a function of the whole
organism in its environment, it is reasonable
to find that better nourished, more fully
developed newborns are better able to take
advantage of the environment than poorly
nourished infants and prematures. That
these initial conditions have measurable
lasting consequences is more surprising,
especially when the conditions are not
severe.

Identical twins have been used to show
the long-term effects of birth weight when

genetic and many environmental factors
have been controlled. The advantages of the
heavier twins in later intellectual performance result from better prenatal conditions
and higher birth weight, not from genetic
differences or length of gestation, which are
identical in monozygotic twin pairs.

mental ways. However, there is every reason to conclude that higher birth weights
also have beneficial consequences for one-ofa-kind genotypes within the range of birth
weights studied here. Superior and very
bright children are born at every birth
welght, except perhaps the very lowest, but
one can wonder how much brighter many
children would be if their prenatal conditions had given them a better head start.
