and Increasing Awareness of Safety

ABSTRACT: Family planning clinics and a random sample of private physicians throughout the
United States were surveyed in 1972 and 1984 to learn the incidence of performed and refused
vasectomy, and to discern attitudinal change over time toward delayed physical and
psychological sequelae related to vasectomy. Data show that, after a dramatic rise in popularity
in the early 1970’s, incidence has fallen significantly in the intervening years. The greater
decrease was reported by physicians. Clinics experience a lower refusal rate which may be
partially explained by physicians’ predilection to practice defensive medicine. Other factors,
such as counseling quality and applicant eligibility criteria, show little difference. Concern
about physical sequelae has diminished, as has the importance of psychiatric symptomatology
as a Screening tool. Delayed psychological sequelae remain more ambiguous, with physicians
deemphasizing the potential phenomena but clinical staff becoming somewhat more concerned.
Nevertheless, both groups refused roughly the same percentage of applicants for psychological

reasons.

During the early 1970’s, voluntary
sterilization became so widely accepted
by men that the technique seemed destined to rival the pill as the preeminent
fertility control measure. Based on The
Association for Voluntary Sterilization
(AVS) estimates (AVS, 1983), the number of vasectomies has averaged about a
half a million per year since the early
1970’s after reaching a high-level mark
of just over 700,000 in 1971. While it
clearly remains a popular procedure,
particularly for couples who have attained their desired family size (Markman, 1982), its popularity seems to have
waned somewhat since the early 1970’s
(UhIman, 1974).

With the growing popularity of vasectomy, calls for caution emerged in the
medical literature regarding contraindications to the procedure. Given the virtually irreversible nature of sterilization,

it is not surprising that there is a consensus regarding the necessity for counseling candidates prior to performance of
the operation. There appears to be no
consensus, however, on what constitutes counseling, what information
should be imparted, or who should be
involved in providing guidance. There
are no universally accepted guidelines
governing the counseling process
(UhIman, 1973, 1975).

It has been generally considered that
vasectomy is a safe procedure (JAMA,
1981). Several medical practitioners
have voiced concern over possible longterm negative physical effects (Roberts,
1968, 1971) as well as potential postoperative psychological sequelae (Rogers,
1965, 1967; Ziegler, 1965, 1969).

Concern over physical sequelae has
focused primarily on anecdotal observations of lymph node enlargement, pro

longed fever, arthropathy, recurrent infection, glomermbonephritis, intestinal
pulmonary fibrosis, elevated level of circulating globulins, elevated BSP retention, and biologic false-positive serologic reaction. Delayed psychological
sequelae have been more rigorously
studied through longitudinal evaluation, with data suggesting that a demasculinizing potential exists with concomitant negative changes in emotional
adjustment and sexual functioning.

Over the intervening decade, empirical studies have accumulated findings
which seem to attest to the overall safety
of vasectomy. For example, in a study of
10,950 vasectomized and nonvasectomized matched pais conducted from
1976 through 1982, only one condition,
epididymitis, was found more often in
vasectomized men. No statistical differences were noted between groups for
rates of heart attack, cancer, thrombophlebitis, or impotence (AMA,
1983). Other studies have helped build a
convincing case for both physical and
psychological safety (Alder, 1981;
Brownlee, 1983; Petitti, 1982; Smith,
1981).

To discern the extent to which health
professionals’ attitudes reflect current
knowledge, a survey was conducted in
1972 which provided a picture of eligibility criteria commonly used to screen applicants, presurgical counseling practices, and the incidence of performed
and refused vasectomy. The study was
replicated in 1984, and this paper reports data spanning twelve years which
highlight changes in popularity, counseling practice, attitude toward delayed
physical sequelae and psychiatric facets
of vasectomy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For both surveys, caregivers were included who acknowledged performing

vasectomies by voluntarily registering
with The Association for Voluntary
Sterilization (AVS). A mailed questionnaire was used to gather data from a randomly selected sample of private physicians (114) and all registered clinics (72)
in 1972, and 97 physicians and 78 clinics
in 1984. Return rates ranged from 60 per
cent to 75 per cent for both surveys, with
clinics attaining the higher rates.

Although both clinical staff and physicians were self-selected, sociodemographic data indicated that respondents
were representative of other vasectomists in the health care system. All geographic regions of the United States
were included.

Vasectomy performance has traditionally been available through both
clinic services and private physicians.
This provided a basis for comparing different service delivery modes. While
physicians reflect a private practice perspective, clinics oftentimes target a
unique clientele and reflect a multidisciplinary staff approach to service deliv
ery.

RESULTS

INCIDENCE OF PERFORMED AND
REFUSED VASECTOMY

The overall quantity of vasectomies
performed by private physicians and
family planning clinics decreased from
the 1972 to the 1984 survey. Whereas
the years 1969 through 1971 attest to
dramatic growth in the popularity of
vasectomies, later survey years (198183) illustrate a substantial reduction in
vasectomy incidence and a leveling at
the 6,000 to 7,000 per year range. This
pattern is true for both clinics and private physicians.

The reduction is consistent with recent figures in the literature and AVS’s
own monitoring of incidence through

increased in the 1984 survey for physicians while clinic refusal rates remained
essentially the same. The physician average was 6.2 per cent in 1972 and 9.7
per cent in 1984 versus clinic percentages of 2.7 per cent and 3.0 per cent respectively.

Although the number of vasectomies
performed in 1971 by each service was
similar, private physicians refused three
times as many applicants. In 1970, when
the physicians performed twice as many
vasectomies as the clinics, the physicians
refused six times as many applicants. In
1969, physicians performed four times
as many but refused six times as many
applicants as clinics did.

However, in the 1984 survey, the
number of performed vasectomies was
comparable for clinics and physicians.
Yet, in 1981, physicians refused about
four times as many applicants as family
planning clinics, and the comparable
figures for 1982 and 1983 were four and
three times those of the clinics.

Data from the surveys indicate that
an applicant may have been more successful in obtaining a vasectomy through
a clinic service.

When reasons for refusal to perform
the procedure were assessed, little difference was noted between the two

groups. Eligibility-related responses
(e.g., age, parity, marital status, and
nonconsent of spouse) represented the
primary categories for refusal. Reasons
which would normally emerge during
counseling (e.g., psychological prob
lems, immaturity, coercion by spouse)
comprised a second important group.
Compared to 1972 data, both groups
in 1984 tended to place slightly less emphasis on age, marital status, and psychological problems, but slightly more

emphasis on a man’s ambivalence and
lack of potential medical or health problems, while physicians reported more id1osyncratic reasons for refusal.

DELAYED VASECTOMY SEQUELAE

Respondents were asked their opinions about a potential link between vasectomy and physical sequelae. Table 3
illustrates that neither physicians nor
clinical staff seemed to consider that
there was a high likelihood of such a
linkage. The per cent change between
surveys indicated that more practitioners considered the procedure to be free
from adverse reactions.

In considering the potential for psychological sequelae, only 8 per cent of
physicians and 18 per cent of clinical
staff believed that psychological sequelae should be a major concern. The
great majority of physicians stated that
sequelae were exaggerated, while only
about half of the clinical staff expressed
this opinion. However, while the percentage of physicians increased since
1972, comparable clinic data decreased.

In general, findings indicated that
physicians clearly viewed vasectomy as
unrelated to physical sequelae and considered psychological sequelae to be exaggerated. Clinical staff agreed with
physicians, although not as strongly,
and were somewhat more likely to consider the potential importance of untoward reactions.

Respondents were asked about specific aspects of psychiatric determinants
and influences upon their decision to
perform vasectomy. As noted in Table
4, a sizable percentage of both physicians and clinical staff regarded observable psychosis as legal cause to reject an
applicant. Nearly half of both groups acknowledged neurosis as legal grounds
for vasectomy refusal, and percentages

increased from 1972 to 1984. Perceived
legal liability—-whether real or
imagined—appeared to be a major factor in vasectomy screening.

Fewer of the respondents placed
significance on a past history of emotional instability, and its importance has
decreased as an eligibility criterion.
Among respondents who routinely allow time for counseling prior to surgery,
assessing emotional stability was a
higher ranked factor by more clinics
than private physicians.

In general, just over half of clinical
staff and about 40 per cent of physicians
acknowledged that a psychiatric diagnosis gave a clear contraindication for performing a vasectomy. Roughly a third of
both groups felt unsure about diagnosis
as a contraindication; when considered,
psychosis was the obvious psychiatric
criterion. Among reasons for refusing to
perform vasectomy, neither physicians
nor clinical staff considered psychological problems to be a basis for refusal to
any great extent (about 20 per cent of all
refusals).

COUNSELING THE VASECTOMY
APPLICANT

While the majority of the private
physicians provided counseling themselves, clinical counseling roles have
clearly changed. In 1972, three-quarters
of the clinics relied upon physicians to
provide counseling. By 1984, this figure
had decreased to about one-third, with
the utilization of nurses and vasectomy
counselors rising significantly (6 per cent
to 30 per cent for nurses and 28 per cent
to 50 per cent for counselors).

The extent to which a spouse participated in counseling also changed significantly between surveys. In both years,
physicians were more likely than clinics
to insist on the spouse’s involvement: 81

Clinics allocated more time to presurgical counseling than did private physiclans, as indicated in Table 5. More than

about the desirability of the surgery,
reason for seeking the vasectomy, and
imparting of information about the surgical procedure. Clinics were most likely
to emphasize reason appraisal, while
private physicians emphasized mutual
decision as being paramount.

However, by 1984, while physicians
continued to stress the same three components, family planning clinics significantly deemphasized mutual decision
as a counseling priority.

In both survey years, about half of
the clinics ranked assessment of the applicant’s marital status and emotional
stability among the three most important areas of vasectomy counseling.
However, there was a sharp decline
from 1972 to 1984 in the percentage of
physicians who emphasized these factors. In 1984, both groups placed a
greater emphasis on an applicant’s med
ical history, and neither sexual compatibility nor religious conflicts assumed
much importance.

Both physicians and clinical staff designated five counseling areas as imperative for discussion during counseling sessions:

1. The need for continued contraception
following the vasectomy until sperm
count shows the ejaculate to be sperm
free.

2. The permanency of the surgical procedure.

3. Immediate physical side effects which
may occur.

4. Details about the nature of the operative procedure.

5. The difficulties involved in reanastomosis of the vas, i.e., in reversing the
procedure.

both groups on factors such as physical
side effects, operative procedures, and

difficulties of reversing the procedure
may, in part, explain the increased
counseling time reported by respondents.

DISCUSSION

During the years 1969 through 1971,
survey respondents had performed
more than 68,000 vasectomies and
refused 3,500 applicants. Over the period, private practitioners doubled the
number of vasectomies performed, but
clinics increased their number of procedures eight times. The number of physicians performing vasectomies rose only
slightly, but the number of clinics acknowledging vasectomy performance
doubled. The reported growth in elective vasectomy procedures highlights
the escalated demand during the early
1970's.

Survey data illustrated a much different pattern for the early 1980’s. Respondents reported roughly 40,000 performed vasectomies—a 42 per cent
decrease from earlier data. In contrast
to earlier growth from year to year, the
number performed essentially stabilized, with physicians noting a slight decrease in procedures. Decreases in the
survey data tended to confirm an apparent national trend.

Private physicians in both surveys reported more applicant refusals than clinics. Primary reasons given for refusal
tended to cluster around either eligibility criteria or counseling assessment.

On the whole, survey data tended to
indicate that there was essentially no difference between physician and clinic
staff eligibility criteria used in screening,
very little variation in counseling practices, and virtually no difference in
stated reasons for refusal of applicants.
Yet, private physicians consistently re
Social Biology

ported more applicant refusal than clinics in both surveys. Applicant refusal appeared to be more often a decision of
the private practitioner and may be the
result of a continuing practice of defensive medicine.

The importance of delayed physical
sequelae has decreased over the years.
Physicians were much more confident
that vasectomy is unrelated to delayed
sequelae, while clinical staff were more
cautious in their judgment. Nevertheless, a greater percentage of both groups
stressed discussion of physical sequelae
in presurgical counseling with an applicant.

The pattern for delayed psychological sequelae was quite different for the
two groups. While physicians moved toward attaching less importance to psychological sequelae, clinical staff gave
greater importance to potential untoward reactions.

In keeping with differing perceptions
of possible delayed psychological sequelae, clinical staff were more apt than
private physicians to view observable
mental dysfunction as a legal basis for
vasectomy contraindication; to rank
emotional stability as an important applicant assessment factor; to include
postoperative psychological sequelae in
presurgical counseling; and, to consider
specific psychiatric diagnostic categories
as contraindicative to elective vasectomy.

It is notable that between 1972 and
1984 differences between physicians and
clinics have narrowed considerably. The
relatively low reported incidence of applicant refusal due to psychological
problems underscored the positive outcome despite uncertain attitudes and
concern over delayed sequelae.

Questions raised in the medical liter- !
ature about delayed sequelae seem to

have been largely put to rest. Differences in practices and attitude may have
been related more to staff composition
than other factors. Data indicated that
clinical staff spend more time than physicians in counseling and are more comprehensive and thorough in applicant
assessment. If clinical counseling staff
(social workers, nurses, psychologists,
trained vasectomy counselors) have
paid more attention to delayed sequelae
and psychiatric symptoms, can it be assumed that applicant refusals at family
planning clinics have been more appro

priate (i.e., men were excluded who
would have been more vulnerable to delayed psychological sequelae)? This
would be an intriguing question to address in future research.

Recent medical and psychological literature provide very little evidence of
delayed sequelae among vasectomized
men or their spouses. Indeed, few untoward reactions are reported at all. It
seems paradoxical that practitioners, especially mental health professionals,
continue to seek a psychiatric bogeyman.
