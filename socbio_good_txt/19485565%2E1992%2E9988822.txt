ABSTRACT: Using 1979-87 Hawaii vital record data on single live births, this study compares by
nativity status of the mother the maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of resident
Filipino women. Among ethnic minorities in the United States, the pregnancy outcomes of
U.S.-born mothers have been reported to compare unfavorably to their foreign-born counterparts. In this study, unequivocally preferential pregnancy outcome indicators were not observed
for foreign-born women. Contrary to expectations, a significant, but modest, increase in the risk
of preterm delivery was found for infants of Philippines-born mothers, along with a less favorable
mean birth weight and gestational age. As a growing minority population in the United States,
the atypical determinants and patterns of pregnancy outcome in this population warrants further

investigation.

Investigations of factors related to
pregnancy outcome have infrequently
considered the role of maternal nativity status. Nevertheless, rates of low
birth weight, intrauterine growth, and
infant mortality have been observed to
vary between foreign-born and nativeborn mothers of the same ethnic
group. In the United States, the pregnancy outcomes of black and Hispanic
U.S.-born mothers have been reported to compare unfavorably to their
foreign-born counterparts (Cabral,
1990; Kleinman, 1991; Valanis, 1979a,
1979b; Ventura, 1985; Williams, 1986)
and the better pregnancy outcomes of
foreign-born compared to U.S.-born
minority populations in the United
States have been cited as an indication
that considerable further reduction in
ethnic disparities in pregnancy outcomes is possible (Kleinman, 1991).

Among Asian ethnic groups in the
United States, the extent to which disparities in pregnancy outcomes exist
among women of native versus foreign
nativity has yet to be fully explored. In
the State of Hawaii, births to Filipino
mothers comprised approximately 16.5
per cent of the total single live births to
resident mothers during the period
1979 to 1987. Among the prominent
ethnic groups in this multi-ethnic environment, infants of Filipino mothers
demonstrated one of the highest percentages of low birth weight (8.8
per cent). The factors underlying this
differential in birth weight have not
been completely identified, and a paucity of information is available regarding the maternal sociodemographic
and prenatal care utilization characteristics of U.S.-born Filipinos. Further,
little is known regarding the potential

differences in pregnancy outcome experiences of U.S. resident Filipino
women who were born in Hawaii compared to those who were born in the
Philippines. Using 1979-87 Hawaii vital record data on single live births, this
study compares the maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of
U.S. resident Filipino births by nativity

effects of maternal factors on low birth
weight and preterm delivery.

Small for gestational age was determined using the birth weight for gestational age standards proposed by
Brenner (1976). Gestational age in
completed weeks was calculated as the
interval between the date of last normal menses and the date of birth. Adequacy of prenatal care utilization was
based on the Institute of Medicine’s
Adequacy of Prenatal Care Index
(Kessner, 1973).

RESULTS

Maternal sociodemographic and
prenatal care utilization characteristics
are displayed by nativity status of
mother in Table 1. Significant differences were observed for every maternal factor examined with the exceptions of a first trimester entry into
prenatal care and a birth interval of less
than one year. Hawaii-born mothers
were appreciably more likely to be less

%Educational attainment: Low educational attainment is defined as less than 12 yrs. education for adults and 2 years below
expected grade level for age for adolescents ( < 18 years). High educational attainment is defined as greater than 12 years education
for adults and 2 years above expected grade level for adolescents. Average educational attainment is 12 years education for adults and
within 1 year of the expected grade level for adolescents.

than 18 years of age and single and less
likely to be 35 years of age or older.
High educational attainment, defined
as more than a high school education
for adults and two years above grade
level for adolescents, was found for
more than one-half of the Philippinesborn mothers. Philippines-born mothers demonstrated higher percentages
of both low and high educational attainment, indicating a greater variation
in educational levels than Hawaii-born
mothers.

Table 2 presents pregnancy outcome indicators by nativity status. No
significant differences in preterm, low
birth weight, and small for gestational
age percentages were observed between the two nativity status groups.
The mean birth weight and gestational
age of infants of Philippines-born
mothers were significantly lower than
those of Hawaii-born mothers. However, the actual difference in these
measures between the two groups was
modest. The infant and neonatal mor

tality rates of infants of Philippinesborn mothers were lower than those
of Hawaii-born mothers, but the
between-group difference in these indicators was not significant.

Birth weight distributions and birthweight-specific neonatal mortality
rates are displayed for each nativity
group in Figure 1. The birth weight
distributions of the two groups were
nearly identical with only a slight shift
toward higher values notable for the
Hawaii-born distribution. Modestly
improved birth-weight-specific neonatal mortality rates were apparent for
the Philippines-born group in the 2,500
to 3,500 gram range.

The results of the logistic regression
analyses of maternal characteristics on
low birth weight and preterm delivery
are provided in Table 3. Elevated risks
of low birth weight were found for
single marital status, primiparity at all
ages, parity 1-4 for women 30 years or
greater, and low educational attainment. No difference in low birth

weight risk was found for nativity status. Adequate prenatal care reduced
the risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery. However, after taking
into account the maternal factors under study, a higher risk of preterm
birth was found for the infants of
Philippines-born mothers. Births to
unmarried mothers, to mothers less
than 18 years of age, and to primiparas
30 years of age or more also demonstrated higher risks of preterm birth.

reported more favorable outcomes
among foreign-born women (Cabral,
1990; Kleinman, 1991; Valanis, 1979a,
1979b; Ventura, 1985; Williams,
1986). Several interpretations for these
findings have been offered. Underreporting of mortality due to departure
from the United States prior to an infant’s death'has been suggested as a
potential explanation for lower postneonatal mortality rates of infants
of foreign-born mothers (Kleinman,
1991). Variations in socioeconomic
status and positive health behaviors
have also been proposed as factors that
underlie foreign nativity status advantages in pregnancy outcome (Valanis,
1979a). It has further been suggested

 
Vol. 39, No. 3-4

that individuals who elect to immigrate
may be physically and emotionally
healthier, although this potential benefit may be offset by the trauma of relocation into a new environment and
culture with a distinctive health care
system (Kleinman, 1979). Finally, socioeconomic deprivation, inadequate social support networks, and cultural isoJation in subsequent generations may
inhibit the maintenance of pregnancy
outcome levels found among new immigrants.

In this study of births to Filipino

2 approaches to these results emerge.

First, why were the pregnancy outcomes of Hawaii-born mothers not
worse, particularly given the greater
proportion of high risk maternal characteristics observed in this group? Alternatively, why were the pregnancy
outcomes of Philippines-born mothers
not better?

Investigations of pregnancy outcome in the Philippines have reported
mean birth weight and gestational age
values of approximately 3,010 grams

and 39.0 weeks, respectively (Adair,
1988, 1989; Barnes, 1991). The mean
gestational age of Filipino births in
Hawaii is in keeping with those findings from the Philippines. However,
these data suggest that Filipino infants
born in Hawaii, as compared to the
Philippines, are on the average over
100 grams heavier. While higher
levels of teenaged and single marital
status pregnancies are notable among
Hawaii-born mothers, these risk factors may, in part, be offset by the
availability of well-established community support mechanisms, prenatal
and postnatal care services, and nutritional-related education and practices.

Among Philippines-born mothers, a
notable proportion {approximately 22
per cent) indicated a father associated
with the military. It is unclear whether
the proposed healthier status of selfselected immigrants also applies to
U.S.-military-related immigrants. As-_
sociation with the military does provide access to a health care system.
However, social support networks may
be more difficult to establish and maintain due the frequency of relocation.
The large proportion (31 per cent) of
births to single mothers in the Hawaiiborn group, where information was not
available on the father, precluded further analysis of this factor.

The environment and multi-ethnic
population of Hawaii is unique and Filipinos are but one of many ethnic
groups in a population that lacks a
clearly predominant ethnic majority.
The vast majority of Filipino immigrations to Hawaii during the last quarter
century were facilitated by the family
unification provisions of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965
(East-West Center, 1985; Nordyke,

1985). These factors may have fostered
greater integration into a mixed-ethnic
culture, reduced cultural isolation, allowed for the maintenance of social
support networks, and thereby enhanced their ongoing ability to utilize
available preventive health care resources.

The distinctive aspects of this population in this setting limit the generalizability of analyses of data but offer
an uncommon opportunity to explore
exceptions to prevailing theory and to
uncover mitigating factors that can be
used to focus more detailed investigations and to develop policies aimed at
reducing disparities in pregnancy out

comes among minority populations in
the United States. Among live births to
women of Asian ethnicity in the
United States, Filipinos represent the
largest single group (Kleinman, 1990).
In spite of apparent contrasts in birth
weight, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth indicators, infant mortality rates of infants to U.S. resident
Filipino mothers have recently been reported to be lower than those of U.S.
resident whites (Kleinman, 1990). Asa
growing minority population in the
United States, the atypical determinants and patterns of pregnancy outcome in this population warrant further investigation.
