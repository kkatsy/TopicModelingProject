Psychological Aspects of
Vasectomy in Malaysia

Postoperative questionnaire inquiries into
psychological after-effects of vasectomy
have shown consistent low proportions of
men reporting deleterious effects in Western
countries, over a period now spanning forty
years (Popenoe, 1929; Alderman, 1965;
Simon Population Trust, 1969). On the
other hand, similarly conducted surveys of
Indian populations have revealed very much
higher proportions (Dandekar, 1963; Kakar, 1969; Batliwalla, 1967).

This large variation may be related to the
fact that in the West vasectomy is usually
freely chosen by men on their own initiative
to serve their private purposes, while in
Asia it is being solicited by governments
with national rather than individual interests at heart.

However, recent research has aroused
skepticism of the highly favorable reports
of psychological adjustment recorded in
postoperative questionnaires and interviews
in the West too. Successful psychological
adjustment to vasectomy requires of the
vasectomized man a reduction in the anxiety
aroused by associated unconscious fears of

Medicine, London, England, at the time this
study was done.

castration, genital mutilation, and loss of
masculinity. Defense mechanisms such as
dissonance reduction, overcompensation,
and selective perception are brought into
play in the effort to reduce anxiety over the
outcome of an unalterable decision, leading
to demonstrable discrepancies between overt
claimed satisfaction with the operation and
neurotic postoperative behavior (Ziegler,
Rodgers, and Kriegsman, 1966).

The implication of this research is that
the questionnaire form (or superficial interview) is too simple a procedure for the valid
investigation of the complex pattern of response triggered by vasectomy.

Accordingly, in 1969, a study employing
a refinement of the usual questionnaire
survey technique was undertaken by one of
us (Wolfers, 1970). In this study, no questions relating to psychological or sexual adjustment were asked on the questionnaire
form which was circulated to a subsample
of the same British population investigated
by the Simon Population Trust Survey
(1969) by the conventional postal questionnaire survey technique. Instead, respondents were asked to request an appointment
with a visiting psychologist if they believed
that they had encountered any marital or
sexual problems as a result of their opera

316

tion. By this variation in technique, the
percentage of men who signalled psychosexual complications increased from 1.5%
to 12%.

Prevailing conditions did not permit a
repetition of this procedure in Malaysia.
Instead, care was taken not to draw attention to our interest in psychosexual effects.
We did not specify whether medical or psychological effects were implied by “fears,”
“regrets,” or “ill-effects.” Nonrestricted
replies to these questions were solicited and
categorized afterwards. Only one direct
question on psychosexual effects was asked
and positive replies to this question were
followed-up with a depth interview.

The procedure lacks the motivational
involvement of the respondent of the United
Kingdom study, but emulates it in keeping
the questions open-ended and reducing
“leading” to a minimum.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

In this study, a sample of 246 men living
on three rubber estates on the outskirts of
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was interviewed
one to four years after undergoing contraceptive vasectomy operations. The men are

officer, and of the 246 men 186 reported
having first heard of vasectomy from a
visiting health officer, 27 from the mass
media, and 33 from other sources.

The aim of the investigation was to examine the incidence and nature of psychological and medical complications reported
after the operation. This report deals only
with the psychological effects; the medical
aspects will be published separately. Four
psychological variables were investigated;
regret at having had the operation, fears
arising out of the operation, loss of libido,
and marital problems attributed by the
patient to the operation. The interviews
consisted of an individually administered
verbal questionnaire form of 27 questions.
These were carried out by University students of Indian origin in the native dialect
of the interviewee. Respondents who reported psychosexual problems arising out of
the operation were reinterviewed in depth
by the Indian coauthor Dr. Subbiah a
month after the initial interview.

fears, and loss of libido were examined in
relation to a number of demographic, social,
and other variables (Table 3).

Vasectomy in Malaysia

The proportion of men expressing regrets
and fears decreases with increased age,
parity, and pregnancies of their wives.
Parity correlates positively with number of
pregnancies and age, but age is probably
the overriding variable here. The dividing
point for the significant drop in those expressing regrets by parity lies between 5
and 6 children, as indicated by the tripartite analysis.

Only “parity” (with the related variable
“number of pregnancies”) and ‘“‘whose decision to have the operation” showed statistically significant differences in the propor

tion expressing regrets, while the latter was
also the only variable to show a significant
difference in the proportion expressing fears
(p <0.05). The division hinged not on
whether the husband or the wife made the
decision, but on whether or not it was a
joint decision. The proportions expressing
regrets, fears, and loss of libido are all
higher for fathers who have suffered some
deaths among their children, and among
those reporting no abortions by their wives,
and neither age nor parity correlated with
child deaths or miscarriages.

Anxiety associated with the operation is
implied by either regrets or fears. Only nine
of the forty men who indicated that they
had some regret or fear in the interview
answered positively to both these questions,
and the nature of the answers given showed
that the respondents had made the correct
distinction between them. Table 4 lists the
combined frequencies of fears and/or regrets by various characteristics. Again,
parity is significant. Four couples in the
entire study had no living daughter, and of
these three expressed either fears or regrets.
Not a single couple without at least one
living son was present in the sample studied,
tending to indicate that men without heirs
will not apply for vasectomy in Malaysia.

Naturally enough, anxiety is also significantly associated with the presence of
physical ill-effects (real or imagined). The
responsibility for the decision to have the
operation, significant at the 5% level for
both regrets and fears analyzed separately,
becomes significant at the 1% level when
analyzed jointly. The responsibility for
decision to have the operation appears to
be independent of parity. Of the 125 men
who reported that their decision was made
jointly by husband and wife, 101 (80.8%)
have five or more living children, while of
the 104 men who reported that the decision
was made either by husband or by wife
alone, 79 (75.9%) have five or more living
children.

DISCUSSION

LOSS OF LIBIDO
Table 5 summarizes results from a variety
of Indian and European studies. This range
of incidence of loss of libido makes it difficult to believe that the results we are obtaining bear much relation to the quality
being measured. More likely the method of
inquiry and cultural differences are responsible for the wide variation in response. For

detailed discussion of this question, see
Wolfers and Wolfers, (1973).

WEAKNESS

Approximately 17% of the men complained of general body weakness in this
study. The depth interviews revealed a
possible connection between this complaint
and fantasies of absorption of sperm by the
body, as described in a later section.

The experience of weakness recurs in
most published Indian studies, but not in
European and American studies. The Family Planning Association of India (1970)
report on vasectomy in Bombay concluded,
“the data seem to suggest that either the
fact of having undergone this operation or
the specific knowledge that this operation
means cessation of fertility, is associated
with the feeling of weakness or loss of
strength” (p. 49). Some 40% said their
health had deteriorated and 23% reported
body weakness.

The report of body weakness also appears
in other contraceptive studies in developing
countries. In the Singapore I.U.D. program
“weakness” is the reason given by 5% of
women requesting removal of the device
(D. Wolfers, 1970). Further research is

needed to clarify to what extent the acceptors of contraception in developing countries, who are often anemic and suffering
from malnutrition, do actually suffer a deterioration in physical wellbeing from specific causes connected with the contraceptive procedure and to what extent this
experience is psychological in nature.

REASONS FOR HAVING THE OPERATION

The reasons most commonly given for
having the operation in this as in most
Asian studies are “enough children” and “to
avoid having more children” respectively,
while in most Western studies it is given as
“economic.” There is evidence from other
inquiries that in terms of income people
struggling to bring up children with hopelessly inadequate material means are not
primarily concerned with the added financial burden which more children present. It
would seem that five undernourished children present much the same problem as ten.
Analyzing reasons for acceptance (of the
1.U.D. in Singapore) by parity, D. Wolfers
(1970) found that “finance” as a reason
increases with parity to five children
amongst Chinese and Indians and to four
amongst Malays and then declines without
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

320 Wolfers, Subbiah, and bin Mazurka

interruption for all three ethnic groups as
parity increases. On the other hand, “too
many children” as a reason increases steadily with parity in all groups.

For purposes of motivating people to
accept vasectomy, it may be important to
differentiate these two reasons. Below some
level of prosperity, economic considerations
appear not to be the dominant ones in determining the point at which a family is
considered large enough. Knowledge is lacking as regards the more precise factors involved in the concept, of “too many children” or “enough children.” What are the
salient factors to those responding in these
terms? It does not, for instance, appear to
refer to the effect on wife’s health of repeated childbearing, for again, from D.
Wolfers’ (1970) figures, “health” as a
reason for acceptance accounts for only 3%
to 4% of reasons given at the high parity
levels (7-+-). One may speculate that after
prolonged experience of the ties of infant
care it represents a desire for personal freedom. If so, we should perhaps direct our
efforts to motivating people in developing
countries towards this desire at an earlier
stage in childbearing. Whatever the real
meaning of “too many children,” it obviously represents a too-long-delayed awakening.

SONS AND DAUGHTERS

It is well known that in most developing
countries sons are still considered (and
often still are) economic assets providing
among other things security in old age and
the fulfilling of social and religious obligations in nonnuclear-family societies. Kakar
(1969) notes in a study of 100 vasectomized men that 94 had at least two living
sons and only one had no sons. In the
present study not one of a sample of 246
vasectomized men had no sons and 234
(95.1%) had at least 2 living sons. In all,
there were exactly 1,000 sons and daughters,

 

Social Biology

117 males per 100 females. In the vasectomy
study by Dandekar in India, (1963) this
ratio was as high as 140 sons to 100 daughters.

Nonetheless, complete absence of daughters in the family appears to be a strong
contraindication for vasectomy since three
out of the four daughterless fathers in this
study expressed fears or regrets after the
operation (see Table 4).

DEATHS AND MISCARRIAGES

There is a suggestion that parents who
have lost children may need specialized
counseling, as higher proportions of those
who had experienced this misfortune reported anxiety than those who had not.
Neither age nor parity was significantly
associated with the loss of children or miscarriages.

WHOSE DECISION TO HAVE THE OPERATION

Of the present sample, 125 men (51%)
said the decision to have the operation was
made jointly by husband and wife; 112
(46%) stated the decision to have been
made separately either by husband or wife;
9 men (3%) gave other answers.

As far as we know, the only time a similar
question has been asked in a developing
country study was by Kakar (1969) who
gives the proportion who obtained wife’s
consent (67%) before undergoing the
operation. Unfortunately, no analysis was
made by other variables except for marital
harmony; 75% of those reporting decrease
in marital harmony had not sought wife’s
consent.

In this study, this was the strongest
predictor of postoperative anxiety. It would
appear that this is a rare instance where
bringing a question seemingly more relevant to an alien culture has resulted in a
productive discovery, for this variable is the
most powerful predictor of anxiety to
emerge from this study and the question is
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 20, No. 3

obviously relevant in less sexually liberal
cultures.

This question has of course been asked
in most European and American studies.
Ferber, Tietze, and Lewit (1967) report:
“Our clinical impressions were that the
strongest contra-indication for vasectomy
is disagreement with one’s wife over its advisability.” Our findings support this view
in an ethnically, religiously, socially, and
economically widely distant population.

SEXUAL PROBLEMS AND FANTASIES ASSOCIATED
WITH THE OPERATION

Nine men answered “‘yes” to the question
“Have you had any problem in your married life as a result of this operation?”
These nine and eleven others whose answers
to the questions relating to regrets and fears
implied psychosexual complaints were followed up in depth interviews.

Five of these twenty men reported decreased libido which they attributed to the
operation. Two reported an increase in
libido, which in one case gave rise to the
belief that increased frequency in sexual
intercourse was causing general body weakness and in the other to a fear that he
“would go after other women.”

Four men stated that they had sought
the operation to cure premature ejaculation; none was successful in this aim.

Four others reported that they now suffered from premature ejaculation as a result
of the operation. Two reported taking yoghurt to counter this problem.

One man complained of irritability since
the operation, and another who suffers from
T.B. stated that he had sought the operation in order to reduce his sexual desire in
the belief that that would lead to an improvement in general health.

Vasectomy in Malaysia

321

The remaining three men were selected
from the forty-two who complained of general body weakness (see Table 2). These
three had referred in the initial interview to
the prevalence of rumors about future
effects from the operation. The depth interviews revealed fantasies of weakness, fatness, and flabbiness resulting from absorption of sperm by the body and of decrease
in sexual pleasure in years to come due to
their infertility. It is of interest that the
fantasies of weakness, fatness, and flabbiness attributed by the subjects to the absorption of sperm constitute the “real”
physical syndrome of castration, though not
of vasectomy.

CONCLUSIONS

It is to be expected that vasectomy programs will continue to yield a proportion of
men reporting psychosexual problems associated with the procedure. On the evidence
of this study and its predecessor, under
conditions where answers are not restricted
and “leading” is kept to a minimum, this
proportion appears to be about 12%. The
specific forms of anxieties, and the myths,
rumors, and remedies associated with them
vary between cultures.

The specific conclusions from this study
are that more detailed preoperative counseling is required in Malaysia for future
vasectomy candidates who have less than
four or five children or have children of
only one sex, and generally more explicit
explanation of the fate of the sperm should
be elaborated for all candidates in lectures
and pamphlets.
