Fertility after Insertion of an TUCD in
Taiwan’s Family-planning Program

This is a report on the post-insertion fertility of the more than 200,000 women who
obtained an intrauterine device (IUCD) in
Taiwan’s family-planning program by July
1, 1966. (For a description of the program
and the number of insertions over time, see
Freedman and Takeshita, 1969.) It goes
beyond previous reports in (a) giving fertility experience in successive time periods
after insertion, (6) providing new guidepost
measures of fertility outside the program,
and (c) presenting some social and demographic correlates of post-insertion fertility.

The data are from the second Taiwan
follow-up survey interviews at the end of
1966 with a probability sample of 4,648 of
the 206,315 women who had an IUCD insertion by July 1, 1966. A life-table technique is used to merge post-insertion histories of various lengths to estimate the
proportions having a birth at successive
periods after insertion. Data are presented
separately for all acceptors and for the women who had terminated use of the IUCD
by the time of the interview.

Terminating use of the IUCD does not
necessarily mean stopping the practice of
birth control. As previously reported (Freed

man and Takeshita, 1969), 30 months or
more after their [UCD insertion, 48% of the
terminators had been sterilized or were using other methods of contraception; 12%,
pregnant at least once after termination,
aborted all their pregnancies; 26% never
pregnant since first insertion presumably
included many who would avoid further
births. A large proportion of all the acceptors, thus could be said to be effectively
practicing birth control 30 months after insertion, whether or not the original device
was still in place. It is not surprising then
that the post-insertion fertility of the acceptors is low.

FERTILITY IN SUCCESSIVE TIME
PERIODS AFTER INSERTION

On the basis of life-table estimates (Table
1), the proportion of acceptors with a live
birth rose in successive periods after insertion from S% at 18 months to 10% at 24
months and 15% at 33 months. If we consider only the IUCD acceptors who discontinued using the device, hereafter referred
to as “terminators,” the proportion with a
live birth rises from 11% at 18 months to
29% at 33 months. The higher rates for the
terminators are expected of course, since
they are less likely to be protected and a

disproportionate number of them were using
the IUCD to postpone another child rather
than to stop family growth. Still, as we shall
presently see, the post-insertion fertility of
either the terminators or all the acceptors is
low in relation to their demonstrated fecundity potential.

The principal aim of the Taiwan program
has been to help couples who want no more
children. About 85% of the couples who
have an IUCD inserted say they are doing
so to stop family growth; they have all the
children they want or more. One secondary
aim has been to help couples who want to
space their children so births do not come so
quickly. It should not be surprising that
couples who do not yet have all the children
they want will go on to have additional children. It is a little strange that programs interested in getting more couples to use contraception for spacing often count it as a
“failure” when such couples stop contraception and have another child.

In terms of these different program goals,
it is important to ask this question: What is
the post-insertion fertility history of couples
who say that they have had all the children
they want? In Table 2, we show the postinsertion fertility history separately for the
couples who still wanted more children and
for those who had all they wanted or more

view.! This clarifies considerably the general
trends shown in Table 1.

The couples who have had all the children
they wanted were remarkably successful in
keeping their fertility rates very low. Even
30 months after insertion only 8% of these
couples had borne a child. This is very much
less than might otherwise have been expected. On the other hand, among those who
did not have all the children they wanted,
40% had borne at least one child within 30

months. Presumably, additional couples
will go on to have children in the following

The determination of whether a woman had
more children than she wanted was made by comparing the number of children she had with the
number she wanted at the time of interview and not
at the time of insertion. Changes may have occurred
between these two dates. For example, a woman
who now reports she has all the children she wants
may have had less than she wanted at the time of
interview, experienced a live birth in the interval,
and now is at her desired level. In this case, the live
birth is not a failure of the program or of her plans.
By the same token, a woman who had all the children she wanted at the time of insertion may have
had a live birth and may have adjusted her desired
family size to account for this.

It should also be noted that a related variable
used in this analysis, whether the women accepted
the IUCD for limiting or spacing purposes, was also
obtained at the time of interview. In this case we are
obtaining retrospectively her purpose at the time of
insertion. Though both variables are obtained at the
time of interview, the reference period is different
for the two variables.

months, although it is likely that some of
them either will change their minds about
having additional children or will be unable
to conceive when they want to do so.

The proportion of acceptors having a
birth within specific six-month segments
following the insertion is shown in Table 3
for 3,519 couples who used no contraception
before the IUCD, about 75% of all acceptors. Their post-insertion fertility experience
can be compared with their prior fertility
experience without contraception. The very
low observed rate (Table 3, Col. 1) for 7-12
months after insertion is understandable
since these births result from conceptions
during the first three months after insertion.
After the first year, the proportion having a
live birth in successive 6-month periods
ranges from 3 to 5%, with a slight decline
after the peak at 19-24 months.

These observed rates are very low as compared with expected fertility without contraception based on the prior fertility experience of either the acceptors or of the
general married population of childbearing
age who did not use contraception between
marriage and date of interview. Column 2

Social Biology

of Table 3 presents the “expected” proportions obtained by fitting a curve to prior
fertility rates of acceptors by duration of
marriage for the period from marriage to
the time of insertion. The estimating equation with duration of marriage as a principal
component is given by Jain and Hermalin
(1969). The resulting expected rates are 68
to 78% higher than those actually observed
in six-month segments after the first year.

“Expected” fertility rates for the noncontraceptive experience of the general
population of married women were derived
in the same way (Table 3, Col. 3). The general married population includes sterile
couples and others with low fertility which
obviates the need for contraception. Therefore, their expected rates are lower than
those based on the pre-insertion experience
of the acceptors. Still, even these expectations for the general population are from 62
to 74% higher than the observed post-insertion fertility of the acceptors.

The post-insertion fertility decline of
65-80% as compared with the expected
values without contraception is in the same
range as other comparisons in Taiwan and

It may seem almost self-evident that a large
group taking up the practice of contraception should then have much lower fertility
rates. However, there are many examples of
programs in which termination rates are

program contraception, but also on the prior
and subsequent birth-control practice of
the terminators.

Establishing a significant fertility decline
for acceptors is not documenting a self-evident truth; it is an important step in evaluating the impact of a family-planning program. Whether the program caused the
decline depends on whether the acceptors,
especially those who did not use any contraception prior to the [UCD, would have taken substitute birth-control action without
the program, and that is difficult to determine. However, the fact of a large post-program reduction in fertility makes the question moot.

The two distributions of expected fertility
that we have used for comparison with the
observed fertility are based essentially on
fertility by duration of marriage for relevant
populations. Chang, Liu, and Chow (1969)
have tried to take additional factors into
account by comparing IUCD acceptors in
several townships of Tatwan with presumed
nonacceptors, matched on the wife’s age,
education, number of living children, and
number of months since last birth. In that
study, the acceptors had a fertility rate 62%
below that of the matched cases in the follow-up period. Of course, the pre-insertion
fertility of acceptors and matched cases was
about equal, by the design of the study.
Their estimate of fertility reduction on quite
a different basis is roughly comparable with
the results in the present analysis.

CORRELATES OF POST-INSERTION
FERTILITY

Post-insertion fertility understandably
varies with some family life-cycle characteristics. However, it is important to stress first
of all that post-insertion fertility is remarkably low for every subgrouping considered
(Table 4). For example, 18 months after insertion, only 13% of the women under 25 and
8% of those 25-29 years old had borne another child. Table 4 presents cumulative fer
Social Biology

tility rates for the period 18 months after insertion, both for all acceptors and then separately for those who did and those who did
not want more children. The following
statements are based on these data.

1. Regardless of their characteristics, those
who wanted no more children had substantially fewer children than those who
wanted more. This finding is not surprising, but it is far from inevitable. What is
demonstrated is that those who do not
want more children are highly successful
in achieving their goal. The categories in
which wanting or not wanting more children makes little difference are those in
which the rates are very low regardless of
whether more children were wanted (e.g.,
among couples with two or more induced
abortions). One exception is the rather peculiar situation for the 100 wives who reported that they wanted no more children,
but that they took the IUCD for spacing
purposes! Though this may represent inconsistent reporting in part, it should be
noted that the attitudes in question refer
to different time periods (see note 1).
The high proportion of births to this
group is consistent with accepting for
spacing, having a birth and then reporting, at time of interview, that no more
children are desired.

2. The fertility rates are remarkably low at
18 months whether we consider all acceptors or even those who wanted more children. For example, consider women in the
highly fecund age group 20-24? Only 13%
of all acceptors (and 18% of those who
wanted another child) had a baby within
18 months. We must recognize that since
almost none of the women were pregnant
at insertion, their real risk period for births
is only 9 months. Even so, these rates are
very much lower than those for the average Taiwanese married women 20-24 years
old. (Compare the IUCD case rate of
13-18% with the 35% expected for all
Taiwanese married women 20-24 for a 9month period in 1966.) Remember, too,
that the IUCD cases are more fecund than
the total population, which includes sterile
women and women of low fecundability.
Further, the rate for all of Taiwan includes
some effects of birth-control practice also.
At age 25-29, 26% of all Taiwanese married women could be expected to have a
baby in 9 months as compared with the
actual rate of 8% for all acceptors in 18
months (and 19% for those who wanted

? Almost all the women shown in the 16-24 age
group in the tables are 20-24 years of age.

another child). When the 18-month acceptor rates are standardized for age, there is
no subcategory of any characteristic considered in which the 18-month rate approaches the rate of 18% which would be
expected if all acceptors had for 9 months
the marital age specific birth rates for all
of Taiwan. What all of this comes to is
that the IUCD acceptors, a highly fecundable group, succeeded in keeping their
birth rates low for 18 months after the insertion, regardless of whether their initial
intention was to space or limit their chilren.

3. Better-educated women were more likely
to have had a child than the less well-educated, because the better-educated women
were younger and therefore much more
likely to still want more children. When
the educational rates are standardized for
age, differences become trivial.

4. Women who had previously used induced
abortion or contraception had significantly
lower birth rates than others, especially
among those who still wanted more children. We interpret prior use of abortion
and/or contraception as evidence of strong
prior motivation for birth control and some
knowledge of alternatives to the TUCD.

5. It is certainly not surprising that birth
rates were highest for those most dissatisfied with the IUCD, especially since these
satisfaction statements included the responses of those who got pregnant and had
a child either with an [UCD insitu or after
giving up the IUCD. What is surprising
is that even among those saying they were
very dissatisfied only 12% had a birth.

The correlates of the 18-month birth rates
for only those women who had terminated
the IUCD are shown in Table 5 in comparison with rates for all acceptors. Obviously,
these rates will be higher than those for all
women, since the terminators include women who got pregnant with an IUCD in
place, or stopped to have a child, or simply
got pregnant because they failed to use another method when they gave up the IUCD.

What is notable again here is that even
for the terminators, the proportions having
a live birth within 18 months were quite low
in every category (see Table 6). The rates
are less than the rates for all married women,
considering similar age distributions. Only
those with fewer children than they wanted

* Indirect standardization based on the distribution of age at
insertion. The age-specific proportions were applied to the age
distribution in each category to yield an expected rate, E. Then
the standardized rate was defined as O/E X T, where O is the
observed rate for the category, E is the expected rate, and T is
the overa)l rate for all acceptors,

¢ Prior to first insertion,

terminated by expulsion. All of these are
subgroups in which relatively high rates are
to be expected, especially among terminators. The high rate among those terminating
by expulsion, which appears puzzling at
first glance, may be due to the fact that expulsions are selective of younger women and
and occur relatively soon after insertion, so
that the period without the IUCD is on the
average greater than for other terminations.

CONCLUSION

This paper has shown that the post-insertion fertility of women who accepted an
IUCD in the family-planning program was
Slow in relation to what might have been excopected under various assumptions. The level
» of post-insertion fertility was seen to despend, quite obviously, on whether or not the
‘=women terminated the IUCD and, less ob‘viously, on whether or not the women wantSed more children. Other characteristics had
.2an effect as well, including age, number of
living sons, and prior use of contraception
>or abortion.

Table 7 provides a summary of our findngs. In Column 1 the actual proportion of
women in each group who had a live birth
in 18 months is shown. In Column 2 we
show the expected proportion who would

have had a live birth within 9 months, if the
women in the category followed the agespecific marital fertility pattern of all Taiwanese women in 1966. We subtracted 9
months of exposure to adjust for the fact
that women are not pregant at the time they
accept an IUCD.* However, it should be
noted that this is an overly conservative adjustment for this factor.

Grants from the Ford Foundation and the
National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development provided support for this research
at the University of Michigan. Support for the
work in Taiwan came in part from the Population Council. Roger C. Avery and Robert G.
Potter, Jr., provided helpful comments on an
earlier draft. J. Michael Coble and Caroline
Lee provided valuable programming assistance;
Silvia Rodriguez and Sandra Welch assisted
with the computations and organization of the
manuscript.

3 It should also be noted that the women who accepted an IUCD have a shorter average open birth
interval (the time between last live birth and insertion) than do married women in general (as measured by the time between last live birth and interview in a cross-sectional sample). Thus, more of the
acceptors are likely to be in a period of postpartum
amenorrhea, although they do not constitute a large
proportion of all acceptors. The average overlap of
IUCD coverage with the amenorrheic period is quite
small for all acceptors. Therefore, we felt that subtracting nine months of exposure from the acceptors
adequately accounts for this factor as well as for the
difference in pregnancy status.
