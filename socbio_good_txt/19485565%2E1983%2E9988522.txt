Inbreeding Among Three Endogamous Groups in a
Multicaste Village of Andhra Pradesh, India

ABSTRACT: The frequency of consanguineous marriages was studied in three endogamous
castes, the Reddis (Kapus), Yadavas (Gollas), and Madigas of Marripadu village in South
India. Inbreeding was higher among the Yadavas (Gollas) (0.0312) and Madigas (0.0271) than
among the Reddis (Kapus) (0.0154) due to their higher frequencies of uncle-niece marriages.

Studies in many parts of the world
have shown a significant decline in the
frequency of consanguineous marriages
(Pohiman, 1951; Deraemaeker, 1958;
Blanco and Chakrahorty, 1975, etc.).
However, in South India over the past
few decdes consanguineous marriages
have not declined significantly (Andhra
Pradesh: Dronam Raju and
Meerakhan, 1963; Sanghvi, 1966; Chakravartti, 1968; Reid, 1973; Veerraju,
1973; Rami Reddy and Papa Rao,

Rao and Inbaraj, 1977; and Roychoudhury, 1978; Karnatka: Roychoudhury, 1976; Kerala: Ali, 1968; and
Kumar et al., 1967). South Indian populations provide an excellent opportunity
for studying the genetic effects of inbreeding since they are known to practice various types of consanguineous
marriages. The present study reports
the results of an empirical study conducted in 1978, aimed at understanding
the pattern of consanguinity and levels
of inbreeding in three different ethnic
groups—Reddis (Kapus), Yadavas
(Gollas), and Madigas from a village in
Andhra Pradesh in South India.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were collected from the
multicaste village of Marripadu, in
Kovur taluk, Nellore District, Andhra
Pradesh. The sample of 209 marriages
includes 59 Reddis (Kapus), an agricultural caste; 82 Yadavas (Gollas), a shepherd caste; and 68 Madigas, a scheduled
caste. Information on the different types
of consanguineous marriages was ascertained from the detailed pedigrees
drawn on oral information from respondents’ families and village elders. The
mean inbreeding coefficient was calculated for the three groups separately following Wright (1922).

RESULTS

The pattern of consanguineous marriages and inbreeding coefficients shown
in Table 1 reveals that the consanguinity
rate in the samples of our study varied
from 25 per cent to 40 per cent. Uncleniece marriages occur in a higher frequency in Yadavas (Gollas) and Madigas than in the Reddis (Kapus). The
frequency of matrilateral cross-cousin
marriages, however, was found to be

higher in Reddis (Kapus) and Madigas
than in Yadavas (Gollas). There is a
negligible difference in the frequency of
marriages between first cousins once removed and second cousins. Marriages
of second cousins once removed are
prevalent only among the Yadavas
(Gollas). The average inbreeding coefficients were: Yadavas (Gollas)
(0.0312); Madigas (0.0271); and Reddis
(Kapus) (0.0154).

DISCUSSION

In our study the major contribution
to the average inbreeding coefficient
comes from the uncle-niece and crossfirst-cousin types of marriages. Of the
three caste groups studied, the Reddis
(Kapus) showed the lowest inbreeding
coefficient due to the low frequency of
uncle-niece marriages; in Yadavas (Gollas) and Madigas, the frequencies of
such marriages are slightly higher than
those of cross-first-cousin marriages.

Our findings, except for those on the
Reddis (Kapus), differ from those of
Sanghvi (1966) who earlier reported
higher frequencies of consanguineous
marriages between matrilateral crosscousins in rural Andhra Pradesh. However, Sundar Rao (1971) observed in
Tamil Nadu populations a significant decline in the frequency of cross-firstcousin marriages but not in uncle-niece
marriages.

The foregoing account shows that the
practice of consanguinity varies from
ethnic group to ethnic group, which is
most likely due to diverse cultural practices of deep-rooted origin and antiquity. Hence the preference for certain
types of related marriages is witnessed
even today in different proportions in
various ethnic groups including the samples of our study.
