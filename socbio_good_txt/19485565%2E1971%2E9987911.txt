Demographic and Genetic Interrelationships
among the Cayapo Indians of Brazil

The Cayapo Indians are generally classified as members of the Northwestern branch
of the Ge linguistic family (Lowie, 1946;
Tax, 1960). In former times they were subdivided into Northern and Southern groups,
which occupied a vast region in Central and
Northern Brazil.

The Southern bands are now extinct. The
Northern Cayapo live at present in eight
semi-independent communities in the states
of Para and Mato Grosso, reaching from
latitude 5° to 10° S. and from longitude 51°
to 54° W. (Fig. 1). The Xikrin or Djore subgroup is divided into two populations, one,
numbering about 150 individuals, located
near the Caeteté river, an affluent of the left
margin of the Itacaiunas, and a smaller one
with about 90 persons, living near the
Bacaja river. The Mekranoti are also located
in two communities; about 30 of them live
with 60 Kararaé in a place called Bau (lat.
6°35’ S., long. 51°90’ W.), while the remaining 240 are in the Iriri river region (lat.
8°40’ S., long. 54° W.). Some 260 Gorotire
live in a post of the National Indian Foundation near the Fresco River (lat. 7°44’ S.,
long., 51°10’ W.), while the Ko-krai-moro,
numbering about 150, live in the Serra Encontrada (lat. 7°28’ S., long. 52°44’ W.).
The largest present Cayapo group Is represented by the Kuben-Kran-Kegn; some 310

 

individuals are located near the Riosinho
river, an affluent of the Fresco (lat. 8°10’ S.,
long. 52°8’ W.); finally the Txukahamae or
Mentuktire, numbering some 190 persons,
live in the Xingu National Park in the
northern region of the state of Mato Grosso,
in a place called Porori. Therefore, at present the whole Cayapo population does not
total 1,500 individuals. This figure should be
compared with an estimate of the last century made by H. Coudreau, who calculated a
population of 5,000 for these Indians.

A large number of authors have studied
special aspects of the Cayapo culture and
language (references in Baldus, 1954, 1968),
but definitive research about their social
structure and organization are still lacking.
Perhaps the most important recent investigations are those of Dreyfus (1963) on the
social life and culture of the Gorotire and
Kuben-Kran-Kegn and those of Frikel
(1968) on the material culture of the Xikrin.
T. S. Turner has gathered much material
from different groups for his still unpublished thesis. On the biological side, Bellizzi
(1958, 1961) has studied some of the Cayapo
anthropometrically and in relation to
health; Mattos (1958) measured the vision
acuity and color vision of 73 Gorotire Indians; Nutels, Ayres, and Salzano (1967)
performed tuberculin tests, x-ray and bac

and Gorotire. The first became extinct; the
Xikrin have remained as a distinct branch
ever since, dividing into two groups around
1956, while the Gorotire have suffered several fissions and fusions. The first split
among them occurred around 1905, giving
rise to the Mekranoti subgroup. The latter
divided again, with part of the population
going to the Xingu area and the remaining
to the Iriri region. A new fission then occurred in the Xingu population, the result
being the present Txukahamae, while the
other faction joined a dissident group from
the Iriri band, remaining with them in that
area. The Bau population is a result of the
fusion of the Kararaé, who separated from
the Gorotire around 1936, and part of the
Mekranoti of the Iriri. A further subdivision
of the Gorotire are the Kuben-Kran-Kegn;
this split occurred also around 1936 when
the Gorotire had their first contacts with
Neo-Brazilians. A few years afterwards the
Ko-krai-moro diverged as a sub-branch of
the Kuben-Kran-Kegn.

The degree of acculturation of these populations varies considerably, and this is of
course related to the time of contact between them and the Neo-Brazilians as well
as to the nature of these contacts and the
degree of geographic isolation. The first
group to establish relatively stable relations
with Neo-Brazilians were the Gorotire and
this occurred in 1937. All the other groups
were pacified in the fifties, as follows: the
Kuben-Kran-Kegn in 1952; the Txukahamae in 1953; the Xikrin in 1954; the Kokrai-moro in 1957; and the Mekranoti
(Iriri and Bau) in 1958. According to Turner
(unpublished), Frikel (1963), and my own
observations, I would rank these groups in
terms of acculturation in the following order. The most acculturated are the Gorotire
and Xikrin; then come the Ko-krai-moro
and Kuben-Kran-Kegn; last come the
Txukahamae and Mekranoti (Iriri and Bau)
populations, the most “untouched” of all.

Since 1965 my collaborators and myself
have been obtaining demographic, medical,

Social Biology

morphological, and genetic information
among these Indians, part of the material
being also sent to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for
special studies by J. V. Neel and co-workers.
A first paper about the health situation
among the Txukahamae has already been
published (Nutels, Ayres, and Salzano,
1967); the present communication is the
first of a series in which these other results
will be reported.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The demographic data which will be presented here were collected in four expeditions to three Cayapo communities as follows: (1) The first visit to the Kuben-KranKegn was from July 13 to 26, 1965. Since at
that time many of the Indians were away
hunting, a second trip was made and new
information obtained during the period September 15-27, 1968. (2) Field work among
the Txukahamae was performed from June
19 to July 7, 1966. (3) Studies of the
Mekranoti (Iriri) were made from May 21 to
June 2, 1969,

The collection of information was made
by interviews with one or both members of
each nuclear family who always came with
their children. The questions asked involved: (1) name of the spouses; (2) birthplace; (3) parents’ names; (4) parents’ sibs;
(5) relationship between the parents’ sibs;
(6) sibs; (7) number of children alive and
dead; (8) stillbirths; (9) names, sex, and
ages of the living children; (10) ages and sex
of dead children; (11) birthplaces of all
members of the family; (12) information
about those who left the community; and
(13) other marriages of one or both spouses.

In these interviews I was assisted among
the Kuben-Kran-Kegn by the Indian Kurik6, among the Txukahamae by Rop-ni, and
among the Mekranoti by the missionary
Dale Snyder. These interpreters understood
Portuguese well and since they knew all
members of the group very well their assistance was of great importance to ascertain
the reliability of the information.

Vol. 18, No. 2

The ages of all persons were estimated by
visual inspection by two independent observers. Afterwards, in the laboratory, these

two estimates were compared and final:

agreement reached, sometimes using additional information from the reproductive
histories and other sources, The mean difference between these two observers calculated
for 137 adults was of the order of two years.
An additional source of information among
the Txukahamae was the complete genealogy of the group, obtained by Dr. T. S.
Turner in 1965-66. Since only recent consanguinity could be ascertained through the
present methodology, this genealogy provided a good check into the efficiency of the
method.

AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION

Table 1 presents the data in the three
populations studied. The differences in age
distribution among the three groups are not

Cayapo Indians

151

pronounced; the Txukahamae, however, are
in general younger than the Kuben-KranKegn, the Mekranoti showing intermediate
values. In mean age, the differences between
the two extreme groups are of the order of
three years among males and four years
among females, About half of the individuals
have not reached the age of reproduction
among the Txukahamae, while this fraction
was only about a third among the KubenKran-Kegn. In general, however, the age
distribution is similar to those observed
among other hunters and gatherers with incipient agriculture. The sex ratio showed
some fluctuations, perhaps due to the small
sizes of these populations. It is noteworthy
that in two of the communities it was lower
than 100, an unexpected finding in populations at this level of technological advance
(for comparative data on these and other
demographic parameters in American Indians and Eskimos, see Salzano, 1971).

ENDOGAMY AND INBREEDING

Tables 2-4 furnish information about
these variables (see also the column about
admixture rates in Table 9). The three populations show similar rates of endogamy

(about 75% endogamous marriages) with
admixture rates ranging from 13% to 17%.
These figures are similar to those observed
among other hunters and gatherers with
incipient agriculture.

Following Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza
(1968) I have presented in Table 3 the backward stochastic migration matrix for the
three groups studied. It shows the probabilities that children born in these three places
have parents derived from other Cayapo
populations. As shown, the main contributors of outside genes to the Txukahamae are
the Ko-krai-moro; the importance of the
exchange between the Mekranoti and Kuben-Kran-Kegn is also apparent, each being
the main source of outside genes to the
other.

The average inbreeding coefficients are
presented in Table 4, There is a marked difference between the Mekranoti and Txukahamae on the one hand and the KubenKran-Kegn on the other, While among the
first the inbreeding coefficients have been
estimated as 0.0022 to 0.0028, in the latter
this value is much lower (0.0003). The average coefficient obtained from data of the
three populations is somewhat low for Indian populations at this cultural level (Salzano, 1970). An attempt was made, using
T. S. Turner’s complete genealogy of the

Cayapo Indians

153

Txukahamae, to verify how inefficient the
method employed to collect consanguinity
information was for detecting remote inbreeding. Only two more consanguineous
marriages were ascertained using the complete genealogy, and due to the inclusion of
marriages not considered in my census the
average inbreeding coefficient calculated
using this information would actually be
lower (0.0026) than the one estimated. It is
concluded, therefore, that while the values
presented in Table 4 are underestimates due
to the lack of information about remote consanguinity, no better estimates could probably be obtained in these populations using
demographic data only.

FERTILITY AND MORTALITY

The data on reproduction and survival
are presented in Tables 5-8. Monogamy is
the rule among these populations, but there
are many comments about sexual freedom.
Several cases of women who are not formally married and serve as mistresses for the
men in the village were also observed. As is
shown in Table 5, the average number of

live births per married female over the age
of 15 is higher among the Txukahamae
(3.8 + 0.3) than among the Kuben-KranKegn (2.4 + 0.2), the average among the
Mekranoti showing an intermediate value.
The total, considering the three populations
(3.0 + 0.2), is in the lower range of equivalent estimates made among hunters and
gatherers with incipient agriculture (Salzano, 1970). The number of liveborn offspring in completed sibships (Table 6) is
intermediate in relation to those previous
findings, the variance being somewhat low.
The percentage of childless marriages (no
liveborn offspring after three years of life in
common) varied among the three localities.
No such marriages were observed in 42
couples among the Mekranoti, one in 56
among the Txukahamae, but five in 105
among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn. The incidence in the last group is of the same order
of magnitude as that observed among the
Caingang (about 5%; see Salzano, 1961,
1964).

Taking into consideration the mortality
observed (Tables 7 and 9), all the populations studied seem to be at or somewhat
above the replacement level. As for the
average number of surviving offspring per

Cayapo Indians

155

female who had at least one liveborn child
(Table 7), the values are similar in the three
Cayapo groups, showing that the lower birth
rate among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn is compensated by a low death rate (the decrease
in relation to the livebirth average is 32%
among the Txukahamae, but only 17%
among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn). The averages found are within the range observed in
tribes living at this cultural level (Salzano,
1970). The numbers for the surviving offspring in completed sibships are shown in
Table 8. They are again intermediate in relation to previous findings, with a low variance.

BREEDING SIZE, EFFECTIVE SIZE,
AND SELECTION POTENTIAL

Two important parameters in the genetic
structure of a population are their breeding
and effective sizes. In the Indian groups
studied so far the breeding sizes varied from
38% to 46% and the effective sizes from
21% to 46% of their total populations (Salzano, 1970). The values observed among the
Cayapo (37%-39%; 33%-37%) are at the
lower end for the first variable and are intermediate in relation to the second.

vised by Crow (1958) furnishes a convenient
number which indicates the intensity with
which selective factors can act in a population through fertility and mortality differences. Due to the relatively low mortality
observed among the Cayapo (compared to
those prevailing in populations at this same
level of technological advance), as well as
their relatively small variance in completed
family sizes, they show one of the lowest indices of potential selection calculated so far
in American Indian tribes (0.71). As a matter of fact, the only lower index was the one
calculated for the Terena (0.63; see Salzano
and Cardoso de Oliveira, 1970). The others
observed among hunters and gatherers with
incipient agriculture were: Yanomama,
0.88; and Xavante, 0.90. Those calculated
from data obtained among agriculturalists
and tribes somewhat acculturated were, besides the Terena value, the following: Maca,
0.88; Caingang, 1.29; and Ramah Navaho,
2.53 (for references, see Salzano, 1970).

DISCUSSION

Taken as a whole, the three Cayapo populations studied show similar age distributions and endogamy rates but low sex-ratio
and inbreeding rates in relation to those prevailing among tribes at this level of cultural
development. Fertility is moderate with a
small variance, and mortality low. However,
while the three groups show similarity
among themselves for sex ratio, endogamy,
number of surviving offspring and the percentage of breeding, and effective sizes in
relation to the total population, dissimilarities can be observed as well. In particular,
the Txukahamae and Kuben-Kran-Kegn
show clear differences among themselves,
the latter having an older age distribution,
lower inbreeding, an average number of liveborn children and mortality rates, and a
relatively high incidence of childless marriages. It is reasonable to suppose that these
differences are due to the more advanced

process of acculturation prevailing among
the Kuben-Kran-Kegn.

Despite these differences all three populations are at or somewhat above the replacement level. These findings may appear inconsistent with the depopulation rate that
can be calculated from the fact that only
1,500 Cayapo Indians survive from a probable population of 5,000 estimated in the
last century. It should be clear, however,
that the Txukahamae and Mekranoti are
having only intermittent contacts with NeoBrazilians, and that while among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn these contacts have been of
a longer duration, they are still relatively
isolated. The situation may be different
among more acculturated groups, like the
Gorotire and Xikrin, and the devastating
effects of the first shocks with our culture
(both in terms of violent deaths and decimation by epidemics), even if generally undocumented, should be considered as well.

The recent history of these Cayapo populations shows striking similarities with those
observed among the Xavante and Yanomama Indians. This adds new evidence indicating that the fission-fusion pattern of
genetic structure proposed by Neel and Salzano (1967) may in fact be a general feature
of groups of hunters and gatherers with incipient agriculture.

SUMMARY

Three populations of Cayapo Indians
from southern Para and northern Mato
Grosso, Brazil, in general show similar age
distributions and endogamy rates, but low
sex ratios and inbreeding rates when compared to those prevailing among other South
American hunters and gatherers with incipient agriculture. Their fertility is moderate
with a small variance, and mortality is low.
The index of opportunity for selection,
therefore, is one of the lowest calculated so
far for groups at this cultural stage. Some
differences were observed’among the three

populations in some of the demographic
variables and they were attributed to acculturation, which is occurring at different
rates among them. In accordance with
previous studies in other South American
tribes, the pattern of exchange between local
groups can be better described in terms of
the fission-fusion model of genetic structure.
