Social and demographic structures are
fundamental determinants of the genetic
structures of human populations (CavalliSforza, 1962; Sutter, 1963; Spuhler, 1963;
Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza, 1967).

Some relationships and interactions between sociodemographic and genetic parameters of human populations have been studied. Theoretical and empirical precedents
in North American Indian population research have been set by Spuhler and Kluckhohn (1953), Hulse (1955), Kraus and
White (1956), Woolf and Grant (1962),
Woolf (1965), Hackenberg (1967, 1972),
Walker (1967), Woolf and Dukepoo
(1969), Workman and Niswander (1970),
Smith (1972), and others.

These investigations notwithstanding,
genetic demography has been belatedly
and restrictedly incorporated into the designs and strategies of research on North
American Indian populations,

Genetic and epidemiologic research in
North American reservation communities
has suggested hypothetical relationships
between these population structures and
prevalent diseases which are otherwise rare
in North America (e.g., Corrigan and Segal, 1950; Birt, 1968; Niswander, 1968;

Ives, 1969). However, hypothesis testing
has been restricted by lack of data collected
within a context appropriate to genetic
analyses. The requisite course to such
analyses is through an integrated application of social, genetic, and demographic
methods in population research (e.g.,
WHO, 1964, 1968, 1971).

THE GREATER LEECH LAKE
RESERVATION PROJECT

Research on the demographic-genetic
structure of the Ojibwa population, resident at Greater Leech Lake Reservation
in northern Minnesota, was initiated in
1966. Initial objectives included: (1) description of the blood group and serum
protein genetic variation within the contemporary population; (2) description of
the demographic structures of the reservation and its communities; and (3) analysis of social, demographic, and genetic
components of the population structure.

The present report includes: (1) a general characterization of the reservation system and population; (2) description of our
research strategy and methods; (3) general
observations on the demographic samples

selected and; (4) working hypotheses derived from our initial analyses.

THE RESERVATION SYSTEM AND
POPULATION

The Greater Leech Lake Indian Reservation is Jocated in the north-central region of the state of Minnesota.

The reservation is an “open” system,
the origin of which has been described by
Roufs (1967). In 1970, 26,766 acres of
land, 5% of the original reservation, was
held as Indian trust or government land.
Individual allotments accounted for 12,963
acres, while tribal land included 14,069
acres (BIA, 1970). This division contrasts
with the 564,426 acres of tribal land, 100%
of the original reservation, characteristic of
the “closed” Red Lake reservation in northern Minnesota.

The open system gave rise to clusters
of Indian and non-Indian residents in the
area once given entirely to reservation. In
some cases, Indian communities were appended to those of the growing non-Indian
population. In others, the population was
primarily of Ojibwa ethnic affinity.1 The
distribution of these communities, within
the reservation and/or Chippewa National
Forest, is illustrated in Figure 1.

Lakes, swamps, rivers, and streams are
the major geographic features affecting
community distribution. The average annual rainfall is approximately 27 inches.
Seasonality is extreme, temperatures ranging between highs of over 90 degrees in
July and August and lows of 40 degrees
below zero in December and January
(GLLSU, 1965).

The economy of the region is depressed

1Ethnic and linguistic affiliation are not implicitly correlated with and through geneticdemographic derivation. Among communities on

- the Leech Lake Reservation, several have exhib
ited strong cultural or ethnic affiliation with
Ojibwa in association with the highest estimates
of admixture with non-Indians.

as illustrated by the following indicators
(LWVM, 1971).

1. Median family income for the total
reservation population of Indians
and non-Indians in 1969 was $1,500.

2. Eighty per cent of Indian and nonIndian families had annual incomes
below the $3,000 U.S. Government
poverty limit.

3. Seventy per cent of the Indian families are in substandard housing, 50%
without running water or sewage disposal.

RESEARCH STRATEGY

The size of the resident population required a sampling method.? Dispersal of
reservation communities and economic considerations dictated use of a single sampling
locale. The U.S. Public Health Service
Indian Hospital, located in the village of
Cass Lake, was selected. Advantages of
this locale included:

1. the hospital as a comprehensive
health facility, utilized by the total
“registered” reservation population;

2. astaff to collect serological specimens
for genetic analyses;

3. a source of health records for use in
the demographic characterization of
the population.

We assumed that the reservation hospital would present a random sample from
the population and each of the villages.
However, the size of the sample from each
village was assumed to be affected by actual size and distance from the sampling
locale.$

2 Available estimates of the resident Indian
population in 1968 averaged approximately 2,400
individuals. Primary among our concerns was a
genetic characterization of the demographic population from which the sample was drawn.

3In studies of genetic differentiation, the
sample drawn from a village, region, etc., should
reproduce that proportionate contribution to the
total population. In actual experience, distance

The assumption that the sample from
each village is random can be supported
if all individuals marry and have equal
fertility. Differential fertility could result
in the sample being biased toward larger
families when individuals serve as sampling
units. Systematic bias in favor of larger

through individuals, without replacement.
Once an individual from a family was
sampled, the members of that family unit
were removed, for sampling purposes, from
the remaining population of the village
Sampling units, ascertained through the individual demographic-genetic index cases,
were defined as nuclear families. These, in

turn, were utilized as the points from which
demographic records of extended family
units were constructed.

Hospital staff were instructed to select,
as randomly as possible, those individuals
from whom a serological specimen was to
be drawn. Restriction on sampling was exercised in cases of severe acute or chronic
disease and children under five years of
age. An alphabetic list of individuals and
families sampled was provided to hospital
technicians as a control over multiple ascertainments.

Four primary sources of demographic
data were used to establish the record for
each index case. These included:

1, administrative band lists, prepared
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for
the Greater Leech Lake, White
Earth, Nett Lake, Fond du Lac,
Mille Lacs, and Grand Portage Reservations;

2. medical histories and records maintained in the Medical Records Unit
of the Cass Lake Indian Hospital;

3. copies of birth and death certificates,
recorded for the Minnesota Department of Health;

4. responses to an informal, oral, recall
questionnaire elicited from selected
informants. .

The following data were recorded, from
one or more of the data sources, for the
record of each index case:

1. name, including surname, married
and given names; sex; birthdate;

2. birthplace and the residence at the
time of sampling;

3. mame, for each of the biological
mother, father, and all siblings; dates
of birth; alive or deceased; if alive,
the residence at the time of sampling;
the age or date and residence at time
of death for decedents;

4, marital status, including unmarried,

married, widowed or divorced and/or
combinations thereof;

5. treaty band affiliation and fraction
Indian ancestry;

6. if married, widowed or divorced, the
name(s) and the birthdate(s) or
age(s) of the spouse(s) ;

7. if widowed, the age and residence of
the spouse(s) at death;

8. if married or divorced, the residence
of the spouse(s) at the time of sampling;

9. all progeny by name, birthdate, sex,
biological or adopted, alive or deceased, including miscarriage and
stillbirth; age and place of death for
decedents, residence for living.

Genealogical reconstruction of consanguineal extended families was effected by
consideration of each individual within the
record of a primary index case as a secondary case, those within secondary records
as tertiary cases, etc. Affinal relatives were
utilized as points of entry into other extended families.

All lineages were investigated to information extinction in both the identification
of index cases and the compilation of individual records. Extinction occurred when
we observed:

1. non-Indian admixture (information
on non-Indian relatives was, without
exception, meagre) ;

2. emigration (collateral and affinal
relatives were recalled with difficulty
by our informants and records often
lacked desired precision or time
depth) ;

3. age (some index cases predate most
demographic records and heavy reliance on informant recall).

Individual records were linked through
common biological founders into biological
sibships, extended families, and lineages.
Thereafter, the following conversions and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 20, No. 4 Reservation
additions were made to the individual
records:

1. surnames were converted to a fourdigit code;

2. given names were converted to a fivedigit identification number assigned
in order of decreasing age in the
total population, i.e., oldest individuals received the lowest numbers and
youngest individuals, the highest;

3. sequential sibship codes were added
to each record in accordance with the
method of Maclean (1969);

4. two-digit, numeric treaty-band numbers were assigned through a patrilineal principle;

5. fraction Indian ancestry was converted to a scale ranging from 0/8
Indian, for a non-Indian parent of
an Indian child, through 8/8 Indian.

Band affiliation and ancestry were
checked directly against the genealogies for
concordance in assignment. We assumed
only that the founder designations for
affiliation and ancestry constituted baselines from which systematic assignment
could follow. When we were unable to “‘establish” paternity, the maternal band affiliation was assigned. Such individuals were
assigned the designation “ancestry-unknown.”

Residence patterns and distributions
were reevaluated in the terminal stages of
data collection (December, 1968). Frequently, the residence of the index cases
had changed, either within or to outside of
the sampling area. Often, individuals had
two or more geographic areas of seasonal
or otherwise typical habitation. “Usual”
residence was therefore defined as that in
which an individual spent the majority of
his or her time on an annual basis. In most
cases, the usual residence was occupied for
more than 50% of the year. For transient

Populations 431
individuals, the duration of usual residence
was often less than 25% of the year.

Demographic records at our disposal indicated residence for each individual in a
“major” village population center, rather
than the actual village of residence. Informants, on the other hand, were requested
to be specific in the assignment of usual
residence to index cases. Persistent reevaluation of residence patterns resulted in
equations of residential equivalence. Such
residential equivalents were defined as
aggregates of villages, any of which constituted an appropriate response to the
question of usual residence. These are,
typically, geographic clusters which grade
into one another in settlement pattern.

A third-order residential classification,
based upon band-equivalent regions, has
been useful in preliminary organization and
data analysis. The Greater Leech Lake
Reservation is an amalgamation of three
reservations. These were initially allotted
to the Cass-Winnibigoshish, Leech Lake
Pillager, and White Oak Point treaty bands.
Prior to treaty in 1855, each treaty band
consisted of one or more “bands” which
ranged within and outside of the allotted
territory. Contemporary villages can be
equated through presence within one of the
three band-equivalent geographic regions.

Two problems have arisen with this
classification. First, the villages of Cass
Lake and Bena occupy positions “within”
the three regions. Cass Lake occupies this
position through historic developments as
an economic and administrative center,
while for Bena the position is geographic.
Accordingly, these two villages have been
considered a fourth region, B. Second, the
region of Inger-Bowstring Lake is on the
border of the territories of the Cass-Winnibigoshish and White Oak Point bands.
This has been resolved by treating the
community within either or both of the
regions in analysis.

We have found it useful to distinguish
“online” and peripheral reservation communities. U.S. Highway #2 bisects the
reservation, passing through, from west to
east, Cass Lake, Bena, Ball Club, and Deer
River. These “online” communities correspond, broadly, to the modern communities
described on the Papago Reservation by
Hackenberg (1972). Peripheral communities occur within the remainder of bandequivalent regions I-III.

THE OJIBWA POPULATION

Primary index cases include 518 individuals, 227 males and 291 females. The
sex and age composition of the index sample, by ten-year intervals, is presented in
Table 1. This distribution is consistent

with expectation when a health facility or
program is used as sampling locale. Females
frequently accompany the young and elderly to clinics, etc., in addition to requiring prenatal care and confinement with
childbirth. Therefore, they present more
frequent opportunities for sampling than
do males. The excess of females (sex ratio
of 78 relative to population estimate of
101) is thus not remarkable. Age variation
in the sample is consistent with the sampling method employed.

Social Biology

Linkage of genealogical data resulted in
the construction of family units. The agesex composition of the resident and emigrant subpopulations was derived through
enumeration of each individual therein,
by year of birth, sex, alive or deceased,
and usual residence.

A total of 6,191 individuals of Indian ancestry, ranging from 8/8 to less than 1/8,
were enumerated. Among these, 4,316 were
alive in 1968. Living Ojibwa included 651
emigrants (296 male and 355 female, sex
ratio around 83). Records and informants
were concordant with the designation of
these individuals as “probable” permanent
emigrants. Seasonal emigrants, with usual
residence within the sampling area, have
been eumerated with the resident population. The population of “resident” Indians
included 3,665 individuals.

The “best” census estimate of the resident population on January 1, 1968 included 4,724 individuals (Thistle et al.,
1971). Comparison of that population with
our sample is presented in Table 2. The
sample size suggests 77% enumeration of
the population. However, several contrasts
between the census and sample are noteworthy. Our sample overenumerates males
between the ages of 30-39 and females in
each of the ten-year increments between
the ages of 30-59. If we assume that the
female excess has also contributed offspring
to the 0-9 sample age-cohort, it follows
that numerous compositional differences
must emerge from comparisons of the census and sample populations.

The discrepancies between the two estimates of the population have resulted as
a consequence of the dissimilar criteria
utilized in the definition of sampling units.

tion. Our definition emphasized Indian ancestry and genealogical relationship. We
have attempted to elicit, from knowledgable informants, estimates of the total
population within the area based upon our
criteria. These have ranged from six to
eight thousand individuals. Therefore, our
sample ranges between 133% of the BIA
population of 2,795 for 1970 (LWVM,
1971), 77% of the 1968 census population,
and between 43% and 61% of the estimated population. Our experience suggests
that the local estimates present a credible
range. Our sample, that of the BIA and
the census of Thistle et al. (1971) must
therefore be viewed as three samples, defined on different criteria and drawn from
the same geographic population.

We are unaware of a methodology by
which a prospective restrictive definition
of reservation populations can be effected,
except through stratification of a larger
population unit (see also Hackenberg,
1967). This would require an estimate of
the total regional population. Comparison
of our sample with the BIA and DIH censuses suggests problems of magnitude in
North American Indian population research. Stratification of our sample on the
criteria utilized by the various agencies
involved in Indian affairs indicates signifi
cant effects upon estimates of the parameters of demographic structure. These observations will be reported in a subsequent
publication.

Individuals of Ojibwa Indian ancestry
predominated in the total sample. One or
more Blackfoot, Navajo, Iroquois, Klamath, Cherokee, Ottawa, Sioux, Yuma, and
Mexican individuals were also enumerated
as either an immigrant father or mother.
Non-Indians included 192 Euro-Americans
and two Afro-Americans.

PRELIMINARY ANALYSES: INDEX CASES

Primary index cases were drawn from
the population in accordance with the
research strategy. Demographic characterization of the sample of index cases
documents: (1) the base from which
demographic reconstruction was initiated;
and (2) the genetic sample.

Cross-tabulation of ancestry, residence,
and band affiliation of primary index cases
by sex, with a chi-square test for homogeneity between the sexes, was performed.
The null hypothesis was accepted for ancestry (y? == 7.58, with 8df; at 0.05 level
a == 15.51) and residence (y? = 13.32,
with 11df; at 0.05 level a = 19.68) and
rejected for band affiliation (y? = 15.37,
with 7df; at 0.05 level a = 14.07). Lack

of homogeneity for band affiliation resulted from pronounced inversion of the
sex ratio of the immigrant class relative to
that of the resident bands and unknown
class (50:87).

Ancestry, residence, and band affiliation
were cross-tabulated and tested with chisquare for independence. Each of the three
cross-tabulations resulted in significant
values of chi-square.*

Direction and intensity of associations
between band affiliation and residence and
band affiliation and ancestry were investigated by correlation analysis. Dichotomized
distributions were established through assignment of a score of (1) for within class
and (0) for not within class to each index
case. Each band was analyzed for correlation with each band-equivalent region. In
the inclusive analysis of a specific region,
the communities of region B were scored
(1), i.e., were included within the region.

(0) for each region. Immigrants were investigated for internal variation in region
of residence by distinguishing those from
Red Lake (1) from others (0). Immigrants from White Earth Reservation predominated among the second class.
Ancestry of 5/8 to 8/8 Indian (1),
relative to 1/8 to 4/8 (0), was investigated
by peripheral (1) and online (0) communities and by band-equivalent regions.
Correlation analysis, following Li (1961)
was performed on each of the dichotomousbivariate tables. The results are presented
in Table 3. Significant positive correlations
for residence within congruent bandequivalent regions were observed. Exclusion of region B resulted in an increase in
correlation of band affiliation and _ residence for the Cass-Winnibigoshish and
White Oak Point bands. This observation
supports the hypothesis that region B communities have drawn residents from each

of the band-equivalent regions. Positive
correlations of Cass-Winnibigoshish band
with region II and, conversely, the White
Oak Point band with region I resulted
from the method elected for inclusionexclusion of Inger-Bowstring Lake in the
analysis. Correlation of Leech Lake Pillager band with regions III plus B and

III, were positive, significant, and equivalent. Subsequent to analysis, we found
that a satellite community of Leech Lake
Pillager affinity had universally claimed
residence in Cass Lake. This effected a
reduction in the correlation coefficient for
residence in region III when the B-group
communities were removed. The coefficient
for region III plus B was not so affected.
We conclude that distinction of region B
from regions I-III will provide a basis for
meaningful comparisons in future analyses.

Immigrants to the area exhibited a
positive correlation with region B, ie.,
the communities of Cass Lake and Bena,
relative to the total nonimmigrant population. Internal analysis of the immigrant
class indicated that Red Lake immigrants
were negatively correlated with region B.
Correlation of Red Lake immigrants was
positive with each of regions I and II and
negative with region III; Genealogies from
Inger-Bowstring Lake indicated that Red
Lake immigrants to that community were
spouses of Cass-Winnibigoshish band members. The correlation of Red Lake with
region II is inflated by inclusion of the
community in analysis and is a function of
the strong correlation, through marriage,
with region I.

Immigrants other than those from Red
Lake are positively correlated with region
B. Those not resident in region B, exhibit
strong positive correlation with region III
and negative correlation with regions I
and II. The majority (84%) of non-Red
immigrants have migrated from the White
Earth Reservation. Among these, members
of the Otter Tail Pillager band (39%)
have predominated. Consideration of band
composition, size, and sex ratio for the
White Earth Reservation in 1900 has suggested that Otter Tail band affiliants are
the least probable immigrants to Leech
Lake Reservation (Rokala, 1971). Hickerson (1962) has documented this band as

an early fission population from the Leech
Lake Pillager. Their predominance at
Leech Lake may represent an attraction
through persistent ties of kinship with the
Leech Lake Pillager of region ITI.

Significant positive correlations of ancestry greater than one-half Indian have
been derived for the aggregate of regions
I-III, i.e., peripheral reservation communities. Significant, negative correlation has
been observed with “online” communities.
These results suggest greater concentration
of admixture in the “online” region, with
relatively less in the peripheral communities.

CONCLUSIONS

Two processes, migration and admixture, are significant determinants of the
demographic structure of the Leech Lake
Reservation. Their associations with kinship and effects upon kinship and consanguinity in reservation communities are
currently under investigation.

Migration can be reduced to three principal components: (1) internal reorganization; (2) immigration of non-Leech
Lake Ojibwa to the reservation; and (3)
emigration.

Internal reorganization exhibits three
(1) random migration within
restricted neighborhoods which correspond,
approximately, to band-equivalent regions;
(2) systematic migration from  bandequivalent regions to “online” communities; and (3) infrequent migration from
“online” communities to the periphery of
regions I-III. Indian migration to the
reservation is nonrandom by residence and
by origin. Immigrants from the Red Lake
Reservation reside within band-equivalent
regions I and II. Other Indian immigrants
reside in regions III and the online communities of Cass Lake and Bena. Work
in progress suggests that emigration from

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

436

the reservation occurs primarily from the
“online” communities.

The net effect of migration on the reservation communities include a damping of
population growth in the peripheral communities. Mortality in these communities
remains a potent force in determining the
demographic structure. In the absence of
significant immigration, the peripheral
communities may undergo negative growth.
The direct effects of emigration and the
indirect effects on natural increase will
accentuate the rate of population aging
and decline in size.

Emigrants from regions I and II may
be effectively replaced by immigrants
from the Red Lake Reservation, and region III may be stabilized by White Earth
immigrants. However, it is probable that
replacement will not occur and that the
rate of decline in population size and the
process of population aging will only be
slowed. Indian immigrants from off-reservation and from peripheral reservation
communities should produce an increase
in the size of the online communities.
However, the rate of increase will also be
affected by the rate of emigration from the
online population to off-reservation residences and by the age distribution of the
emigrants. At the present time, it is probable that a negative net migration rate,
with emigrants concentrated in the reproductive age groups, is producing negative
population growth in the online communities.

Indian ancestry is greater among the
populations of the peripheral communities
of regions I-III. Online communities exhibit proportionately less Indian ancestry.
The relative proportions of ancestry in all
regions are affected by migration. We suggest that admixture with non-Indians occurs, primarily, in the online communities.
That which occurs within the periphery,
through marriage, results in migration to

the online communities. Admixture in online communities is associated with the
open structure of the reservation and the
non-Indian concentration therein. Emigration from the reservation occurs from the
online communities and is associated with
lesser Indian ancestry and/or marriage to
non-Indians. The result of systematic emigration, associated with ancestry, should
be to raise the proportion of Indian ancestry in the online, as well as the peripheral communities. Conversely, the urban
population of emigrants from Leech
Lake should exhibit relatively greater degrees of admixture.

The Greater Leech Lake Reservation
exhibits structural features and patterns
of admixture similar to those reported for
the Nez Perce Reservation (Walker, 1967).
Superficial similarities to the Papago Reservation and population (Hackenberg,
1972; Hackenberg and Wilson, 1972) are
evident in the patterns of migration. Major
differences may be expected to result from
the, respectively, open and closed reservation systems. Workman and Niswander
(1970) have reported internal genetic
differentiation of the Papago Reservation
communities. The Leech Lake patterns of
differential immigration, emigration, and

admixture may result in further under
standing of the processes by which open
and closed reservation systems effect internal genetic differentiation of reservation
populations.
