Fertility and Longevity in Twins, Sibs, and

Parents of Twins

ABSTRACT: Genealogical records containing birth and death dates for completed families have
been analyzed to compare the longevity of twins, sibs and parents. The data are restricted to
twins and sibs who survived to adulthood and married. The findings, similar to those found with
respect to fertility (Wyshak and White, 1969), show that twins, especially male twins, are
disadvantaged in comparison with their male sibs. Sib-sib and parent-offspring correlation
analysis confirmed that there is a genetic component in the determination of life span, but
environmental factors contribute more to the total variation. No evidence of a stronger maternal
than paternal effect was found. Twin bearers also lived longer than nontwin bearers. Even
among persons who survived to age 50 or more, parents of twins had more children and lived
slightly longer than their twin and nontwin offspring. Regression analysis for persons who
survived to 50 or longer indicated that, in addition to life span of parents, secularity (year of
death) and fertility (number of children borne) were the best predictors of longevity, though only a
small proportion of the variation could be accounted for by these and other demographic
variables. Life span has shown a consistent increase over time from the seventeenth century
through the nineteenth century, while fertility has tended to decline. However, among persons
surviving to age 50, when the relation between secularity and fertility and secularity and
longevity is controlled, a significant correlation between fertility and longevity remains. This
relation, observed in populations that did not practice voluntary family size limitation, would not
be found in contemporary data. Maternal mortality accounted for the shorter life span of women
than for men; eliminating its effect gives women a slight advantage. The fertility and longevity
experience of migrants who survived to age 50 is more favorable than that of persons who did not
migrate.

Longevity and the role of heredity in the
determination of the life span have long
been of interest to scientists. Currently, a
group from Johns Hopkins University has
been following up the work of the Pearls
which was started in the 1920’s. The publications of the Hopkins group provide an
extensive review of the research in the
area of longevity and the human life span
(B. H. Cohen, 1964; Hawkins et al.,
1965); Abbott et al., 1974). J. E. Cohen
(1975) has recently demonstrated an interest in longevity by reanalyzing data on
childhood mortality in pre-industrial
Europe. Jalavisto (1951) has studied the
inheritance of longevity using data from
various published genealogies of the Fin
nish and Swedish nobility and middleclass. Philippe and Yelle (1976), in the
course of work on an isolated FrenchCanadian population, have examined the
effect of family size on mother’s longevity.
Kallmann and his coworkers have over
several decades been investigating twin
pairs with respect to their biological and
psychological characteristics in relation to
heredity and longevity (Kallmann and
Sander, 1948, 1949; Kallmann et al., 1955;
Falek et al., 1960; Jarvis et al., 1960).
A number of investigators have found a
genetically determined relationship between parental life span and life span of
offspring (the Hopkins group, Jalavisto,
Kallmann and coworkers). Of special

interest are the findings of the Hopkins
group and Jalavisto, both of whom report
a stronger maternal effect and a paternal
effect, the former suggesting that the
stronger influence of maternal age at death
on offspring’s age at death is consistent
with cytoplasmic inheritance or with
X-linkage. Kallmann and his coworkers,
cited above, in their work with twins and
their sibs did not find a difference between
maternal and paternal effects.

Our investigation into longevity results
from a more general interest in the records
of the Genealogical Society of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or
Mormon Church, at Salt Lake City, Utah.
In the course of our work on the inheritance of human twinning, we have collected data on completed families containing at least one set of twins. (Wyshak and
White, 1969). The records of the Society
are complete with respect to birth dates
and death dates and thereby have certain
advantages over the data of the Hopkins
group and over J. Cohen’s data which only
cover childhood mortality.

The data to be analyzed and discussed
below come from the Archives of the
Genealogical Society of the Mormon
Church. The Genealogical Society is
probably the largest repository of
genealogical records in the world (Gardner
et al., 1958). The Mormon Church was
established around 1830. The Archives
contain the records of ancestors of Mormons as well as of present-day Mormons.
Part of the mission of every member of the
Mormon Church is to trace back his or her
genealogy as far as possible in an attempt
to form a chain going back to Adam and
Eve. The data stored in the Archives of
the Society have been made available to us
for research purposes since 1963 (Wyshak
and White, 1965).

The portion of the genealogical records
that we have used for our work is the
Family Record Sheet, which is the unit

Wyshak

Social Biology

record of a single completed family consisting of husband, wife, and issue. Dates
and places of birth, death, and marriage
are recorded for husband, wife, and each
child. Children are listed by sex and order
of birth. The source of information, the
person submitting it, and its verification
are also recorded. In addition, data of religious significance are found on the family
record sheet.

Interest in these records grew out of our
research on the inheritance of twinning
(Wyshak and White, 1965) and on the fertility of twins and the parents of twins
(Wyshak and White, 1969). For these purposes, the entire collection of the Family
Record Sheets—approximately four million records—on file at the Society were
scanned. The focus of the search was on
sibships containing at least one set of twins
wherein at least one member of the set of
twins could be followed up with respect to
his or her own marriage and his or her
own appearance in the Family Record
Sheets as husband or wife of a family. The
organization of the records is such that an
asterisk by the name of an individual signifies that he appears elsewhere in the
records as the head of a family. That is, a
family record sheet is on file for him,
recording data about his birth, death, and
marriage, and also similar information
about his spouse and his offspring.

The scanning process was carried out
systematically by investigating every record on file. The Family Record Sheets are
filed in the Archives alphabetically and are
bound in ledgers of approximately two to
three hundred sheets. The process of
scanning, which was laborious and which
covered a period of several years, enabled
us to collect data on some 9,719 families,
which have been termed “Index Families.”” The Index Families are families that
contain at least one set of twins, at least
one of whom appeared elsewhere in the
Archives as head of a family. That they

 

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

Vol. 25, No. 4

appeared elsewhere is signified by an asterisk and, of course, implies that they
survived to adulthood and married. Data
on the offspring of the 9,719 Index Families yielded information on 29,967 asterisked persons (persons who appeared as
parents elsewhere in the records). Of
these, 11,921 were twins and 17,688 were
the sibs of twins.

The Family Record Sheet records dates
of birth and death for husband, wife, and
children and includes dates for children
whether or not the name bears an asterisk.
Names without asterisks are of persons
who may have died in infancy or childhood, or who may not have married, or
about whom information about marriage
does not exist. The availability of information on birth and death leads to the present
study where the longevity or life span of
the following groups is analyzed: (1) parents of twins—husbands and wives of
Index Families; (2) twins and sibs of twins
who survived to adulthood and married
(asterisked persons); and (3) twins and sibs
of twins whose birth and death dates indicate that they died before reaching a marriageable age, and twins and sibs whose
dates of birth and death are recorded but
no record of their marriage is on file in the
Archives (nonasterisked persons).

An earlier work (Wyshak and White,
1969) enabled us to examine the fertility of
parents of twins and the fertility of twins
and their sibs as one measure of fitness. In
the present analysis, we shall consider
longevity, and its relation to fertility,
thereby investigating the overall fitness of
twins in comparison with their parents
and with their sibs. The high mortality of
twins during infancy and early childhood
is well known (Bulmer, 1970, for example)
and will not be considered in the present
study; rather, the analysis will focus on
data of asterisked twins and asterisked
sibs of twins. Unfortunately, the data at
hand, the Family Record Sheets, contain

Fertility and Longevity

317

no information relating to cause of death,
or to environmental factors such as
epidemics of infectious diseases, or to socloeconomic factors—occupation, culture,
life style. However, factors such as sex,
birth order, twin or sib status, place of
birth, and secularity can be considered in
the study of the interrelationship between
fertility and longevity. These data permit
the examination of the relationships between fertility and longevity and other
demographic factors in human populations who do not practice voluntary birth
control. The main concern of the paper
will be the comparisons of sibs (some of
whom are twins) and parents and offspring.

It should be pointed out that the data
collected do not represent a random sample from some defined universe. At the
time of our search, the entire population
of families on file at the Archives of
the Genealogical Society was searched.
Included for study are those families
which contain at least one set of twins at
least one of whom survived to adulthood,
married, and appeared in the Archives as
the head of a family. The validity of
genealogical data is often open to question. Our own experience and that of others suggest that the accuracy and reliability of the Mormon Church’s records compare favorably with other data sources.
Although hidden biases may exist, our
analyses relating to the inheritance of
twinning did not reveal any such biases.
Moreover, the analysis will be primarily
directed toward comparisons of subgroups
within the data set. There is no reason to
believe that if bias exists, is is likely to
occur in one subgroup rather than in another.

death dates, from which longevity or life
span was determined as the difference between date of death and date of birth, are
recorded on the Family Record Sheets of
the Index Families for husband, wife, and
offspring. Dates on both birth and death
were recorded for about 60 per cent of the
asterisked offspring (those who survived
to adulthood, married, and appeared as
heads of families in the Family Record
Sheets). Information was less likely to be
recorded for females than for males, probably because of difficulty in tracing
women due to name change following
marriage. The proportion of women who
are asterisked is also less than that of men,
for the same reason. The analysis of fertility did not, however, reveal any bias due
to the smaller proportion of women about
whom information was available (Wyshak
and White, 1969). In the present analysis
of longevity, there is no reason to believe
that women about whom information is
not recorded differ from those whose
records have been traced. In addition, the
main focus of the analyses will be based on
comparisons, thus eliminating problems
that may relate to representativeness (in
the statistical sense) of the data.

It was stated earlier that the analyses
are based on birth and death dates. The
question of truncation at the end of life
could arise, but all persons included were
born at periods sufficiently prior to the
time of data collection that there is no

possibility that death dates were not
recorded because persons were still alive.
Lack of information on date of death
would occur only because of the unavailability, unreliability, or inadequacy of the
sources of the genealogical data. In order
for records to be filed in the Archives of
the Mormon Church, they are checked
and verified; only those items of information considered accurate and reliable are
recorded. To ensure that there is no possibility of truncation, subsequent analyses
will be based on twins and sibs born before 1850.

RESULTS

PARENT-OFFSPRING AND SIB-SIB
CORRELATIONS

With the data at hand, valid comparisons can be made among various
subgroups—husband-wife, parent-child,
twin-twin, twin-sib, and sib-sib. Such
comparisons can be used to assess the role
of heredity in the determination of the life
span and to compare the fitness of twins
with that of their parents and that of their
nontwin sibs. In the genetic context, life
span, or longevity, is a continuously
graded attribute. From an examination of
the intercorrelations among the groups
cited above, it is possible to attempt to
separate genetic and environmental factors in the determination of the life span.
In a random-mating population, the corre

lations between individuals of given genetic relationship with respect to a quantitative character can be expressed in
terms of V,, the additive genetic variance;
V p, dominance variance; and Vz, the environmental variance (Cavalli-Sforza and
Bodmer, 1971). The following formula
can be used:

As noted, the Family Record Sheets
which contain the data indicate the sex of
twins, their birth order, and dates of birth
and death. There is no information on the
basis of which zygosity determinations can
be made. While unlike-sexed twins are
always dizygotic twins, like-sexed twins
can be either monozygotic or dizygotic
twins. For this reason, the usual twin
method for the measurement of the degree
of genetic determination of a continuously
graded character based on a comparison

319

of the variance of differences between
monozygotic twin pairs and the differences between dizygotic twin pairs is not
applicable to these data.

Table 2 shows the correlation coefficients of the life spans for twins and sibs,
and for twins and sibs with fathers and
mothers. As noted above, the persons
under consideration are those who survived to a marriageable age, married, and
whose records appear in the Archives of
the Mormon Church. By comparing persons within a sibship and parents with
children, we are largely controlling for en

vironmental, cultural, and social factors.
By restricting the analysis to persons who
married at least once, we are eliminating
factors associated with childhood and
early adult mortality. Because data are
based on genealogical records which
include birth and death dates for all individuals in the study, comparisons between
the life span or longevity of the various
groups can be made. The life table approach commonly used for studies of
longevity and life expectancy, where the
assumption is that not all members of a
given cohort have died, are not useful for
these data.

From Table 2, it is evident that statistically significant correlations in the life
span of sibs, parent-offspring, and
husband-wife exist. Sibs of the same sex
have higher correlations than do persons
of opposite sex; the range in correlation
coefficients for same-sexed sibs is 0.125 to
0.240. The highest correlation observed is
between female co-twins. (As noted above,
zygosity determinations cannot be made
for the twins recorded in the data, the
Family Record Sheets. Like-sexed twins
are a mixture of monozygotic and dizygotic twins; unlike-sexed twins are necessarily dizygotic.) Among male sibs, males of
MM twins pairs have the highest correlation. Interestingly, the lowest correlation
is that between male-female cotwins,
being 0.044. Based on 292 pairs, it is the
only value in the table which is not statistically significant at the 5 per cent level.
Correlations between parent and offspring
tend to be lower than between sibs, but
are significant for all parent-offspring
combinations in the table, ranging from
0.059 to 0.116. The correlation between
husband and wife is relatively high, 0.127,
in the same range as the correlation between same-sexed sibs.

Using the standard statistical method
for testing the hypothesis that several r’s
are from the same p, and for combining

Wyshak

Social Biology

them into an estimate of p, we found
that r’s for same-sexed sibs and for the
various parent-offspring combinations are
not different and can be combined. For
same-sexed sibs, the combined average r is
0.127; the combined average r for parentoffspring is 0.075. If all sib-sib combinations, 14 separate correlations, were averaged, the r would be 0.112; a test showed
them to be heterogeneous at the 1 per cent
level. The six separate correlations of
oOpposite-sexed sibs also show heterogeneity, p = 0.005; but if they were combined, the average r would be 0.086. The
average r for male combinations p =
0.121; for female combinations, 0.150.
Though the female-female correlations
appear higher, the difference is not significant. (The method of testing the equality of p’s and the method of combining
them, using Fisher’s Z transformation, are
discussed in Snedecor and Cochran, 1967).
The 7’s were not found to be different
and were combined in the following
groups with the resulting average 7’s:

Father-offspring ....... r = 0.0747
Father-male offspring ... 7 = 0.0758
Father-female offspring r = 0.0728
Mother-offspring ....... r = 0.0759
Mother-male offspring .. r = 0.0785

Mother-female offspring r = 0.0713

Jalavisto (1951) reported that both maternal and paternal longevity tends to increase the mean length of life of the offspring; that the effect of maternal longevity exceeds that of paternal longevity; and
that the paternal effect is greater in sons
than in daughters. Abbott et al. (1974) also
observed that the trend for survival is
somewhat more marked in relationship to
the mother’s age at death than to the
father’s, and for both groups it is more
striking for males than for females. They
further state that the former is consistent
with cytoplasmic inheritance, or with
X-linkage (multiple loci presumably being

Vol. 25, No. 4

involved) which if recessive would account for greater similarity between
mother and son than between mother and
daughter. They do caution, however, that
no very secure conclusions are possible
from their analysis. On the other hand,
Kallmann et al. (1955) found that the effects of the ages of fathers and mothers on
the life spans of some offspring are virtually the same, while the life-span effect
of middle-aged mothers (55-69) on their
daughters is less pronounced. They comment that the apparent lack of agreement
between their data and those of Jalavisto
(1951) is probably explained by life expectancy differences between the two samples. Our results agree with those of
Kallmann and his coworkers (1955) that
there is no evidence that correlations between the life span of mother-offspring are
higher than those for father-offspring.
Using the average 7’s as obtained from
various sib-sib combinations and parentoffspring combinations, the formulas
given above can be used to estimate the
components of the variance. Thus, we
have:
Average fpo = 0.075
Average 7,, = 0.112, all sibs (1)
Average rs, = 0.127, same sex sibs (2)
Average 7;,; = 0.086, opposite sex sibs (3)
Using the three estimates for the correlation between sibs, estimates of

Between 64 and 81 per cent of the total
variance seems to be environmental. The
dominance variance constitutes between
23 and 58 per cent of the total genetic
variance. The high environmental value is
not surprising since one might expect that
environmental correlations between sibs
may be stronger than those between parents and offspring. The environmental effect within the same generation is supported by the finding that the correlation
between the life spans of husbands and
wives, that is, the parents of the offspring,
is 0.127, based on 5,457 pairs where birth
and death dates are known.

INTRAPAIR COMPARISONS

Although the primary purpose of this
paper is to examine and compare longevity
of twins with that of their sibs and their
parents, comparisons of twin pairs can
also be made. However, relatively few
pairs, both members of which survived to
adulthood and married and for whom birth
and death data were recorded on Family
Record Sheets, are available for comparison. Table 3 presents the differences in life
span of co-twins by twin type.

None of the differences between co-twins
differ significantly from zero, supporting
Kallmann and Sander’s observation (1948)
that twins tend to die within three to five
years of each other. As shown in Table 2,
the correlations in life spans of like-sexed
twins (most of whom are co-twins) are
slightly higher than the correlations between sib and twins of the same sex.

COMPARISONS OF THE LONGEVITY OF TWINS
AND THEIR SIBS AND THEIR PARENTS

In this section, comparisons of the various subgroups will be made and multiple
regression done to determine what factors
can be used to predict life span. Most of
the families in the Archives are from
the United States or Northern Europe;
the time period is predominantly the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As
noted above, to ensure that only persons
who could not possibly still be alive are
considered, the analyses will include only
twins and sibs born before 1850.

Overall comparisons show that twins,
both MM twins and males from MF pairs,
are disadvantaged over their brothers, but
female twins are not (Table 4). This is
consistent with our findings with respect
to fertility where it was found that male
twins are less fertile than their male sibs
(have fewer children), but there were no
differences between female twins and female sibs of twins (Wyshak and White,
1969). Even when we compare twins and
sibs who survived to age 50 or longer, the
disadvantage of twins remains. Thus, the
view that twins are generally not as longlived as singly born persons (Whittinghill,
1965) and that they are less fertile holds
true. While the differences are not great,

Wyshak

 

Social Biology

they are statistically significant for males.
Remembering that we have restricted
comparison to twins and sibs who survived the risk of death during the
perinatal period and childhood and were
healthy enough to marry and to survive to
age 50, the difference of one year is significant beyond a statistical finding. Why
males should be disadvantaged while females are not is a question that these data
cannot answer. It has been speculated
(Gifford, unpublished) that “individual differentiation, as an interaction between inherited developmental schedules and the
vicissitudes of experience, begins even earlier in intrauterine life, and that the effects
of early experience may be as permanent
as if they are genetically determined.”

When the fertility of twins was compared with that of their parents, it was
found that the parents were more fertile
(produced more children) (Wyshak and
White, 1969). Similarly, parents of twins
have a considerably longer life span—an
advantage of three to four years over their
offspring, both twin and nontwin. The
fathers of twins and sibs lived an average
of 67.4 years; the mothers, 65.5 years (Table 4).

The important difference between the
parents and offspring is the fact that to be

included in the study, parents had to have
at least one set of twins; offspring needed
to survive to adulthood and to marry, and
they may or may not have had children.
Table 5 shows that the bearing of children, and especially the bearing of twins,
is associated with a longer life span, even
among those who survived to age 50 or
longer. Thus, it appears that twin bearing
is related not only to fertility but to longevity. A comparison of the parents with their
twin and nontwin offspring, taking into
account offspring who themselves had
twins, shows that the greater fertility of
parents largely disappears (Table 6).
Though in the subgroups by twin or sib
type, the differences do not depart from
zero, MF twins (both the males and the
females) who had twins among their offspring tended to have more children than
their parents; for singletons and like-sexed
twins, the parents tended to have more
children than their offspring.

Differences in life span between parents
and offspring also diminish considerably
when those who survived to age 50 or
longer and who also had twin offspring are
considered (Table 7). The conclusion that
remains is that among persons who survive beyond the childbearing age, age 50,
fertility or the number of children
produced tends to increase life span.

From the regression analyses which
included only persons who survived to age
50 or longer, the most significant environmental factor affecting longevity is
secularity. Regression was done using a
stepwise procedure using the Data-text
Program (Armor and Couch, 1972). The
effect of secularity is not surprising, but it
predates the advances in medical science
which occurred during the twentieth century. Our findings are in agreement with
those of McKeown and Brown (1955) who
discussed changes in the English population in the eighteenth century in some de

tail. After considering three possible
causes of a reduction of mortality from
infectious disease (specified medical
therapy, changes in the balance between
the virulence of the infective organism and
its host, and improvements in the environment), they conclude that improvement in the environment (measures such
as improvement in housing, water supply,
or refuse disposal; improvements in nutrition, improvements in economic and social
conditions, etc.) are the most acceptable
explanations of the decline of mortality in
the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In addition to secularity (year of death),
life span of parents and number of offspring contribute to the regression equation; but the total proportion of the variance explained (R2) is small, though statistically significant, ranging from 8 to 11 per
cent (Table 8). If year of birth is included
rather than year of death, it makes virtually no contribution, though the correlation between year of death and year of
birth is 0.98. In Table 9 where year of
birth is included as a possible contributor,

it does not enter the equation and the R2’s
decrease, ranging between 1 per cent and
5 per cent. Birth order, believed to be
relevant (Cohen, 1975), and mother’s age
at birth, believed to be a favorable element in longevity (Ostfeld, 1975, p. 4),
made no impact in our analyses.

What remains are two main findings: (1)
the confirmation of the genetic component, that is, the relation between life span
of parents and offspring, and (2) the relation between fertility and longevity. The
first point needs no further discussion. The
relation between fertility and longevity
does. Current demographic data would
undoubtedly show a negative relation between these two factors, perhaps because
of confounding with social class. Persons
with small numbers of children, usually
persons of higher socioeconomic status (at
least in developed countries such as the
United States and Northern Europe)
would have more favorable life styles and
tend to live longer. In our data, which
precedes the era of voluntary limitation of
family size, we are able to examine the
relation between the two important biolog

MATERNAL DEATH

In the comparison groups considered in
the preceding discussion, the life span of
males exceeded that of females—a sharp
contrast from current demographic
findings where the life spans of women
exceed those of males by several years.
(Table 4). Until well into the twentieth
century, women were at high risk of death
due to childbearing. (The records available have no indication of cause of death.)
For present purposes, a “maternal death”
was any death among women which occurred within one year of the birth of the

last child. The data were coded by year
(months being disregarded). Thus, if the
year of the mother’s death minus the year
of birth of the last child was less than or
equal to one, the woman’s death was
classified a “maternal death.” While recognizing that this rule may yield some
false positives (deaths attributed to
childbearing which in fact were due to
other causes), we classed as “maternal
deaths” 528 or 10 percent of the 5,130 female twins and female sibs born before
1850 and who had at least one child. The
male advantage over females largely
disappears when those whose deaths may
have been due to childbearing are eliminated from the comparison (Tables 11 and
12). Comparisons of persons who survived
to age 50 eliminate the advantage of males
over females. The sex differences are far
less, however, than those based on
present-day life table values of expectation
of life among U.S. whites.

For 1971, the expectation of life at ages
30 for white males was 41.3 for white
females, 47.7 (Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, 1974, Table 7).
Expectation of life at ages 30~31 are selected for comparison since the data analyzed relate only to persons who survived
to adulthood and married. Thus, persons
in the present era who live to age 30 have
about a seven year advantage, if they are

Vol. 25, No. 4

men, over men of the nineteenth century
and earlier times; a fifteen year advantage
if they are women. Whether women will
undergo stress as they take on dual or
multiple roles in today’s society and
whether the effects of the stress will be
reflected in a decrease in their life expectancy is a matter for further study.

MIGRATION

Epidemiologists have for some time
been interested in so-called “migrant”
studies in which comparisons are made
between members of ethnic or national
groups who migrate (live in another country and culture) and those who remain in
the place of origin. MacMahon and Pugh
(1970, p. 175ff) discuss the problems associated with migrant studies, but point out
that such studies have been of value.

We examined our genealogical data,
comparing the longevity and fertility of
persons who migrated and those who did
not. Migration was determined by identifying families where the birthplace of the
father differed from that of the offspring.
If a difference was found, the family was
classified as having migrated. Though this
method of classification may lead to some
error, it is more likely to underestimate
migration since migration could occur
after the family was completed. A possibility of overestimation could arise if families
spent some time away from the country of
origin, during which period children were
born, and then returned to the country of
origin. Despite the limitations of the
method used, we chose to analyze the
longevity and fertility experience of persons belonging to families classified as
migrants and compare them with families
classified as nonmigrants. Among the
13,288 individual twins and sibs of twins
born before 1850 and who survived to age
50, 515 are from families where the country of birth of the father differed from that
of his offspring.

Fertility and Longevity

327

In most cases, the migration was from a
European country to the United States. In
general, it appears that migrants are more
fit than nonmigrants. Parents who migrated tended to have more children than
parents of nonmigrants and also migrant
parents tended to live longer (see Table
13). The more valid data for parents are
those relating to parents of twins for the
reason that the parents’ experience is
included with data on each of his offspring
about whom data is available. Information about parents of large families will
tend to be entered several times. Since
most families had just over one twin,
where data were available (asterisked
twins), relating the parents’ experience to
that of their twin offspring will diminish
the overcounting of parents and is the
more appropriate figure. Offspring of migrants also tend to produce more children
and to live longer than persons from sibships where the family did not migrate.

DISCUSSION

In a previous paper the fertility of twins
was compared with that of their sibs and
that of their parents (Wyshak and White,
1969). Twins were found to have fewer
children than their sibs and fewer than
their parents. The difference in the number of children born to twins and sibs,
which we believe to be a real one, can
perhaps be accounted for because twins
tend to be born to older mothers, have a
less favorable uterine environment, or are
smaller and less well developed at birth.
The question of the relation between fertility has also been raised. We undertook an
examination of genealogical data to investigate this question and to compare the life
span of twins with that of their sibs and of
their parents. Twins and sibs who survived to adulthood and married and about
whom dates of birth and death were
known are included for study. As in the

fertility comparisons, longevity is shorter
among male twins than for their male sibs;
differences between female twins and their
female sibs tend to be negligible. Thus,
based on genealogical data, we found that
the fitness of twins—fertility (number of
children produced) and longevity—is less
than that of their singleton sibs. Twin
bearers and the husbands of twin-bearers
have both a fertility advantage and a
longevity advantage over nontwin bearers.

Overall, parents of twins tend to be
more fertile than their twin and nontwin
offspring; they are also longer lived.
However, when comparisons are restricted to persons who survived to age 50
or longer and to those who themselves had
twin offspring, the parental advantages
diminish considerably. Parents had about
six-tenths of a child more, on the average.
The life span advantage was slightly
greater for fathers over sons; but
daughters outlived their mothers by a
short time. Because of the secular increase

in life span, the offspring might be expected to have a greater advantage. The
finding that offspring do not “do better”
than their parents could possibly be explained by regression toward the mean.

Unquestionably, genetic factors play a
role in the determination of life span; but
environmental factors, not surprisingly,
contribute more to the total variation, as
found from the analysis of sib-sib and
parent-offspring correlations. No evidence
of a greater influence of maternal life span
over paternal life span on offspring’s life
span was found, contrary to the findings of
Jalavisto (1951) and those of Abbott et al.
(1974) who concluded that this is consistent with cytoplasmic inheritance or with
X-linkage.

The single most important factor in
predicting longevity for persons who survived to age 50 is secularity. Over the
period between the seventeenth and
nineteenth centuries, there has been a consistent increase in the life span. This increase was observed for persons in the

United States, England and Wales, and
Northern Europe. Contemporary demographic analyses have shown that life span
has continued to increase throughout the
twentieth century. Much of the increase
has been attributed to a general improvement in environmental conditions.

Fertility (number of children borne)
showed a significant correlation with
longevity. Obviously, one needs to live
longer to produce children. However,
when longevity of persons who survived
beyond the reproductive age (age 50) is
considered, fertility still emerges as a relatively important variable. But only a relatively small proportion of the variation
could be explained by the variables included. R2, though small, is statistically
significant, ranging from 8 per cent to 11
per cent.

The important finding is the significant
relation of fertility and longevity. Such a
relation is not found in contemporary
demographic data for developed countries
such as the United States and Northern
Europe because of the voluntary limitation of family size which is widely practiced; small family size, usually correlated
with higher socioeconomic status, tends to
also be correlated with good health,
well-being, and life span. The data of this
study, based on historical demographic

records, enable us to examine the relation
between fertility and longevity in human
populations which did not limit family size
voluntarily. A well-known demographic
trend is the general decline in family size
over the past two or three centuries; our
data reflect this decrease in fertility in the
United States and Northern Europe.
There was a marked negative correlation
between fertility (number of children
borne) and secularity (year of death). This
finding does not, however, negate the observed relation between fertility and
longevity, for when the effect of secularity
is accounted for by partial correlation, the
correlation between fertility and longevity
is strengthened.

Energy, health, and fitness are also
reflected in the experience of “migrants,”
here defined as those families where the
country of birth of the father differed from
that of offspring. Based on an analysis of
parents and offspring who survived beyond the reproductive age (50 years), we
observe that “migrants” tend to have more
children and to live longer than nonmigrants.
