The effects of genetic differences among
siblings or dizygotic (DZ) twins are seldom
studied. Although sibs share half of their
genes on the average, the actual percentage
of genes identical by descent varies around
the mean of 50.

As two studies (Pakstis et al., 1972;
Loehlin et al., 1974) have indicated, blood
group markers may be useful as a rough
index of the degree of genetic similarity
between sibs or DZ co-twins. Independently segregating blood group markers
are a sample of some 50 to 80 chromosome
Segments found to segregate independently
at meiosis (Pakstis, 1975). Twelve to
twenty blood group markers are, therefore, a fairly good sample of the segments
that sibs or DZ co-twins may share.

Differences between sibs or DZ co-twins
at blood group loci may be correlated with
differences in physical growth, appearance,
and behavior. The hypothesis to be tested
is that sib pairs or co-twins who have fewer
chromosomal differences, marked by blood
group loci, also have more similar physical
and behavioral characteristics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A sample of 145 pairs of DZ twins, on
whom most of the information for this re
port was available, were blood grouped,
tested, photographed, and interviewed. The
twins, aged 10 to 16, were drawn from both
Black and white populations in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

Blood samples were drawn and analyzed
by the Minneapolis War Memorial Blood
Bank. The following red cell and serum
factors were used as markers in the analysis of co-twin differences: ABO, Rh, Kell,
Duffy, MNS, AK, Hp, Tf, Gm, Gc, Cp,
and INV,. If only one blood group difference was found, the laboratory tests were
rerun to check for laboratory error. The
loci at which the co-twins differed were
counted for a simple index of genetic dissimilarity.

Five cognitive tests (Raven Standard
Progressive Matrices, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Columbia Mental Maturity
Scale, Revised Visual Retention Test, and
a paired-associate learning task) and two
personality measures (Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory and the Coopersmith
Self-Esteem Inventory) were administered
as part of a larger battery of psychological,
physical, and dental assessments. Stature,
sitting height, weight, triceps skin-fold
thickness, upper arm circumference, and

head length and breadth were measured
with standard anthropometric techniques.
Skin reflectance was measured with a reflectometer, and skeletal age was rated
from hand-wrist X-rays by the GreulickPyle method. All scores were standardized
to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of
1. Absolute difference scores between cotwins were calculated for all of the standardized measures.

Lateral and full-face head-to-shoulder
black and white photographs were taken of
each twin. The photographs were compiled
by twin pairs. Eight psychology graduate
students, Black and white, male and female, were asked to rate the zygosity of
each pair on a scale from | to 6. A rating
of 1 indicated certainty that the pair was
monozygotic; 6 indicated certainty of dizygosity; and the intermediate numbers represented lesser degrees of certainty about
the ratings. That is, ratings of 1, 2, or 3
were for monozygosity, with 1 being the
most certain and 3 the least certain. Ratings on this scale, therefore, constitute an
index of the similarity in physical appearance of co-twins.

During individual interviews, each of the
co-twins was asked 4 questions: (1) “Do
you and your twin look as alike as carbon
copies?” (2) “Are you and your twin often
mistaken for each other by friends and
teachers?” (3) “Do you think that you are
identical or fraternal twins?” and (4) “Do
you and your twin dress alike? If so, how
often?”

RESULTS

Significant correlations were found between the twins’ perceived differences and
the number of blood group differences.
Those who said they did not look alike
and were not mistaken for each other had
different alleles at more loci. Those DZ
twins who believed they were MZ had

fewer blood group differences than those
who correctly diagnosed their own zygosity
(see Table 1).

Ratings of the twins’ similarity in appearance from photographs confirmed the
twins’ own confusion. Those DZ pairs with
the fewest blood group differences were
most likely to be rated as monozygotic by
the eight raters.

DZ twins with few blood group differences were no more likely to dress alike
than those with many, but neither were all
MZ twins any more likely to dress alike
than all DZ pairs in this sample. Dressing
alike did not correlate with similarity in
appearance.

Of seven measures of physical traits,
only three were significantly correlated
with blood group differences, although
none was negative. There is evidence, therefore, that some measures of physical traits,
other than appearance, may also tend to
be similar among DZ twins with few blood
group differences.

Neither cognitive nor personality measures were consistently related to blood
group differences. Two of the intellective
tests were significantly correlated with
blood groups—in opposite directions. None
of the personality measures was significantly associated with blood group differences.

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

While neither this study nor that of
Loehlin et al. (1974) included the behavioral activity measures reported by Pakstis
et al, (1972), this study does replicate the
significant relationship between blood group
and morphological differences reported in
the Pakstis et al. study. The lack of consistent correlation between blood group
and cognitive differences reported here supports the findings of Loehlin et al.

other traits, blood group markers appear
to be a useful technique for the study of
within-family genetic variability.
