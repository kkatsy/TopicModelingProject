ABSTRACT: Marriage patterns are analyzed in a sample of 750 recently married couples from
the city of Beirut. The data provide evidence for a notable religious endogamy (88 per cent of the
marriages occur within the same religious community, whereas the expected proportion is 34
per cent), and isolation of Muslims and Christians, with some migration occurring inside each
group. Consanguineous marriages are quite frequent within religious communities (26 per cent
of all marriages), the most commonly encountered being first-cousin marriages (63 per cent of
all consanguineous marriages). Patrilateral parallel-cousin marriage, long favored in the Middle East, no longer seems predominant in the recent generation. All four types of first-cousin
marriages are equally preferred. Finally, it is demonstrated that consanguinity correlates negatively with occupational status, educational level, and age at marriage. These social indicators
must therefore be devised as independent variables when studying the effects of consanguinity
on health parameters. In conclusion, the phenomenon of in-group preference, whether in terms
of religion or of family, is still prevalent in this recent urban generation, while some specific

patterns of preference may be changing.

The last census undertaken in Lebanon was in 1943, which explains the lack
of up-to-date demographic data on the
population. According to Courbage and
Fargues (1974), the country in 1970 was
comprised of about 2,265,000 inhabitants, occupying a territory of 10,400
km*. More than one-third of the population was concentrated in the city of
Beirut and its suburbs.

The present-day Lebanese population exhibits a high degree of religious
diversity which is ascribable to the
ethno-religious history of the region.
The geographical configuration of the
country has, since ancient times, enhanced encounter and admixture of
people of diverse origins (Hitti, 1967).
The coastal plain constituted a favored
crossroads between Asia, Africa, and
Europe, while the mountains served asa

 

shelter for the persecuted minorities of
the surrounding regions.

Seven main communities are officially represented. It seems reasonable
to affirm that three communities (Sunnite, Shiite, and Maronite) predominate. The Druze, Greek Orthodox,
Greek Catholic, and Armenian communities, of medium importance, are
the remaining major communities. The
other groups (Jewish, Protestant, and
other Eastern Christian communities)
are smaller minorities (de Vaumas,
1955).

While little information is available
on marriages, knowledge of the prevailing mating customs permits us to point
to a restriction of the exchange between
the communities. However, the degree
of isolation varies widely according to
the group (Der Kaloustian et al., 1980).

While the Druze community is very
closed, marriages between Christian
communities are not infrequent. On the
other hand, Sunnites and Shiites avoid
mating outside their religious groups.

In addition to the religious endogamy, one witnesses the common practice of consanguineous unions. A study
by Loiselet et al. (1971) of the general
Lebanese population mentions an average incidence of consanguineous marriages of 18 per cent, with the highest
rate being among the Druze (41 per
cent).

Given this state of affairs, we have
undertaken a work the aim of which is to
assess the effects of consanguinity on fetal growth and fetal mortality. Starting
from the data gathered for this purpose,
we found it was feasible to analyze the
mating patterns of the respondents, relative to two criteria: (1) religious affiliation, and (2) kinship between spouses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Although population-based samples
provide superior material, they are very
costly in human resources and time.
Considering the state of insecurity prevalent in the country, and the limited
funds at our disposal, it was deemed
wise to rely on a sample of newborns delivered in a hospital for the purposes of
the investigation. Therefore, an interview survey was carried out in the maternity ward of the American University
Hospital of Beirut. All mothers delivering during December, 1981, and January and February, 1982 were questioned. The number of deliveries in the
hospital at this time was around 8 to 10
per day, resulting in asample size of 750.
The data collected comprise information on: (1) age of both parents; (2) date

of marriage; (3) education and occupation of both parents; (4) religion of both
parents; and (5) the nature of genealogical ties, if any, between parents, maternal grandparents, and paternal grandparents.

Whenever there was a kinship, the
pedigree was drawn, and the value of
the inbreeding coefficient of the newborn was computed. All the parameters
were coded and transferred to magnetic
tape. A Data General (Eclipse) was
used in tabulations and statistical analyses.

Lastly, we should mention that the
hospital is located in West Beirut, an
area of mostly Muslim inhabitants, the
civil war having increased this trend.
Also, certain mothers refused to provide their religious affiliations, and
those of their husbands, which resulted
in missing data in the corresponding distributions.

RESULTS

RELIGIOUS ENDOGAMY

In order to ascertain mating patterns
with respect to religion, we calculated
the joint distribution of religious affiliation of both spouses, as is shown in Table 1.

The two predominant communities
are the Sunnites (45.0 per cent of the fathers) and the Shiites (36.5 per cent of
the fathers). One notices a few Druze
and some Christians. This religious
composition reflects the geographical
position of the hospital. The poor representation of the Druze has to be a result
of their rural origins.

The great majority of the observations (87.8 per cent) lie on the diagonal
of the table, that is, correspond to cases

of religious “homogamy.” If matings
were random, the expected proportion
would be 33.6 per cent.

The remaining 12.2 per cent of mixed
marriages occur either between Chnistians or between Muslims (79.8 per cent
of all mixed marriages, whereas the expected proportion is 64.1 per cent), or,
much less frequently, between a Christian and a Muslim (20.2 per cent of all
mixed marriages, whereas the expected
proportion ts 35.9 per cent). Concerning
this latter pattern, one may note that the
table is not symmetrical, since there are
many more marriages between a Muslim man and a Christian woman and
many less between a Muslim woman
and a Christian man than would be expected if the mating process were random. This may be in part attributed to
the fact that the first are licit according
to the Koran, whereas the second are
not.

CONSANGUINITY

The initial step in our study was an
evaluation of the extent of consanguinity, as is described by the frequency of
consanguineous matings. For this purpose, we recognized three classes, regarding the kinship status of the couple:
no kinship; remote kinship (the genealogical tie is not traceable); and identified kinship.

Two generations are represented in
the sample, that of the newborn’s parents and that of his grandparents, the
latter being represented by both the maternal and paternal sides. The distribution of relationship between spouses (in
terms of kinship) by generation is reported in Table 2.

More than one marriage out of four is
consanguineous for both generations:
26.0 per cent of all marriages among the
parents, and 27.3 per cent and 21,1 per

cent, respectively, among the maternal
and paternal grandparents. The lower
value of this latter percentage has to be
correlated with the sampling method.
The mothers had to furnish information
about their in-law’s, and there may have
been involuntary omissions, due to the
ignorance of certain genealogical ties.

The proportion of consanguineous
marriages seem stable from one generation to the other. A comparison of the
proportions between parents and maternal grandparents provides an e value of
—0.58, which is not significant.

Such rates are quite high, and, in order to quantify the amount of consan
guinity, we have calculated the mean inbreeding coefficient of the newborns.
The obtained value is F = 0.01334.
Given the current practice of consanguineous matings, one may wonder
about the nature of this consanguinity.
Aiming to identify the most popular patterns, we have established the distribution of the consanguineous marriages by
type of kinship and generation (Table
3). No uncle-niece marriage is encountered (it is forbidden by the Koran).
First-cousin marriages are predominant
among the different types represented:
62.6 per cent of all consanguineous marriages among the parents, and 68.8 per

cent and 65.2 per cent, respectively,
among the maternal and paternal grandparents. The proportion of first-cousin
marriages seems stable from one generation to the other. A comparison of the
proportions between parents and maternal grandparents provides an € value of
~—1.31, which is not significant.
However, the category ‘“‘firstcousins” is heterogeneous, as are the
others, and, in order to pursue the analysis at a finer level, we split it into the
four underlying pedigrees (Table 4).
Two points are noteworthy: (1) Patrilateral parallel-cousin marriage is obviously the favored practice as seen by the
grandparents’ distributions. Fitting a
uniform distribution to the data provides chi-squares of 66.40 and 80.26 respectively, for the matemal and paternal sides, both significant at the 1 per
cent level for 3 degrees of freedom. (2)
In contrast, a different pattern emerges
for the parents’ distribution. This one is
uniform. Chi-square is equal to 2.39,
which is not significant for 3 degrees of
freedom. Hence, the data provide evidence for some changing in the matri

monial choices from one generation to
the other.

Lastly, the nature of the data permitted us to characterize the protagonists of
the consanguineous unions on socioreligious grounds. To reach this goal, we
have constituted several contingency tables showing the joint distribution of
kinship status of the couple (consanguinity or lack thereof) and one socioeconomic or demographic variable relative to either spouse.

In a summary, we may read the following pattern into the figures. The
probability of contracting a consanguineous mating significantly diminishes
when

(a) educational level increases (from
33.3 per cent consanguineous marriages
when father is illiterate or did not complete primary school to 21.8 per cent
when his educational level is secondary
school or above);

(b) social status rises (from 29.3 per
cent consanguineous marriages among
unskilled workers, to 17.6 per cent
among professional classes and managers
of big business);

(c) age at marriage increases (mean
age at marriage for husband and wife varies from, respectively, 26.74 and 20.21
when mating is consanguineous, to 29.04
and 21.20 when it is not);

(d) shifting from Muslims to Christians (respectively, 28 per cent and 13.7
per cent consanguineous marriages).

DISCUSSION

The endogamous mechanisms operating in the Lebanese population may
be viewed as active at two levels: first,
the religious level, and second, the family level.

Concerning the religious criteria, the
present study provides evidence for a
noteworthy endogamy, and an isolation
of the two main groups, Christians and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

Vol. 33, No. 1~2

Muslims, with a certain amount of migration occurring between religious
communities belonging to the same
group. This scheme is consistent with
the results of Lalouel et al (1976). By
taking into account a series of genetic
markers such as ABO, Rh, haptoglobins, etc., and using the genetic distance
technique, the authors identified a significant global heterogeneity between
the religious communities, essentially
attributable to differences between the
two larger groups of Christians and
Muslims. On the other hand, Serre
(1976) does not find any significant pattern with respect to the HLA system.
Other studies, dealing with biochemical
markers as well as anthropometrics,
could throw light on this topic.

As regards the consanguinity which
prevails in the population, an initial
point has to be made about the data relative to both generations. Due to the
sampling method, the parental and
grandparental distributions are not independent, and this somewhat restricts
the viability of a comparison. However,
given the objective of this analysis, it
seems to us that such a bias in no way invalidates the conclusions.

The frequency of consanguineous
marriages observed in the sample, as
well as the calculated mean inbreeding
coefficient, correspond to the higher
range described for human populations
(Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971;
Freire-Maia, 1982). Indeed, only in certain isolates such as the Hutterites of
South Dakota and Minnesota (Mange,
1964), the Dunkers of Pennsylvania
(Glass, et al., 1952) and the Samaritans
of Israel and Jordan (Bonne, 1963))
does the mean inbreeding coefficient attain high levels, whereas it rarely exceeds 1 per cent in the majority of the
large populations. One well-known ex

ception is the Indian population, where
the high occurrence of consanguineous
marriages (mainly in the south) has long
provided a suitable background for population biology studies (Sibert, et al.,
1979; Rao and Inbaraj, 1980; Sanghvi,
1982). Brazil (Freire-Maia, 1968) and
Japan (Schull and Neel, 1965) also display substantial levels of inbreeding.

For the Lebanese population, no estimate of the mean inbreeding coefficient
is yet available. The rates which we have
calculated cannot be assimilated to a nationwide mean. The sample is of urban
origin, and furthermore there is a religious bias, given the area which was chosen. Nevertheless, our figures lend credence to the existence of a high level of
inbreeding in the population, and this
inbreeding does not seem to decline
from one generation to the other. Sucha
situation justifies investigations about
the long-term effects of inbreeding on
specific gene frequencies.

As to consanguineous marriage practices, first-cousin unions constitute the
predominant type of mating for both
generations. However, when the analysis is carried to a finer level, the two generations display different patterns. Patrilateral parallel-cousin marriage is
identified as the favorite custom in the
grandparental generation, whereas no
overtly preferred practice is evident for
the parental generation. The specific father’s brother’s daughter marriage has
long been recognized as a common Middle Eastern practice (Khuri, 1970). Anthropologists agree that the main
achievement of this type of marriage is
the maintenance of family structure and
property (Granqvist, 1931; Rosenfeld,
1957), given the Koranic laws of inheritance. The disappearance of this pattern
of preference in the most recent generation, in favor of an equilibrium between

the different types of cousin marriages,
may correspond to a changing matrimonial behavior, given modern urban life
styles. We have developed this topic in
another publication (Klat and Khudr, in
press).

Ultimately, the detection of an association between endogamy, religious affiliation, and socioeconomic status has
important implications for future genetic studies. As has been stressed by
many authors (Neel and Schull, 1970;
Rao and Inbaraj, 1977, 1980), consanguinity effects on demographic and
health parameters are liable to be over

This raises the problem of choosing adequate controls, in order to avoid possible confounding with nongenetic influences.
