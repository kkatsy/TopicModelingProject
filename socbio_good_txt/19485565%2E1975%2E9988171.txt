Intellect and Serum Uric Acid: An Optimal
Concentration of Serum Urate for

Human Learning?

Orowan (1955) originally pointed out
that the structure of uric acid is very similar to caffein, a known central nervous
system (CNS) stimulant, and that serum
uric acid (SUA) might therefore prove to
be an endogenous cortical stimulant. Orowan further suggested than man’s intellectual growth was enhanced by the constant
cortical arousal provided by this stimulant.
In terms of the evolution of intelligence,
the significance of this hypothesis becomes
apparent when it is realized that, among
mammals, elevated serum uric acid levels
are restricted to primates and particularly
man.

The general interpretation of Orowan’s
hypothesis has followed a linear model
which predicts a simple correlation between
SUA level and intellectual] ability (see Figure 1), However, research and clinical data
exist (Stevens and Cropley, 1972) suggesting that the interpretation of Orowan’s
hypothesis should be based on a curvilinear
or inverted-U model, implying a psychologically optimal SUA concentration, This inverted-U hypothesis suggests that increases

in SUA, up to an optimal level, lead to improved CNS performance. However, increases beyond this proposed optimal range
would lead to impairment of performance,
possibly because of cortical overstimulation
(see Figure 2). This interpretation is consistent with the known behavioral consequences of other CNS stimulants such as
caffein, whose actions are also dose-dependent (Calhoun, 1971; Hahn, 1960).
Clinical evidence exists to support the
curvilinearity of the SUA-intelligence association suggested in Figure 2. The LeschNyhan syndrome is an X-linked condition
with four clinical characteristics: mental

retardation, neurological abnormalities, obsessive destructive behavior, and hyperuricemia (Nyhan, 1968; Stanbury et al.,
1972). Of central importance here is this
association between intellectual retardation and extremely elevated uric acid synthesis. Patients with this disorder have
SUA levels as high as 24 mg./100 ml. and
excrete three to six times the normal
amount of uric acid in their urine. The
discoverers of this syndrome have speculated that the retardation found in these
patients may be due, in part, to this presence of highly elevated SUA. They suggest
that this CNS stimulant may have a toxic
effect when present in large quantities
(Nyhan et al., 1965). Seegmiller (1972)
has questioned the direct cause-effect relationship between this disorder and hyperuricemia, suggesting that the causal factors
may be somewhat more complex. However,
while the exact relationship between highly
elevated levels of uric acid and this syndrome is not clear at this point, the association is well documented. This association
can be viewed as sufficient clinical evidence
to justify testing the concept illustrated in
Figure 2.

Behaviorally optimal levels of excitation

or arousal are quite well recognized in
psychology. For example, the Yerkes-Dodson law of anxiety and learning demonstrates that some anxiety heightens an
individual’s learning performance while
deviations in either direction from this
optimal level produce a decrement in
learning performance. A similar phenomenon is predicted (Stevens and Cropley,
1972) for levels of SUA and CNS efficiency.
That is, it should be possible to demonstrate experimentally the existence of an
optimal level of SUA vis-4-vis the relationship between subjects’ serum uric acid
levels and their scores on learning tests.
In addition, it should be possible to support the optimal level hypothesis epidemiologically; this could be done, for example, by demonstrating progressively Jess
deviation from the optimum concentration
in a succession of groups selected on the
basis of apparently increasing levels of cortical efficiency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Uric acid was measured on the Hycel
Mark X with duplicate assays done on the
technicon SMA 12-60; the correlation between both methods of analysis was 0.93.
The results quoted are all from the Mark
X. Precision was evaluated by running
replicate assays on successive days and a
correlation coefficient of 0.99 was obtained
between these assays. The stability of serum
uric acid levels within the individual was
determined by resampling 48 subjects two
or more days after their initial sample. The
correlation coefficient between the first and
second sample assays was 0.79. The actual
difference between assays was small and
generally less than 0.5 mg./100 ml. This
observation agrees with other findings such
as those by Banerjee and Saha (1967) on
individual serum uric acid level stability.

The data studied in the present paper
come from four different male populations,

(Females were excluded from this study because the relationship between serum uric
acid level and the menstrual cycle is not
clear at this time.) Population 1 consists
of the over two thousand 18 to 22 year old
male subjects of the Tecumseh study (Mikkelsen, Dodge, and Valkenberg, 1965).
Population 2 consists of 126 samples from
males aged 18 to 22, submitted to the
Saskatchewan Provincial Laboratory for
routine premarital serum analysis. The
third population is made up of 115 male
undergraduate university students aged 18
to 22. The fourth population consists of 15
male university faculty members whose age
was greater than that of the first three populations.

The learning ability of Population 3 was
assessed (Stevens, 1973) in a doubled-blind
experimental design using four learning
tests. The four learning measures consisted
of Pascal and Jenkins’ (1959) HunterPascal Concept Formation Test (H-P),
Berg’s (1948) Wisconsin Card Sorting
Test (WCST), Ammons and Ammons’
(1959) Standard Anagram Task (SAT),
and Cook, Heim, and Watts’ (1963) Word
in Context Test (WINC). All four of
these learning measures assess the apparently unique primate ability to form
and use concepts (Razran, 1971).

PROCEDURE

The administration of the learning tasks
and the taking of the blood sample involved
an individual and a group experimental
session. In order to reduce possible order
effects on the learning test results, half the
subjects had their individual sessions first,
while the remaining half of the subjects took
part in a group session first. The lapse time
between sessions was from 0 to 7 days with
the average lapse being 4.3 days. The
group sessions each involved from 7 to 14
subjects and lasted about 214 hours.

During the group sessions, the subjects

completed the SAT and WINC leaming
measures and gave a registered laboratory
technician a 25cc. blood sample which was
immediately spun off and _ refrigerated.
Serum uric acid assays were completed
within 3 days. The individual sessions
lasted approximately forty minutes during
which the subjects took the H-P and WCST
learning tests. An extensive number of control measures relevant to the assessment of
the dependent and independent variables
was taken in the group and individual experimental sessions. These control measures included questions pertaining to diet,
past and present state of health, general
level of anxiety, and motivation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Population 3 was divided into low,
middle, and high SUA levels. The low and
high groups consisted of those subjects with
the lowest and highest 10 per cent of the
sample’s SUA levels respectively. The relationship between the students’ obtained
learning scores and the 3 SUA groups is
shown in Figure 3. There is improved performance on all four learning tests as the
Serum uric acid concentration increases to
5.0 mg./100 ml., and three of the tests
suggest a decrease in performance as the
SUA level exceeds 5.0 mg./100 ml. Figure
3 is therefore quite supportive of the hypothesized curvilinear, or inverted-U, relationship between SUA and learning.
However, a statistical examination of the
data was somewhat more conservative in
its support of the hypothesis, as chi-square
tests of association only confirmed the SUAlearning hypothesis for the H-P and WCST
measures of Jearning (p <0.025). The apparent association between SUA and scores
on the SAT and WINC tests, as shown in
Figure 3, may be due to chance findings.

standard deviation for the four populations used in the epidemiological study of

SUA and cortical efficiency. Population 1,
from the Tecumseh study, represents the
total healthy noninstitutionalized male population aged 18 to 22. The mean is 4.9
mg./100 ml., and the standard deviation
is 1.40.

Population 2 consists of the SUA levels
obtained from young males about to be
married. It might be argued that these men
are somewhat intellectually superior to the
total male population (Group 1) as they
were all fit and vigorous enough to convince some girl to marry them! This population has a mean of 5.1 mg./100 ml. and
a standard deviation of 1.23.

Population 3 consists of university undergraduate males, members of a group
which is generally thought to be intellectually selected. The mean of this group is 5.0
mg./100 ml. with a standard deviation of
0.96.

Population 4, male university faculty
members, clearly represents a highly select

group of intellectuals. It is significant that
all but one have SUA levels between 4.0
and 6.0 mg./100 ml., with the single exception having an SUA level of 6.1 mg./
100 ml. The mean of this group is 5.0
mg./100 ml. with a standard deviation of
0.65 mg./100 ml. As illustrated in Table 1,
deviation from the remarkably consistent
5.0 mg./100 ml. mean SUA level becomes
progressively less as groups increasingly
selected for intelligence are studied.

Several earlier studies on the distribution of SUA Ievels in various populations
also strengthen the position that a psychologically optimal level of SUA probably
exists. For example, Dunn et al. (1963)
report mean SUA values for several skilled
occupational groups. They found 532
craftsmen had a mean SUA level of 4.77,
76 Ph.D. scientists had a mean of 5.34,
96 medical students had a mean of 5.44,
and 339 businessmen had a mean level of
5.73. These means are close to the optimum level of 5.0 mg./100 ml. suggested by
the data reported in this paper.

If an optimal level exists, one would expect skilled groups of workers to reflect a
mean SUA level close to this optimum. The
slight differences between the mean of
these occupational groups and the proposed
optimal level of 5.0 mg./100 ml. may be due
to differences in laboratory analyses, control measures used, etc. However, it may be
more prudent to interpret these differences

as suggesting that while this study indicates that the optimal level of SUA is
5.0 mg./100 ml., other data suggest that
a slightly higher concentration may be
optimum. The actual ideal range may have
to be determined by experimental manipulation of uric acid levels. Such investigations will also have the advantage of being
able to weigh the cause-effect issue more
directly than the correlational studies mentioned here.

The results are generally supportive of
the optimal concentration hypothesis for
serum uric acid; that is, there is evidence,
based on data from psychological and
epidemiological assessments, which suggests
that behaviorally manifested maximum
cortical efficiency in males is associated
with an SUA level of approximately 5.0
mg./100 ml., and that deviations in either
direction from this concentration are associated with less effective intellectual functioning, presumably because of hypo- or
hyper-CNS stimulation. It therefore appears that Orowan’s notion of the evolutionary significance of SUA may be at least
partially correct.

While the apparently adaptive influence
of optimally elevated SUA levels is neither
sufficient nor necessary for intellectual superiority, it may indeed have conferred a
selective advantage in the evolution of intelligence. The significance of these results
lies in this apparent correlation between the
male population’s mean SUA level and a
psychologically optimal SUA concentration
for males. The authors anticipate that a
similar correlation will be found between
the female mean SUA level and their psychologically optimal level of urate concentration. This finding suggests that the
evolutionary rise in serum uric acid levels,
to the present mean level, was not without
some favorable result.

Intellect and Serum Uric Acid

233

A number of cross-cultural and crosssocioeconomic surveys, such as those by
Healey et al. (1966) and Duff et al. (1968),
have suggested that various ethnic and
economic populations may be relatively or
actually hypo- or hyperuricemic. These
states are presumably due to a combination
of genetic predisposition, dietary preferences and general dietary deficiencies.
Behavioral scientists have to date shown
little interest in such epidemiological findings in spite of the association between
SUA levels and the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This disinterest is presumably because these variations in SUA levels have
not been directly linked to any obvious
clinical disorder within the various ethnic
and economic populations studied. However, if later experimental research upholds the findings of the correlational investigation outlined here, there will be a
rather strong case in favor of cultural patterns and individual habits which support
the maintenance of an optimal level of
serum uric acid.

SUMMARY

Psychological and epidemiological data
from four different male populations were
examined. The results support the hypothesis that, within yet to be definitively defined
optimal concentrations, serum uric acid
acts to facilitate learning and that deviations from this optimal limit are associated
with a decrement in Jearning ability. The
findings are related to Orowan’s notion
(1955) of the evolution of human intelligence and the general concern surrounding
cultural and individual factors that influence the biological correlates of human behavior.
