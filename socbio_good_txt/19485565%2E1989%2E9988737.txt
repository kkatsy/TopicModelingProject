The Norm for Perceived Husband Superiority:
A Cause of Human Assortative Marriage

ABSTRACT: I have suggested that human assortative marriage for a number of variables is
partially caused by behavior in accordance with two norms. Epstein and Guttman (1987) have
suggested that there is no empirical evidence for these norms. In this note evidence is reviewed
for the norm of perceived husband-superiority. Others have shown that the evidence for this
norm is strong in regard to height, and it is shown here that the evidence is strong also in regard
to age. Evidence for the norm seems suggestive in regard to IQ, education, and social class, and
nonexistent in regard to physical attractiveness. With respect to height, it seems that the
magnitude of the correlation between spouses is associated with the size of the breeding
population to which they belong. Thus, it seems likely that the hypothesized norms are learned

rather than genetically coded.

It is well established that human beings marry assortatively for a number of
variables. Correlations between spouses
have been reported as being of the following order for the given variables:
age, 0.76; stature, 0.28; eye color, 0.26;
weight, 0.21; cephalic index, 0.02; memory, 0.57; IQ, 0.47; neurosis, 0.30; dominance, 0.15; religious affiliation, 0.75;
drinking habits, 0.55; number of children desired, 0.51; years of education,
0.40; and number of siblings, 0.10
(Berelson and Steiner, 1964). Many of
these correlations present no immediate
interest, their explanations presumably
lying in the fact that marriage partners
are found, not randomly, but within social networks; and that, having met,
partners may influence one another’s
behavior. However, one may wonder
whether this would explain the magnitudes of some of these correlations. I

have suggested that some correlations
may be based on a norm for “‘perceived
husband-superiority” in that heterosexual men and women seek and find relationships in which the man is—or
seems—in some sense ‘‘dominant” and
the woman “‘submissive’”’ (James,
1983a). I later suggested another norm
which would also, independently, help
explain assortative mating—the norm
for avoiding obvious physical and intellectual disparities between members of
couples (Mutt-and-Jeff avoidance,
James, 1987). By “norm” I mean a rule
of conduct of which the subjects are
more or less aware and which is nevertheless not always obeyed.

It is clear how assortative mating may
result if couples behave in accordance
with the Mutt-and-Jeff norm. But it may
be worth explaining how conforming
with the husband-superior norm has the

same effect. If tall men and short
women are prepared to marry any partner (tall or short), but short men are prepared only to marry short women, and
tall women are prepared only to marry
tall men, we can foresee the probable
result. Tall men, being in competition
with short men in the search for short
women, will be under pressure to marry
tall women; and short women, being in
competition with tall women in the
search for tall men, will be under pressure to marry short men. Thus, a correlation between mates’ stature will result.
This correlation stems not from any
preference of individuals for mates of
their own size, but simply from a preference of both partners for a height differential favoring the man.

In response to my 1987 ‘“‘Mutt-andJeff avoidance” hypothesis, Epstein and
Guttman (1987) upbraided me for my
“faulty logic, oversimplified and unsupported assumptions and irresponsible
use of the word ‘superior.’ ’” The meaning of some of their strictures is less clear
than the intention to abuse. However,
the main burden of Epstein and Guttman’s note, as I understand it, is that
there is no empirical support for these
norms. J suggest that there is an abundance of such evidence for the husbandsuperior norm. I shall treat it by some of
the variables for which assortative mating is known to exist.

ASSORTATIVE MATING FOR
HEIGHT

1. Epstein and Guttman (1987) review the finding of Gillis and Avis (1980)
that even bearing in mind that (1) men
are taller than women on the average
and that (2) there is a positive correlation between the heights of husbands
and wives, there is still a highly signi
 

Social Biology

ficant deficit of matings in which the husband is shorter than his wife. Epstein
and Guttman add: “To our knowledge
no study has explicitly determined
whether the actual incidence of tallermar/shorter woman in mate selection
differs significantly from chance”. Yet
the significant deficit (assessed by a Poisson probability of less than 0.00002) implies a concomitant excess (height being
a continuous variable).

2. McManus and Mascie-Taylor
(1984) investigated the heights of 12,994
couples ascertained by the fact that the
wife bore a child in one week of 1958.
These authors noted (following others)
that there is assortative mating for
height, the overall correlation across the
sample being +0.258. However, the association is nonlinear and heteroscedastic. In particular, consider the heights of
spouses of people who are at the
“wrong” end of the height continua,
that is, of index men less than 5’2” and
of index women more than 5711”. The
mean heights of the spouses of these indexes are closer to the overall means
than would be estimated from the overall regression, and the variances of the
heights of the spouses of these indexes
are significantly greater than the adjacent variances in the distribution. These
authors suggest that the bivariate distribution “‘probably reflects a social expectation, (the “male-taller norm,” Gillis
and Avis, 1980) which results in increased assortative mating as the critical
point of height equality is reached,
coupled with the limitations imposed by
a lack of appropriate persons from
whom to select as one approaches either
extreme of height, which results in a
lessening of assortative mating.”

It seems to me that in addition to confirming my suggestion that the maletaller norm is partially responsible for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 36, No. 3-4

assortative marriage, these authors unwittingly suggest the existence of the
Mutt-and-Jeff norm. A paucity of suitable partners for very tall men or very
short women implies such a norm,
whereas the male-taller norm by itself
would suggest a plenitude of such partners.

3. Epstein and Guttman (1987) suggest that those individuals lying at the
“wrong” end of a continuum for their
sex are less likely to marry, thus impugning my explanation for the positive correlations between spouses. There is
something in this point. But a very large
proportion of people do marry; and of
those not marrying, a large number are
unwavering homosexuals, institutionalized defectives, the chronic sick, the
mad, the demented, and social misfits of
assorted kinds. They are unmarried,
that is to say, for reasons other than
their height. Thus, the selection invoked
by Epstein and Guttman, though it
doubtless exists, cannot be very powerful and is unlikely to have any substantial effect on my proposed explanation
for assortative mating.

As noted above, McManus and
Mascie-Taylor (1984) attribute the large
variance of heights of co-spouses of indexes of the “‘wrong” height to the difficulty they have in finding suitable partners. One testable probable consequence of this is that husband-shorter
spouses are older at marriage than
husband-taller spouses, on the average.

4, McManus and Mascie-Taylor
(1984) remark of the observed bivariate
distribution (of spouses’ heights) that its
cause is presumably not simply some
form of social selection (e.g., by social
class) because, if it were, one would expect a joint normal distribution, the association being linear and the variance
homoscedastic. They also note that

Brief Reports 273

though the husband-taller norm seems
to operate, one cannot tell from the
form of the distribution whether the motivation comes from women or men, or
both.

However, there is other evidence on
this point. If heterosexual lonelyhearts
columns may be regarded as any guide,
both men and women search for partners who will enable them, as a couple,
to observe the norm. In such columns
published in England, “petite” is a favorite adjective of male advertisers and
“tall” of female ones specifying their
hearts’ desire. Direct data are available
on the influence of height in the search
for a mate. In the material of Beigel
(1954), females stated a mean preference for a man taller than themselves by
6.7 inches (16.8 cms), and males expressed a mean preference for women
shorter by 4.5 inches (11.3 cms). Very
similar figures were reported by Gillis
and Avis (1980) in an undergraduate
sample.

Apparently most women do not
yearn for a man shorter than themselves; and most men do not yearn for a
woman taller than themselves. However, in this regard, it seems that men
may be more choosy than women. The
correlation between the heights of the
spouses of male MZ twins is substantially higher than that between the
heights of the spouses of female MZ
twins (Nance et al., 1980). Moreover the
variances of ages of brides marrying
grooms of a given age are generally
smaller than the variances of ages of
grooms marrying brides of the same age
(McManus and Mascie-Taylor, 1984).

In view of the highly significant deficit
of husband-shorter marriages, and of
the clearly stated preferences of those in
the marriage market, and of the curious
features of the bivariate distribution of

heights of husbands and wives, the onus
is on those who deny the existence of a
husband-taller norm to provide explanations for these phenomena.

5. It is not suggested that the hypothesized behavioral norms are universal
human characteristics. Wolanski and Siniarska (1984) reviewed spouse correlations for height from over 60 populations. They found that the magnitude of
the correlations between spouses was
associated with the size of the breeding
population to which the spouses belonged. Very small (less than 400 individuals) isolated populations seem to
yield negative correlations. These authors note that in very small populations, random mating would result in a
high degree of inbreeding with consequent inbreeding depression. Hence, in
such a population, there would be reproductive advantage in choosing a
mate rather dissimilar to oneself (negative assortative mating). Wolanski and
Siniarska (1984) also speculate that
there may be some reproductive advantage (via reduced fetal and infant mortality) in positive assortative mating in
large populations with substantial migration. Their hypothesis is that, for
maximum fitness, there is optimum degree of similarity between mates; and
that this is most likely to be achieved by
negative assortative mating in small
populations, and positive assortative
mating in large populations.

If this were true, then one might suppose that such behavioral norms as underlie mate choice are learned, rather
than genetically coded. It would certainly be interesting to know if the mate
preferences (as opposed to the actual
mate choices) of people in small isolated
communities also exemplify negative assortative mating.

ASSORTATIVE MATING BY AGE

Bivariate distributions of ages of
spouses at marriage show substantial
overall positive correlations, and these
distributions are (like the one discussed
above) both nonlinear and heteroscedastic. To test whether there is a deficit
of husband-younger marriages, I examined the bivariate distribution of ages of
all brides and grooms in England and
Wales, 1985 (Registrar General, 1987).
The mean of the husbands’ ages, @;,, was
29.86 years. The mean of the wives’
ages, dy, was 27.10 years. The productmoment correlation between them, 7;,,,
was +0.846. The standard deviation of
the husbands’ ages, 6,, was 10.44 years.
The standard deviation of the wives’
ages, 6,, was 9.58 years. Consider the
distribution of individual age differences (a, — ay). Though the distributions of husbands’ ages and of wives’
ages are both nonnormal, one would expect the distribution of their differences
to approximate normality. The mean of
this distribution is

and its variance is

the standard formula for the variance of
the difference between two correlated
variables. The ‘proportion of husbandyounger marriages expected is that area
under the curve to the left of the ordinate x = 0. And this is assessed by the
normalized deviate

The empirical values of all these parameters are known.

 
 

Vol. 36, No. 3-4

The z-score estimated thus is 0.49;
and the area under the curve outside this
value is about 0.31. The total number of
marriages was 346,389. So the expected
number in which the husband is younger
is 0.31 x 346,389 = 107,380. Consider
those cells in which the husbands’ and
wives’ ages are reportedly the same (to
within one year until age 24, and within
5 years thereafter). Let us assume that

there are equal numbers of husbandSyounger and husband-older couples in
each such cell. Then the observed num‘ber of husband-younger couples was
295.082. In other words, the observed
Ahusband-younger deficit (which numerically equals the husband-older excess) is
“of the order of 11 per cent and the cor“responding chi-squared values (for the
excess and for the deficit) both far ex‘gceed tabled values.

ceed those of brides’ ages (for indexes of
a given age).

There are several features of this bivariate distribution which it shares with
McManus and Mascie-Taylor’s (1984)
bivariate distribution by height. Even if
the hypothesis of male-superiority were
correct, one would not expect more
than some degree of similarity between
the distributions for the following reasons.

1. The hypothesized disadvantages
suffered by a very short man in the marriage market are permanent. They thus
form a plausible explanation for the
large variance of heights of wives of such
men. In contrast, the hypothesized disadvantages suffered by a very young
man disappear with time. Thus, one
would not expect a comparable large

276 Brief Reports

variance in the ages of spouses of young
men.

2. Because of the legal bar to marriage below the age of 16 (in England
and Wales), men of 16 could not marry
women younger than themselves even if
they wished. This fact also imposes a restriction on the variance of the ages of
their spouses (as contrasted with the
variance of the heights of the spouses of
very short men).

In short, it seems that the curious features of the bivariate distribution by age
of bride and groom are partially explained by the fact that most men and
most women seek and find a partner
who will enable them as a couple to conform with the husband-superior norm.
People may read such authors as Vizinczey (1985) extolling older women and
feature articles in magazines like Cosmopolitan praising younger men. But
when marriage is undertaken, such advocacy is largely disregarded.

Perhaps further light may be thrown
on the motivation of individuals in the
marriage market by the use of an index
devised by Gray (1987). He was concerned with the motives of foreign-born
Australians marrying partners from the
same country of origin. He devised indexes (one for each sex) which purport
to distinguish the extent to which such
intermarriage is a consequence of preference as contrasted with mere opportunity. It may be possible to use Gray’s indexes to make such a distinction within
the motivations of brides and grooms of
given age categories.

ASSORTATIVE MATING BY
EDUCATION AND
INTELLIGENCE

Epstein and Guttman (1987) write
that in the context of education my

Social Biology

“idea suddenly seems rather absurd, especially in light of the lack of data showing that ‘male superiority for education’
even -exists.” If Epstein and Guttman
mean by this statement that we do not
know whether men are better educated
than women on the average, the point is
irrelevant. The point is that husbands
and wives correlate positively for educational level and IQ, and that this would
be partially explained if men and
women choose mates who will enable
them as a couple to conform to the norm
of male superiority.

Anyone doubting the existence of
this norm may reflect that in a university
setting, it is a commonplace to hear
women complain that the courtship
process is jeopardized if a woman reveals that she is intelligent. Less often
does one hear men complain that the
courtship process is jeopardized if a man
reveals his lack of intelligence. One may
nevertheless assume that it is. In this
context one might reflect on Dorothy
Parker’s aphorism that men seldom
make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Bespectacled men seem not to suffer
discrimination to the same degree.
Spectacles are an index of intelligence
(Karlsson, 1975). As such, they may deter men more than women.

ASSORTATIVE MATING BY
PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS

It is not claimed that the two hypothesized norms operate on every variable
on which human beings can rank the opposite sex. Most men do not seek
women who are less attractive than
themselves. And though most women
seem to give less weight to the matter, it
seems that assortative mating for physical attractiveness is caused by the fact
that most people seek as attractive a
Vol. 36, No. 34

partner as may be available (and what is
available depends—to some extent—on
one’s own appearance).

ASSORTATIVE MATING BY
SOCIAL CLASS

This paper attempts to identify some
behavioral norms of which assortative
mating is a secondary effect. There is
certainly assortative mating for social

— class, but I know no data which would

“enable one to determine whether this
may be partially a consequence of a

COMMENT

Genetic models of assortation have
Q generally assumed mechanisms which
are “‘symmetric,” in that males and females seek the same traits in spouses. In
regard to some variables, these models

ownloaded by

Brief Reports

 

277

are unrealistic. The reproductive strategies of the two sexes differ. Some of
these differences seem consistent with
sociobiological expectation. For instance, one may note the apparent male
choosiness with respect to obvious physical characteristics such as age, height,
and beauty. However, this note has not
addressed the problem of whether
women actually are more interested in
those more subtle traits which presumably characterize reliable protectors of,
and providers for, potential offspring.
Attention here has so far been
confined to the causes of assortative
mating. One might note a possible consequence of it. The variances of ages of
co-spouses to indexes of a given age at
marriage seem substantially to exceed
the variances at first birth (James, 1974).
The natural inference is that the fertility
of spouses of the more extreme age
combinations (in both directions) is
lower than that of spouses in the modal
age combinations. It would be interesting to know the causes. One cause may
be diminished coital rates (James,
1983b). It would also be interesting to
know whether experimental animals
show age-related preferences in regard
to the age of mating partners; and if so,
whether this trait has a genetic basis.
