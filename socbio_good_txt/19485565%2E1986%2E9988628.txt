ABSTRACT: U.S. vital registration data on live births and data on abortions and ectopic pregnancies from a national hospital discharge survey were used to examine the seasonality of conceptions and the influence the conception pattern has on the monthly incidence of abortions and
ectopic pregnancies. We found that in the United States conceptions follow a consistent seasonal pattern with the peak in November and December. However, when the pattern for conceptions is controlled, the monthly variation for abortions and ectopic pregnancies is not significant. Therefore, we find no monthly excess for any of these outcomes of pregnancy over that
expected as a consequence of the seasonality of conception. We suggest the monthly variation
for the number of each of these pregnancy outcomes will best be explained when the seasonal

variation in conceptions is understood.

Several studies have suggested that in
the United States conceptions have a
seasonal pattern with the major peak in
November and December (Kaplan,
1973; Cohen and Bracken, 1977; Warren, 1978; Warren et al., 1980; Seiver,
1985). Most of these studies make this
point after analyzing the seasonality of
live births (Warren, 1978; Seiver, 1985),
live births and spontaneous abortions
(Kaplan, 1973; Warren et al., 1980), or
live births and induced abortions (Cohen and Bracken, 1977). From these
studies there is little question that conceptions follow a seasonal pattern; however, there is much debate as to the effect the conception pattern has on the
individual seasonal patterns for various
pregnancy outcomes.

Kaplan (1973) and McDonald (1971)
found an excess of spontaneous abortions in the spring (after controlling for
conceptions) and suggested that infective agents that are epidemic in the
spring may be the explanation. In con
trast, Warren et al. (1980) found no
monthly excess of spontaneous abortions after controlling for conceptions.
He and his colleagues concluded that
the monthly number of spontaneous
abortions is probably related to the seasonal pattern of conceptions. In their
analysis of induced abortion, Cohen and
Bracken (1977) came to a conclusion
similar to that of Warren et al. (1980).

The purpose of this study is to expand
on the findings from these earlier studies
by focusing on the question:

If conceptions are seasonal, how does the

monthly pattern of conceptions influence

the monthly incidence of induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, and/or ectopic pregnancies?

Our study, compared with earlier
studies, includes more pregnancy outcomes in the definition of conception
(i.e., conceptions = live births + induced abortions + spontaneous abortions + ectopic pregnancies) and a
more extensive analysis of the influence

of the seasonality of conception on the
timing of induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, and ectopic pregnancies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our study includes data for 1974-82.
For our analysis of live births, we used
data from the annual reports of the vital
statistics of the United States. For data
on the other pregnancy outcomes (i.e.,
induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, and ectopic pregnancies), we used
the 1974-82 National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS).

The NHDS is an annual survey of patients admitted to short stay hospitals in
the United States for surgical procedures, disease, or injury (NCHS, 1970).
Each year, the NHDS selects a systematic sample of the discharge records
from more than four hundred nonfederal hospitals representing all fifty states
and the District of Columbia; the records include diagnostic codes based on
the International Classification of Diseases (ICDA) coding scheme (NCHS,
1967, 1980). The ICDA coding scheme
has changed over time. In our study, the
8th revision coding scheme is used for
the sample records during 1974-78 and

Seasonal! Variation in Conception 117

the 9th revision for 1979-82. The codes
for each of the pregnancy outcomes,
other than live births, included in our
study are shown in Table 1.

We estimated the number of conceptions in a given month by adding the
number of live births lagged nine
months from their month of occurrence
to the number of induced, spontaneous,
and unspecified abortions and the number of ectopic pregnancies all lagged
three months from their month of occurrence. We used this estimate of the
monthly number of conceptions in two
ways: (1) to describe the seasonal pattern of conceptions, and (2) as the denominator in calculating the monthly induced and spontaneous abortion rates
and the ectopic pregnancy rate.

When determining the seasonal
models for conceptions, live births,
abortions, and ectopic pregnancies, we
made two adjustments to the monthly
numbers of each event. First, the numbers of events per month were normalized to thirty-day equivalent values, so
the difference in the number of days per
month was eliminated. Second, these
normalized numbers were expressed as
monthly percentages of the total events
for a year, thus putting the description

of the monthly pattern for all events on
the same scale.

We used periodic regression analysis
(PRA), a statistical technique that analyzes cyclic phenomena, to test statistically for seasonal variation in these
events (Bliss, 1970; Kutner et al., 1978).
The aim of PRA is to describe the behavior of a cyclic phenomenon by constructing a regression model that includes enough terms to reduce the
scatter about the fitted line to a level that
is essentially random. The PRA model
includes trigonometric functions of time
to measure the monthly pattern, year effects to measure annual trends, and interaction effects to measure the consistency of the monthly patterns over years.

RESULTS

SEASONAL PATTERNS OF INDIVIDUAL
PREGNANCY OUTCOMES

Table 2 shows the annual number of
each pregnancy outcome included in
our study. The annual number of live
births reported in the vital statistics registry increased over the nine year period. From the hospital based data, used

 

Social Biology

as our data source for the other pregnancy outcomes, the number of spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies increased over the years while
induced abortions decreased and the
number of unspecified abortions remained stable. In our analysis of the seasonality of each pregnancy outcome,
these annual trends have been controlled by normalizing each monthly
value to its thirty-day equivalent and
then computing the monthly percentage
of each outcome for a given year.

Our analysis of these adjusted
monthly values shows that live births,
induced abortions, and unspecified
abortions have significant seasonal patterns (Table 3, Panel A, Row 2). No
significant monthly pattern was detected
for spontaneous abortions or ectopic
pregnancies.

The seasonal model for live births included two harmonic terms that accounted for 94 per cent of the monthly
variance (Table 3, Panels A and C).
Also, the interaction effects (Table 3,
Panel B) were not significant, which suggests that the estimated model was a
good fit year-to-year over the 1974-82
period. The estimated monthly pattern

Induced abortions also have a twoharmonic seasonal model that accounts
for 73 per cent of the monthly variance

and March the peak (Figure 2). This
best-fit pattern, as the pattern for live
births, is consistent over the nine years
studied (Table 3, Panel B).

The seasonal model for unspecified
abortions includes four harmonic terms
that account for 93 per cent of the
monthly variance (Table 3, Panel A and
C). This pattern is more irregular than
the live birth or induced abortion patterns, as it is above average primarily in
February, March, and May, and below

average in June and September through

pattern is also consistent year to year
(Table 3, Pane] B).

SEASONAL PATTERN OF CONCEPTIONS

The seasonal model of conceptions is
a very strong two-harmonic equation
that accounts for 97 per cent of the
monthly variance (Table 3, Panels A

ous abortions nor the ectopic pregnancy
rate had significant month effects. This
indicates that when the monthly pattern
of conceptions is controlled, these rates
show no additional monthly trend. The
year effect (Table 4, Row 1) was not
significant for the rate of spontaneous
abortions but was significant for both
the rate of induced abortions and ectopic pregnancies. The induced abortion rate decreased, while the ectopic
rate rose. .

DISCUSSION

We found that the monthly number
of conceptions in the United States has a
strong and consistent year-to-year seasonal pattern. The above-average time
of occurrence is from October through
January, with November and December
the peak time. This finding is consistent
with the results from several earlier
studies (Kaplan, 1973; Cohen and

et al., 1980; Seiver, 1985). What is new
from our study is the finding that certain
outcomes of pregnancy, especially induced and spontaneous abortions and
ectopic pregnancies, do not have significant monthly variations when the conception pattern is controlled. For all
three outcomes of pregnancy, the
monthly rate for each event is random
across time. That is, the peak and trough
times vary from year to year and the degree of amplitude fluctuates over time.

Our results show no support for the idea
proposed by McDonald (1971) and
Kaplan (1973) that infective agents epidemic in the spring explain the excess of
spontaneous abortions during that time.
Our findings suggest, therefore, that the
monthly variation in induced abortions,
spontaneous abortions, and ectopic
pregnancies will most likely be explained when the seasonal variation in
conceptions is understood.

cause we used a hospital-based data set:

(1) The estimated monthly number
of induced abortions is undercounted in
the NHDS data. The Alan Guttmacher
Institute (AGI) estimates that from
1974 to 1982 in the United States the
percentage of induced abortions that occurred in hospitals declined from almost
50 per cent to 18 per cent (Henshaw et
al., 1984). During the same period, the
annual number of induced abortions increased from 899,000 in 1974 to
1,574,000 in 1982. Results from the AGI
national surveys of abortion providers
(i.e., public and private hospitals, freestanding clinics and private physicians)
show the number of abortions performed in the United States increased
from 1973 to 1980, then remained unchanged from 1981 to 1982. Therefore,
the NHDS data undercount the annual
total number of induced abortions performed in the U.S. and suggest a trend
opposite from that reported using more
complete data. Whether the timing of
the induced abortions not included in
the NHDS differs from those included,
and used in our study, is unknown.

(2) The number of spontaneous abortions also are undercounted in the
NHDS data. It has been estimated that

14 to 43 per cent (Miller et al., 1980) of
all conceptions end in spontaneous
abortions that appear as late or extraheavy menstrual periods. These events
likely would not result in hospitalization
and thus would be excluded from the
NHDS data. Again, as with the missing
induced abortioiis, whether the timing”
of these spontanéotis abortions differ”
from those reported is’ unknown.

(3) The annual'numbet of total abortions included in the NHDS includes a
large number that are ‘‘not specified” as
either induced or spontaneous. The un-*
specified category had a significant seasonal pattern that was different from
that for induced abortions, spontaneous
abortions, or the induced and spontaneous categories combined. Therefore,
the unspecified category appears to be
mixed. Unfortunately, the extent to
which this loss of information affects our
analysis of the seasonality of induced
and spontaneous abortions is unknown.

(4) The extent to which the number
of ectopic pregnancies is undercounted
in the NHDS is unknown. The increasing annual trend found for the rate of ectopic pregnancy is consistent with the
earlier work by Rubin et al. (1983).
They suggested the increase in ectopic

pregnancy is likely a result of the increase in pelvic inflammatory disease in
the United States.

How do our results relate to earlier
studies? The findings for the seasonal
pattern of live births is consistent with
the earlier studies by Rosenberg (1966),
Warren (1978), and Seiver (1985). Live
births in the United States follow a very
distinct seasonal pattern, with July

_through October the above-average

time (August and September peak) and
March and April the primary trough
time. Our findings for the pattern of the
number and rate of induced abortions is
consistent with the study by Cohen and
Bracken (1977). In both studies the
number of induced abortions is above
average in the early months of the year
(January through April). Also, the
monthly rate of induced abortions indicates no additional seasonal pattern beyond that of conceptions. The Cohen
and Bracken study was a count of the
majority of induced abortions in New
York State and New York City from
1970 to 1976. The consistency in the
results from the present study and the
earlier work by Cohen and Bracken suggests the patterns we found are representative of all induced abortions.

Our findings concerning the monthly
number of spontaneous abortions differ
from the earlier studies. Kaplan (1973)
found a significant excess of spontaneous abortions during March through
June. Warren et al. (1980) found a significant seasonal pattern for the number
of spontaneous abortions (above average from January through March and
July and August), but the monthly rate
of spontaneous abortions was not significant. In this study, we found no seasonal pattern for either the number or
the rate of spontaneous abortions.

There are two possible reasons for

Seasonal Variation in Conception

125

these differences. First, Kaplan’s data
base, the Professional Activities Study,
has two design limitations: (a) it undersamples large metropolitan areas, and
(b) it has a potential geographic bias
since 50 of the 126 hospitals included in
the sample were from the North Central
region of the United States. Second, the
difference in the results for Warren et al.
(1980) and the present study probably
relate to the different analysis of ICDA
644 coded events (Not Specified Induced or Spontaneous Abortions). In
the early study, codes 643 and 644 were
combined as an estimate of the number
of spontaneous abortions. This adjustment was based on the assumption that
since most induced abortions occur in
clinics, most of the 644 codes must be
spontaneous abortions. We questioned
this assumption in the present study and
proceeded to look at the seasonal patterns for the two codes separately. Since
the unspecified category had a significant seasonal pattern and the spontaneous abortion category did not, it does
not seem plausible that these two codes
represent the same events. Therefore,
in the present study we kept the two
codes separate. |

What can we can conclude from our
study? In the United States, conceptions
follow a consistent seasonal pattern with
the peak in November and December.
However, when the seasonal pattern for
conceptions is controlled, the monthly
variation for induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, and ectopic pregnancies is not significant. Therefore, we find
no monthly excess for any of these outcomes of pregnancy over that expected
as a consequence of the seasonality of
conception. The reasons for seasonal
variation in the occurrence of conceptions remains to be determined.
