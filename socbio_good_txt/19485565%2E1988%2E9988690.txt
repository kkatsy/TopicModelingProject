on Reported Indices of Parental Power

Among [ranian Adolescents

ABSTRACT: This research investigated the degree to which birth order, number of siblings, and
other family configuration variables such as parental education and material modernity affect
Iranian adolescents’ reports pertaining to differential parental power. Reports of parental
involvement or indices of such involvement in a number of interaction areas were collected from
732 senior high-school students in Shiraz, Iran. An overall index of comparative parental power
was constructed and used as the dependent variable, to be predicted by family configuration
variables. Results indicated that both birth order and family size affected reported power.
Perceived maternal power increased with birth order and decreased with the number of
siblings. These effects remained when pertinent measures of SES, parental education, and
modernity were included in the model. It is concluded that some of the effects of birth order and
family size on social and psychological development of children are probably mediated by their
effects on the intrafamily power structure and communication patterns.

This research explored the effects of
family constellation variables (sex, age,
birth order, number of siblings), and
parental-family variables (education,
occupation, and modernity) on Iranian
adolescents’ perceptions of parental
power. Most of the research on parental
power has been conducted in the United
States, has incorporated a small subset
of these variables, and has addressed parental perceptions. A thorough review
of findings is beyond the scope of this paper. A brief summary follows.

From the research that has involved
adolescent perceptions of parental
power (primarily by McDonald, 1977,
1982), the following conclusions about
perceptions seem warranted: (1) Fathers have greater resource control and
power of an authoritarian nature. (2)
Mothers have greater control in power
that involves nurturance and value
transmission. (3) Both parents have ex
82

pert power in their areas of expertise.
(4) The parent of higher status or with
higher resources is seen as having higher
power (Lueptow, 1980); this parent is
generally the father. (5) While the same
sex parent has greater power, differentiated perceptions maintain across sexes.
(6) Family configuration factors are not
highly predictive, although increased
family size of children has been found to
be associated with increased perceptions of maternal (not paternal) power
(Lueptow, 1980). (7) Parental education and occupational prestige, particularly those of the father, are directly associated with perceived parental power.

Failure to find configuration effects
on adolescent (or parent) perceptions of
parental power seems somewhat surprising, since ordinal position, sibsize,
and spacing have been implicated repeatedly in findings pertaining to childparent relationships. For example, one

can conclude from the literature (cf.
Thompson, 1974; Kidwell, 1981, 1982;
Polit, 1982; Rodgers and Thompson,
1985-1986; and Polit and Falbo, 1987)
that: (1) First- (and/or only-) children
have unique relationships with parents,
and these relationships appear to be associated with both positive (e.g., positive self-regard) and negative (e.g., anxiety) consequences. (2) Second- and
later-borns do not experience the same
intensive interactions with parents nor
the associated positive and negative
consequences. (3) Last-borns experience more (or less) loving and authoritarian control than other later-borns,
but somehow are thought to reap primarily positive consequences from their
status. (4) Middle-borns, being neither
first nor last (although this inference
about last-born status must be questioned), are seen as unique. They presumably experience less parental interaction than either first- or last-borns,
and they suffer consequent negative
self-esteem, although sibsize and sibspacing may attenuate these effects. (5)
With increasing family size (also
thought to be true with decreased child
spacing) there is increased parental control and punitiveness; decreased affection and supportiveness, as well as decreased resources (e.g., time and
money); and more negative psychological consequences for children (such as
competition for parental attention and
satisfaction of dependency needs). (6)
While sex of sibling is apparently not important relative to such perceptions, sex
composition of children is thought to affect parental disciplinary style, parental
control, and parental rule explanation.
In addition to family configuration
factors, certain parental characteristics
are thought to influence parent-child interactions and husband-wife (mother
Iranian Adolescents 83

father) power, and to antecede or interact with variables referred to above. In
particular, parental education and/or
social-economic class appears to mediate family size and parent-child relationships (Tashakkori et al., 1987). Most
commonly, a negative relationship between socioeconomic class and family
size is reported (cf. Higgins et al., 1962).
Increased education of mother is associated with labor force participation and
with increased reproductive spacing
(Groat, et al., 1976). Stycos and Weller
(1967) suggest that the relationships between labor force participation, fertility,
and family size involve role incompatibility, which exists only in cultures in
which there is role conflict between being a mother and the income-earning
role. This hypothesis would suggest that
the negative relationship (employmentchildbearing) may occur in developed
countries, but that minimal role incompatibility would be expected in developing countries. In the United States, increasing family size is associated with
greater paternal control, mainly due to
resource power shifts toward the father
as provider (cf. Scanzoni and Szinovacz,
1980).

It is not a simple matter to develop a
set of predictions about how the factors
cited should affect perceptions of parents in families in developing countries
and whether patterns of relationships
would be expected to parallel at all those
in developed countries. Within developing countries, there are enduring, traditional norms prescribing roles and relationships, in particular concerning the
dominant role of males. While men may
cede certain roles and certain types of
control to wives, such delegation is expected to be in accordance with cultural
prescriptions. For example, fathers are
authority figures in the family, in charge

84 Tashakkori and Thompson

of outcome control (punishment and rewards), and their legitimacy in relation
to the world and work is defined and expected in the family and in the culture.
Mothers are responsible for nurturant,
expressive behavior, with culturally prescribed legitimate control as purveyor of
moral-ethical and normative values and
behaviors.

Being disseminated by the culture,
behaviors, roles, and authority patterns
should maintain across educational or
social-economic classes, although some
attenuation in differentiated power patterns might be expected at higher class
levels. Based on the literature, it might
be expected that family sizes would be
large (sometimes ‘“‘as many as God
gives’’), and that roles and rules for family size and family ordinal position
would exist across classes. Also, greater
male, husband, and father power, and
thus greater father-mother power differentials, particularly in relation to resource control, should be seen in such
settings, in which prescriptions maintain
expectations of such control. Such expectations about family structure and
parent-child relationships across classes
would seem to suggest patterns identified in lower classes or more traditional
subcultures in the West. However, research in the Iranian culture (Tashakkori and Mehryar, 1982; Tashakkori
and Thompson, unpublished) has revealed strongly differentiated perceptions of parental power, despite the
male-dominant nature of the culture
and pervasive beliefs in the powerlessness of the Iranian female.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects were 732 adolescents (409
females and 323 males) enrolled in the
last year (12th grade) of high school in

Social Biology

Shiraz, the capital city of the Fars province of Iran. Ages ranged between 17
and 21, with a mean of 18.0
(SD = 0.920), and with a majority (93
per cent) between 17 and 19. Subjects
were enrolled in 8 schools (4 all-male
and 4 all-female) selected to represent
different SES backgrounds and geographical locations across the city.
Within each school, all 12th grade students completed the questionnaire in
groups. In addition to the 732 subjects
on whom this report is based, 22 respondents reported they did not live with
both parents and were eliminated from
the analysis.

Data were collected in 1982, about 4
years after the Islamic Revolution,
which had created considerable cultural
and political changes in Iran. The data
collection questionnaire contained 85
closed- and open-ended questions. Instructions stressed the scientific nature
of the investigation. Questionnaires
were completed anonymously. Ten
items on the questionnaire measured respondents’ perceptions regarding parents and/or perceived parental involvement with them in various interaction
areas. These questions, completed in an
open-ended format, are presented in
Table 1. Three of the 6 items (Loving
#5, Disappointment #4, and Fear of
#9) addressed feelings regarding parents, rather than reports of parental behaviors or interactions. Since loving is
seen as the best predictor of referent
power (Podsakoff and Schriescheim,
1985), and since fear of parents seems to
represent the degree to which parents
are perceived as having reward/cost
power or outcome-control over the
adolscent, all items in Table 1 can be
considered as indices of general interaction areas with parents and/or indices of
parental power.

. Which parent encourages you more to continue your education?

. If you have a problem that bothers you, which parent do you talk to about it?

. Which parent’s disappointment (regarding what you yourself have done) is more annoying to you?
. Generally speaking, which parent do you love more?

. If you want to consult regarding your future job, which parent will you consult with, or take his/her

7. If you want to make a decision regarding your marriage and selection of your future spouse, which
parent will be consulted FIRST and/or whose opinion will be taken more into consideration?
8. If you do something unacceptable to the family, which parent scolds or punishes you more often?

9. Which parent are you more afraid of?

Responses to these items were coded
as: 1 (father), 2 (both or jointly), and 3
(mother). The sum of these responses
was then calculated and considered as
an index of parental power. The total
power (TPOWER) scores had a possible range of 10 (complete paternal) to 30
(complete maternal). The midpoint of
20 was an indicator of egalitarian style
and/or equality of power. Detailed information regarding the factorial structure of these questions and their correspondence to French and Raven’s
(1959) bases of power are presented
elsewhere (Tashakkori and Thompson,
in press).

Predictor variables included the following family constellation and sociodemographic variables: sex; age; birth order; number of siblings; parental

8 = postgraduate work); respondent
evaluation of own family income (coded
on a 5-point response scale ranging from
very bad to very good); and number of
modern family goods (e.g., radio, TV,
refrigerator, washing machine, and so
on). A sum of modernity items provided
an index (TMODERN) of family (physical) modernity. Table 2 shows the zeroorder correlations between the variables.

the total index of power (TPOWER),
using all the predictor variables mentioned above. Significant predictors of
TPOWER were sex, parental education, number of siblings, and birth order. Education of parents was positively
correlated, but the betas had opposite
signs as predictors of TROWER: TPOWER increased with mother’s education and decreased with father’s education. Since the total index of power was
constructed so that higher means meant
greater maternal power, opposite sign
betas are in line with expectations, indicating that education provides a basis of
power in the family, in partial support of
the resource theory of conjugal power
(cf. Scanzoni, 1979).

For three reasons, a combined index
of parental education is likely to provide
a better predictor than either alone. (1)
Zero-order correlations of each parent’s
education with TPOWER (Table 2)
were rather low. (2) A comparative index would follow from resource and exchange theories of conjugal power and
from McDonald’s (1979) conclusion
that difference in parental education
(‘comparative educational status’’) is a

better predictor of “‘perceived comparative power” of parents (1979, p. 766)
than is either parent’s educational level.
(3) Such thinking might explain the reason why the two betas had opposite
signs here. A _ difference score
(DIFFED) was calculated by subtracting mother’s level of education from
that of the father. Model 2 in Table 2
shows results of regression analysis on
TPOWER using DIFFED instead of individual education. The beta for
DIFFED was negative, indicating that
TPOWER became more maternal as
mother’s education increased in comparison to father’s. Forward regression
analysis indicated that Sex was the best
predictor of TPOWER, followed by
DIFFED, Order, and Nsib.

With regard to Table 3 (Model 1), it
should be noted that, despite the positive correlation between Nsib and Order, signs of betas corresponding to
them in Model 1 were opposite, such
that maternal involvement became
smaller in large families and in interaction with early-borns. When the interaction term was entered in the model, its
beta was not significant, nor was there a
 

 

Vol. 35, No. 1-2

significant increase in R? when the interaction term was added to Models 1 or 2.
Hence, presence of an interaction between Order and Nsib could not adequately explain the opposite-sign betas
for these variables. Rather, effects of
the two are additive. However, each
contributed less to the variance of TPOWER when separate than when together with the other variable in the
w Model. (Note that these same effects
© were found in looking at the interaction
+ of these variables with Sex, although
'g they are not discussed here). A forward
8 regression analysis showed Order enterA ing the model first, with a beta equal to
% 0.11. The minimum tolerance for enterG' ing Nsib, the next largest contributor to
© the variance of TPOWER, was 0.68,
ruling out the possibility of a strong
‘Ss multicollinearity effect. When Nsib was
-= entered into the model (beta = 0.19),
~the change in R, was 0.03,
= F(1,683) = 19.87, p < 0.0001), and the

: That the combination of the two vari© ables (Nsib and Order) had an effect
larger than each separately is, of course,
expected. Each ordinal position represents only the number of siblings born
before (i.e., older than) the respondent;
= it provides no information regarding sib& lings born after (i.e., younger than) the
respondent. Information about laterborns requires a combination of Order
and Nsib. Subtracting Order from the
number of children (Nsib + 1) provides
a later-born index. For further clarification, number of children born after each
subject was calculated in this manner
(henceforth, NAFTER). Regression
analysis on TPOWER using NAFTER
as a predictor is presented in Table 3
(Model 3). Results showed decreased

(ed

maternal involvement with an increase
in number of younger siblings. Lastborns (NAFTER = 0) reported the
greatest maternal involvement (or
power), and first-borns (NAFTER = Nsib) the greatest paternal involvement (or power), especially in
large families. When both NAFTER
and Order were in the model as predictors of TROWER, Order had a beta of
zero; its contribution to the variance of
TPOWER was totally explained by
NAFTER.

To test this general conclusion and to
provide a cross-cultural test of Kidwell’s
(1981) conclusions regarding effects of
birth order on family structure, three
dummy variables were created and used
in regression analyses similar to
Kidwell’s: one (FIRST) compared firstborns (1) with others (0); the second
(LAST) compared last borns (1) with
others (0); and the third (MIDDLE)
compared middle borns (1) with others
(0). Only children (n = 3) were excluded from analyses (cf. Kidwell,
1981). Following Kidwell’s procedure,
three separate regression analyses were
performed, each including one of the
three dummy variables instead of Order
in Model 1 of Table 3 (Model 2 leads to
the same results, so it is not reported).
Results in Table 4 generally show that
effects of Nsib were weaker in these
models than in Models 1-3. Comparison of the three models in Table 4 indicated that firstborns saw less maternal
(more paternal) power than others; last
borns saw more maternal power than
others and middle-borns were not different from the combination of first- and
last-borns. This does not mean that birth
order of the middle-borns did not affect
the family structure. While models 1.1
and 1.3 strongly support the above

mentioned conclusions regarding the
NAFTER index (number of younger
siblings). Model 1.2, testing middleborns in comparison with combined others, cannot be considered an adequate
test of such effects. Further regression
analyses were performed, in each of
which two dummy variables were in the
model to compare each birth order with
one other group. Middle-borns did not
differ from first- or last-borns, which did
differ statistically from each other.
Results of this last set of analyses are explained by Models 1 and 1.1 to 1.3. An
overall conclusion from all these models
might be that differences between different birth orders are gradual, with
mother’s comparative power increasing
with each new child.

In the next step, means were calculated for the first-, middle-, and lastborns, and also within the two sexes. Ignoring Sex, the means of the three
groups were 20.15, 21.89, and 22.23, respectively (F(2,692) = 5.00, p<0.01,
Eta = 0.13). The means for the females
and males were 22.03 and 19.75, respectively (F(1,692) = 38.19), p< 0.0001,

Eta = 0.23). The interaction of Sex and
Order (first, middle, last) was not significant (F(2,692) = 0.76). Within both
sexes, first-borns had the smallest and
last-borns the largest means. Hence, the
smallest (most paternal) mean (19.44)
was present in first-born males and the
largest (most maternal) in last-born females (23.71). Respondents were then
categorized into two groups according
to family size (less than or equal to 4; 5 +
children), and means were calculated
for the 6 (3 Order by 2 Size) groups.
Within both family sizes, the smallest
means were present for first-borns, and
the largest means were found for lastborns. In the total sample, and for firstand middle-borns, the small-family-size
group had a larger mean than the largefamily-size group. Among last-borns,
the mean for those from small families.
That is, last-born of large families reported slightly more maternal power
(mean = 22.78) than did last-borns of
small families (mean = 21.91), who reported more maternal power than other
groups. Despite these differences,
ANOVA did not show a significant inVol. 35, No. 1-2

(F(2,929) = 0.90), or a main effect of

Size (F1,692) = 1.08). The main effect

of Order remained significant
(F(1.692) = 5.91, p <0.01).
CONCLUSIONS

2015

The analyses reveal the following: (1)
5 In support of a resource theory of conju= gal power, perceived parental power is
9 seen to increase with parent’s educaS tion. A comparative index of parental
S education (here, father’s minus moth5 er’s) yields a somewhat clearer predic
“ tion. (2) Number of siblings and birth
S order, as generally calculated, were
§ found to relate in opposite ways with
‘< perceived maternal involvement. Re= ported maternal involvement becomes
= smaller as family size increases, but
> S larger as birth order increases. These ef‘2 fects appeared not to be interactive but
> additive.

The finding pertaining to birth order,
>in particular, appeared somewhat dis3 crepant from much of the research and
3 theory, which suggest that maternal in- volvement is greatest with early-borns.
2 (3) It was thought that the measure for
A birth order might more appropriately be
one which combined birth order and
family size, resulting in an index of number of children born after, rather than
before, a respondent. Using such a measure, the greater the number of younger
siblings, the less was the reported maternal involvement. Again, last-borns reported the greatest maternal involvement; first-borns reported the least
maternai (or most paternal) involvement, particularly in large families. (3)

A direct test was made of Kidwell’s arguments pertaining to middle-borns in
comparison to first- and last-borns.
First- and last-borns were again found to
differ from one another (first-borns reporting less, and last-borns more maternal involvement). However, middleborns did not differ significantly from
either group. These findings do not support Kidwell’s conclusions, but rather
suggest that changes in parental involvement may take place somewhat gradually.

In sum, then, results do show that
there are effects of birth order and family size on perceptions of parental
power. Such perceptions would seem to
be representations of parent-child communication patterns and differential parental involvement in interaction with
adolescents under study. Results tend to
differ from what is generally thought to
be true: that early-borns are exposed to
more, and later-borns to less, maternal
involvement. It may be that this discrepancy from much of the existing literature
is due to the use of perceptions of parental power, rather than, for example, reported closeness to parents. While variables pertaining to affection were
included here, it is parental dominance
within the family that is the primary focus. It seems logical to conclude, as we
have here, that maternal dominance increases with family size and birth order,
while unmeasured closeness to mother
(and/or father) might in fact be related
inversely to family size and birth order.
Thus, as measured, differential involvement of parents in relation to family
size, birth order, and sex of child does
seem to mediate effects of family constellation. Further research, including
research in other cultures, is needed to
test this conclusion.
