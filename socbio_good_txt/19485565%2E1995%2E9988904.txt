ABSTRACT: Using data from the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (1988), this study
investigates the factors that determine the nutritional status of children under five years of age.
Several sociocultural, economic, and demographic variables were selected for the study. These
independent variables were regressed against three proxy measures of malnutrition: height-forage, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height. The results show that the nutritional status of a child
is determined by a variety of factors that are biological, social, cultural, and economic in nature,
namely, birth status, birth weight, diarrhoeal status, duration of breastfeeding, and residence.
The study concludes that most of the factors that account for malnutrition in children in

Zimbabwe are preventable.

Zimbabwe was a British colony until
she attained her independence in 1980.
During that period, there was a great
variation in the distribution of health
problems on the one hand and services
on the other, the most marked characteristic being inequitable geographical
distribution of services and discrimination in access to some. The preventive
and promotive aspects of health services were sacrificed to provide selective high quality curative care for
the few.

After independence in 1980, Zimbabwe worked toward redressing the
inequitable distribution of health services, which is evident in the reduction
of infant mortality rates. Infant mortality rates declined from 84 per 1,000
in 1980 to 61 per 1,000 by 1986 (CSO,
1992).

Despite these gains, malnutrition,
which occurs even in commercial farming areas from which food is exported,

is the major basic health problem in
Zimbabwe. Together with malnutrition, infections account for most infant
and child deaths. Its solution lies with
political, cultural and socioeconomic
changes as well as with active promotion of good feeding practices and provisions of treatment and rehabilitation
through Primary Health Care.

It is against this background that this
study has been undertaken. The study
focuses on adverse socioeconomic factors, infection, and malnutrition for
the following reasons:

(a) A high proportion of Zimbabwe’s population resides in rural areas
which are characterized by poor socioeconomic conditions conducive to malnutrition.

(b) Good nutrition is the basis for
normal growth and development. Unlike most other organs tn the body, the
brain is not fully developed at birth. The
first five years of life are extremely important as the brain may suffer for the

240

rest of life, if the child is not getting
enough good food.

(c) A well-nourished child develops
well both mentally and physically. Since
these children are the mothers and fathers and the labor force of tomorrow,
their well-being is vital to the future development of the country.

(d) A malnourished child is highly
susceptible to infection and disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The main data source used in this
work is the Zimbabwe Demographic
and Health Survey (ZDHS). The survey was conducted by the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) in 1988. The
ZDHS was conducted immediately
after the second round of the Intercensal Demographic Survey (ICDS) of
1987. Its objectives were to collect detailed information on fertility, family
planning, basic indicators of maternal
and child health including infant mortality, and various other topics related
to family health (CSO, 1988).

The three dependent variables for
this study are the three anthropometric
measures, height-for-age, weight-forage, and weight-for-height. Anthropometry offers many advantages over
other indicators of nutritional status.
The foremost is that body measurements are sensitive over the full range
of malnutrition. Data on body measurements are also highly reliable and
are less expensive and easier to obtain
than most nutritional data. Their disadvantages though are their lack of
specificity. Anthropometric data tell us
that there is a problem but reveal very
little about its causes.

The independent variables reviewed
are education of the mother, income,
breastfeeding, weaning procedure,
birth intervals, culture, water and san

itation, family size, rural/urban location, and other causes of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is the dependent variable. The full description of these
variables is given in Table 1.

This study uses multivariate analysis, done with the statistical package
SPSS/PC, using the regression model.
Three logistic regression equations
with dependent variables height-forage, weight-for-age, and weight-forheight standard deviations were run.
The logistic regression takes the multiple regression equation Y;=a+t
bx; + box2 + b3X3....... bx, where
Y; = is the predicted dependent variable HA or WA or WH, a = is the Y
intercept, k = is the number of independent variables, x, = the independent variables, and b; = the slope of
each independent variable (that is, the
amount of change in Y for each unit
change in x; while holding constant the
other independent variables).

LITERATURE REVIEW

In a meeting of the United Nations
in 1990 (The World Summit for Children) it was observed that with present
trends approximately 130 million children will die of disease and malnutrition in this decade (UNICEF, 1991).
At present, one child in every three
in the developing world is prevented
from growing to his or her mental and
physical potential by persistent malnutrition.

A study to determine malnutrition
in children was undertaken in Bindura
between 1980 and 1982 by the Ministry of Health in conjunction with
UNICEF, (Unicef, 1985). From a sample of 1,787 children, it was found that
11.8 per cent were wasted, 29.6 per
cent were stunted, and 22.6 per cent
were underweight.

In surveys undertaken by the Ministry of Health, nearly one-third of
children between 1 and 5 years of age
in communal areas showed definite
evidence of malnutrition (Jayatilaka,
1983). A Harare City Health Department Survey in 1980 of 33,000 children
revealed that 25 per cent showed evidence of undernutrition.

In Zimbabwe’s Demographic and
Health Survey of 1988, children aged 3
to 60 months were weighed and measured to assess their nutritional status.
The study found that 29 per cent of
these children were short in relation to
their age, compared with an international reference population.

Malnutrition in Zimbabwe

Generally, young children in tropical countries tend to suffer from several diseases at the same time, and it
is the synergism between malnutrition
and infection which appears to be
largely responsible for the age pattern
of mortality in children under five. The
high rates of infant and child mortality
now characteristic of much of Africa
will fall almost of their own accord
because of improved levels of living
conditions including better nutrition,
health care, and environmental sanitation. Mortality experience in the West
tends to support this view. There, the
downward trend in infant mortality
started well before there were any
specific therapies available for the
common child-killer diseases.

The historical transition in the West
from high to low infant and child
mortality from infectious diseases
was largely the result of a number of
changes in living patterns which accompany modernization and not primarily because of medical intervention
(UNECA, 1979). Evidently, poverty,
malnutrition, and inadequate health
care account in large part for the high
levels of infant and childhood mortality
in Africa today and will no doubt continue to do so until greater progress is
made in distributing the fruits of modernization throughout the population.

1.1312 show a positive correlation between rural residence and malnutrition. The odds ratio shows rural children 3.1 times more likely to be
malnourished than urban children.

In step two, the child’s birth status is
entered into the regression equation.
The wald statistic of 18.13 shows this
variable to be significant in determining the nutritional status of a child. An
odds ratio of 3.1 shows the likelihood
of becoming malnourished for children
in multiple births relative to single
births.

Child’s birth weight was entered
in step three. The wald statistic was
10.77. This variable was entered into
the equation as a continuous variable.
The odds ratio was 1.00. Because the
variable is continuous, there was no
constant for reference. However, one
may conclude that children with lower
birth weights are more likely to be malnourished than children with normal
birth weights.

Children born less than two years
after their next older sibling are more
likely to be underweight and anemic
at birth. On average, they are almost
twice as likely to die as those born after
a two-year interval.

The variable entered in step four is
the diarrhoeal status of the child. The
wald statistic was 5.13. The odds ratio
of malnutrition for children who had

suffered diarrhoeal bouts relative to
those who did not is 1.4. In other
words, children who suffer from diarrhoea are highly likely to become malnourished compared to those children
who do not.

Variables not entered into the equation are sex of the child, current age of
the child, maternal education, nonagricultural earnings of the father, source
of drinking water, toilet facilities, previous birth interval, duration of breastfeeding, and household number. Sex
of the child is not a significant determinant of malnutrition in children in
Zimbabwe.

Source of drinking water and type of
toilet facilities have not been chosen as
significant variables because they fall
under the umbrella of residence. Residence determines the source of drinking water, toilet facilities, and hence
sanitary conditions. This can also be
said to be true of duration of breastfeeding, household size, and nonagricultural earnings of the father. Urban
residences accommodate fewer members compared to those in rural locations.

WEIGHT-For-AGE MEASURE

The second forward stepwise logistic regression equation uses the weightfor-age measure as the dependent variable as shown in Table 3. A dummy

was created for maternal education
with Category 3 (secondary education
and higher) taken as the reference. In
measuring malnutrition using weightfor-age, we find the most significant
variable entered in step one is maternal education (no education category)
with a wald statistic of 15.21. Children
of mothers with no education have a
likelihood of becoming malnourished
of 2.0, relative to children whose mothers had secondary and higher education.

Residence was the next significant
variable with a wald statistic of 11.26.
A beta coefficient of 0.93 shows the
positive correlation between residence
and malnutrition. The odds ratio of becoming malnourished for children in
rural areas relative to those in urban

areas is 2.5. Urban residence provides 
improved sanitation, clean drinking
water, better sewer systems, and generally results in better health due to
improved personal hygiene.

As shown also by the height-for-age
measure, child’s birth weight was
found to be significant with a wald statistic of 7.91. An odds ratio of 1.00 is
obtained due to lack of a reference category. This variable was entered into
the equation as a continuous variable.
However, its significance cannot be
over emphasized.

Diarrhoeal status of the child was
entered into the equation in step four.
The wald statistic is 4.54. Relative to
children with no diarrhoea, children
with diarrhoea are 1.5 times more
likely to become malnourished. This
finding illustrates the susceptibility to
malnutrition of children who consistently suffer from diarrhoea.

In step five, the child’s birth status
was entered. Single birth was the ref

erence category. A wald statistic of
4.62 confirms this significance. By
weight-for-age, children born in multiple births are highly likely to be malnourished relative to those children
born alone. The odds ratio puts the
likelihood at 2.1 times for children in
multiple births compared to those who
were single births.

The last variable chosen was duration of breastfeeding entered in step
six, which produced a wald statistic of
4.09. Since this variable was entered
into the regression equation as a continuous variable, the odds ratio is 1.00.
There was no constant for reference.
Nevertheless, this analysis has shown
that breastfeeding is an important factor in determining the nutritional status of a child..

The weight-for-age measure left out
sex of the child, current age of the
child, primary education, nonagricultural earnings of the father, source of
drinking water, type of toilet facilities,
preceding birth interval, and household number.

WEIGHT-FoR-HEIGHT MEASURE

Using weight-for-height as the dependent variable, we show the results
of the stepwise logistic regression in
Table 4. Duration of breastfeeding was
the only variable found significant by
the weight-for-height measure with a
wald statistic of 8.76. The odds ratio is
1.00 because it was entered into the
equation as a continuous variable.

All other independent variables
were removed from the equation. For
all three dependent variables, immunization was found to be constant for
all the selected cases. As such, since a
constant was requested in the model, it
was removed from the analysis.

Because it is conceptually difficult
to obtain a single measure for malnutrition, we used three measures. From
the above analysis, we conclude that
the independent variables singled out
by the three dependent variables as
the most significant can best determine
the nutritional status of a child. They
are: birth status of a child, residence,
diarrhoeal status, birth weight, maternal education, and duration of breastfeeding. Of these, the variables which
appeared twice in two different measures of malnutrition are: birth status,
birth weight, diarrhoeal status, duration of breastfeeding, and residence. It
would appear that these variables are
the more significant determinants of
malnutrition.

DISCUSSION

This study attempted to identify factors that determine malnutrition in
Zimbabwe children under age five with

the aim of providing information to
promote effective policies for reducing
the current levels of malnutrition of 25
per cent in urban areas and 40 per cent
in rural areas.

Available data indicate that children
of commercial farm workers are the
most malnourished, followed by children living in communal areas. Children living in urban areas are the least
malnourished. A 1982 survey indicated
that the problem of malnutrition began
at 6 months of age and peaked at 24
months which could be associated with
the beginning of weaning (MOH,
1986). This study also confirmed that
malnutrition starts as early as 6 months
of age with the peak in the 24 to 35
months category.

In spite of food surpluses produced
in Zimbabwe in the recent past, a
large proportion of the rural population produces insufficient food to meet
their needs even without the current
drought. The land tenure system inher
 
 

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

ited by the current government ensured that the majority of the people
subsist on the poorest land. Resettlement programs have been implemented, but the majority of the population still has to be resettled. Incomes
of most people are clearly inadequate
to meet nutritional needs even with the
increased minimum wage.

The proximate and socioeconomic
variables that were selected for the
study were birth weight, sex of child,
age of child, previous birth interval,
birth status, maternal education, nonagricultural earnings of the father,
rural/urban location, source of drinking water and type of toilet facility as
indicators of good sanitation, household number as a proxy for family size,
3 diarrhoeal status, duration of breast& feeding, and immunization status.

The relationships between these
ariables and their impact on the nuritional status of children were examined by applying the forward stepwise
logistic regression analysis. The variables singled out by the multivariate
— analysis (that is, by the three depen& dent variables height-for-age, weight3 for-age, and weight-for-height) as the
= most significant determinants are birth
S weight of the child, birth status of the
& child, diarrhoeal status of the child, du
© ration of breastfeeding, residence, and
maternal education.

Findings from the study showed that
child’s birth weight is an important determinant of the nutritional status of
children in Zimbabwe. The nutritional
status of the mother determines that of
the child. A child born with a low birth
weight is already disadvantaged compared to the one born with a normal or
high birth weight. This disadvantage
was shown in the study when this vari

245

able was singled out as a determinant
of malnutrition in children.

On birth status, the analysis showed
that a child born alone gets more food
resources compared to children tn multiple births. This situation can be worsened if a multiple birth occurs in an
already large family.

The analysis also showed that child’s
diarrhoeal status is a factor in nutritional status. As has been shown by
other studies, we show that a child who
suffers from diarrhoea frequently is
more prone to malnutrition than the
one who does not. In turn, a malnourished child is more prone to diarrhoeal
disease because the immune system is
not strong enough to fight infection.
Hence, there is need to break this vicious cycle if malnutrition is to be reduced in children.

Duration of breastfeeding was another factor shown to be an important
indicator of malnutrition, particularly
during the first six months of life when
the child depends mostly on the mother’s breast milk for food and for defenses necessary for the immune system. During weaning periods children
who did not get enough supplements
were more prone to malnutrition.

Maternal education is an important
determinant of a child’s nutritional
status. Children of mothers without
education have a higher risk of being
malnourished compared to children of
mothers with primary and/or secondary education. However, the longer
the duration of exposure to schooling,
the lower the malnutrition level of children born to these mothers.

Lastly, residence was an important
determinant of a child’s nutritional
status. This result is expected because
type of residence reflects maternal

246

education, source of drinking water,
sanitation, and income. Urban children are less likely to be malnourished
due to better living conditions and
standards compared to their rural
counterparts.

CONCLUSIONS

The nutritional status of a child is
determined by many factors that are
biological, social, cultural, and economic in nature. Even though variables impact on nutritional status in
different ways, it is imperative to note
that these variables are interrelated.
The roots of malnutrition extend beyond the reach and influence of health
and nutrition remedies into the environment, traditions, and economy of
the people. There is no single initiative
or single solution for malnutrition, and
there can be no overall blanket program which will solve the problem.

Hence, a multi-disciplinary approach
is needed to combat malnutrition in
Zimbabwe.

The study also illustrates the complexities inherent in studying malnutrition. The indices used to determine
malnutrition have their own disadvantages. For example, there are factors
that may cause stunting other than
malnutrition. Also, some of the children’s characteristics were provided by
the mothers, and as such the mother
was the ‘“‘case identification’”’ rather
than the child. The latter rendered utilization of the DHS database difficult,
and retrieval was achieved only after
several programs had failed.

Further research is recommended,
in particular, a study using a larger
sample size and using other indices
that measure malnutrition, such as arm
circumstance, so as to validate the findings of this study.
