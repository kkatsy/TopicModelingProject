ABSTRACT: This paper is a study of the determinants of child mortality in the relatively developed Indian state of Goa. Data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS, 1992-93) conducted in the state of Goa have been used to examine the child mortality experiences of 1,331
women who were within a marriage lasting 15 years. An aggregated index of child mortality,
which summarizes the mortality experiences of a woman with exposure adjustment, is the study
variable. Maternal education and longer birth spacing were found to lower child mortality risks

significantly.

Wide regional disparities exist within
India in the levels of infant and child
mortality, being very high in states like
Madhya Pradesh and Orissa and very low
in states like Goa and Kerala.' Goa has an
infant and child mortality profile even
lower than that of Kerala, but unlike Kerala, the reasons for the lower mortality in
the state are little known. Goa is a small
state on the western coast and is relatively better developed than other states
in terms of both infrastructural and social
development. The state was under Portuguese rule for over 450 years until it
was liberated and made a part of Indian
Union in 1961. Goa was one of the Union
territories of India for about 25 years and
attained the status of a state in May 1987.
As a result of Goa’s history, a distinctive
culture has evolved which sets it apart
from the rest of India. Like any other developed country, the state has entered into

‘In 1991, infant mortality rates in Madhya Pradesh
and Orissa were over 110 per thousand births, but under
20 in Kerala and Goa. Similarly, the 0-4 child mortality
were over 35 per thousand in the former and under 10
in the latter.

the last stage of demographic transition
and is ahead of even Kerala in this
process.? It has been demonstrated that
while the Jevel as well as pattern of marital fertility in Goa is comparable with that
of Kerala, there is greater similarity in
mortality pattern between Goa and Portugal (Roy et al., 1985). This paper attempts
to understand the causative factors for the
low recorded levels of child mortality in
Goa. It examines the association of various social, economic, and cultural factors
with child mortality with the help of a
technique for estimating the latter from
data available for women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

Data analyzed are from the National
Family Health Survey (NFHS, 1992-93)

2The state has shown a level of natural increase
with a low level of birth and death rates at about 18.3
and 7.3, respectively, during 1982, and there was a further decline in the former to a level of 14.5 in 1992
(Registrar General of India, 1992).

conducted in the state of Goa. The purpose
of the survey was to assess the levels of
fertility and mortality. In all, 3,141 households were covered and 2,913 currently
married women were interviewed. The
data include: information on the material
and environmental conditions of the
household such as the type of building materials, availability of water, electric supply, and toilet facilities; the basic demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
of the women such as the number of children ever born, the number surviving and
the age at death of those that died, age at
marriage and age at survey, knowledge, attitude toward, and use of contraception,
educational achievement, employment status, place of residence, and religion. —

METHODOLOGY

In this paper, the dependent variable is
an aggregated index of child mortality,
which summarizes the mortality experiences of a woman and is based on the proportion of children that had died out of
those ever born. The index was constructed according to the methodology developed by Trussell and Preston (1982)
and applied in some United Nations studies (United Nations, 1985; 1991).

The index denoted by “M” is the ratio
of the actual proportion of children who
have died to the proportion expected to
die for an “average” woman in the popu
— lation of a particular marriage duration.

Women are classified in different exposure groups on the basis of their duration

3A recent study of child survival in Bangladesh has
used the propostion of children surviving as the dependent variable which happens to be the complement of
the numerator of our dependent variable (see Majumdar
and Islam, 1993).

Social Biology

of marriage; the exposure adjustment is required to avoid the possibility of a longer
exposure to the risk of dying for the children of those mothers who had been married for a longer duration. Thus, for each

woman, “i,” the mortality indicator M; can
be expressed as:

PDE)
M:= Ppe)

where, PD?(e) = the observed proportion
of dead children for woman “7” in exposure
group “e” and PD“(e) = the expected proportion of children dead for a woman in
exposure group “e” if her children’s mortality conformed to the level of the state
(see United Nations, 1991). Across all
women, M should have a mean close to
unity; for an individual woman, a value
above unity indicates that higher than the
expected number of children have died,
whereas a value below unity indicates
lower than the expected number. Finally,
the indicator M is not a conventional measure of mortality but it can easily be converted into the probability of dying by age
3, 599 as, for example, described in United
Nations (1991).

There are three advantages in using this
index. One, only two pieces of information
are required: the total number of children
ever born and number of children surviving.
Thus, it is useful in situations where the date
of each live birth and/or the date of death for
those who did not survive are not available.
Second, it is possible to compare the child
mortality experiences of different groups of
women at a time very close to the survey
point. Third, as the child mortality estimates
refer to the most recent period, it avoids the
problem of relating current household characteristics to mortality events which may
have occurred prior to the current household.

There are a few limitations of the
model. One, only those socioeconomic
factors which have approximately constant
proportional effects at all ages of childhood
tend to get identified. Two, the expected
proportion of children dead is calculated
under the assumption that the distribution
of children by exposure to risk does not
vary systematically according to the covariates used within a marriage duration
group.

The dependent variable is then regressed upon a set of independent variables and the model estimated by Ordinary Least Squares. In this paper, the
sample is comprised of 1,331 currently
married women with at least one live
birth and who are within a marriage duration of 15 years. Restricting the sample to
women of shorter marriage duration ensured that the mortality estimates pertain
to the most recent period before the survey and recall lapse is minimized.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

Factors associated with lowered child
survival are roughly grouped into four:
the environmental and material conditions of the household (proxied by the
type of water supply, availability of toilet
facilities, and the overall standard of Jiving); individual characteristics of the
mother which alleviate or increase the
risks of mortality (educational attainment, work status, and average birth
spacing); the overall development of the
community represented by whether or not
it is urban in character; and religious affiliation to reflect social and culture-specific influences on child survival.4

4Maternal factors which essentially represent the
pattern of childbearing such as age and parity are taken
into account by the choice of sample.

Child Mortality in Goa

The survival of children depends on
the surroundings in which they live. Unsanitary conditions increase the exposure
to disease and morbidity. When the
household living condition is deficient in
space, protected water supply, good sanitation, and sewerage facilities and is exposed to insect attacks, and weather variations, mortality rates tend to be high.
Studies have shown the expected associations between house-building materials,
toilet facilities, and refuse disposal methods (United Nations, 1991). In Nepal,
households with piped drinking water and
access to toilets and electricity were found
to have significantly reduced infant and
child mortality (Gubhaju et al., 1991; Pant,
1991). The importance of piped water in
reducing mortality is underscored by an
analysis of Egyptian data as well (Casterline et al., 1992). Similarly, in Bangladesh,
households with electricity were associated with higher child survival (Majumder
and Islam, 1993). Available evidence for
the states of Rajasthan and Orissa in India
are also consistent with the risk-reducing
effects of electricity and safe drinking water (Kanitkar and Murthy, 1988). The
overall material condition of the household is measured by a composite index of
the standard of living, referred to as the
standard of living index (SLI) of the
household in this paper. The index was
based on different facilities and items
present in the household, such as the structure of the house, source of lighting, and
ownership of various consumer durables.
Households were categorized on the basis
of the standard of living index into three
groups: high, medium, and low. The physical environment of the household is reflected by two dummy variables indicating availability of piped and well-water
supply and toilet facilities, respectively.

104 Rao et al.

Usually, individual characteristics of
parents, especially those of the mother,
are also included in analyses as they may
influence chances of child survival. The
educational attainment and occupation of
the mother are the most commonly used
indicators. The mother’s education has
consistently been found to be a significant determinant (United Nations, 1991).
It has been universally found that maternal education improves the chances of
child survival (Pant, 1991; Bhuiya and
Streatfield, 1992; Tulasidhar, 1993). Educated mothers are considered to take better care of their children as they are more
knowledgeable regarding health, hygiene,
disease causation, and the environment.
Educated mothers may react faster to illness and utilize health services which
leads to earlier treatment. Also, in countries where son preference is predominant, it has been found that education
tends to reduce gender-based treatment
and the gap in survival chances between
boys and girls narrows. The Bangladesh
study reports that for mothers who had at
least five years of schooling, the mortality
risks of girls and boys converged (Bhuiya
and Streatfield, 1992). In India as well,
mother’s education brings about a more
significant difference in the survival
chances of daughters than sons (Bourne
and Walker, 1991).

Other individual characteristics which
have a bearing on child survival are the
mother’s work status and the spacing between her children. The effect of mother’s
employment status on her children’s survival is ambiguous; while the absence of
the mother can be detrimental to the child
in terms of care received, the income derived from her work are hypothesized to be
utilized in those goods and services which
are beneficial to the child. The importance

 

Social Biology

of child spacing in reducing infant and child
mortality has been repeatedly stressed in
various studies (Gandotra and Das, 1988;
Srivastava, 1990; Curtis and McDonald,
1991; Hobcraft, 1992; Miller et al., 1992).

Educational attainment is measured by a
four-category variable. Illiterate women and
those with no formal schooling formed the
reference group; women with 1-4 years of
schooling, 5-7 years, and 8 or more years
of schooling formed the other three groups.
These groupings roughly correspond to the
levels of primary, middle school and high
school and above, respectively. Women
were also distinguished by whether they
were engaged in any wage-based work;
those who were either engaged in household work or working without wages, were
categorized as non-working. The variable
birth interval of a woman is approximated
by averaging all her previous birth intervals
and categorizing into two, viz., birth interval 2 years or Jess and birth interval above 2
years to assess the impact of short birth interval on child mortality.

Since rural-urban differentials in mortality experience usually exist in developing countries, such a distinction has been
made in this study as well. In addition,
since differentials can also exist among
various cultural and social groups and
since Hinduism and Christianity are the
two major religions in Goa, we included
two dummy variables to account for any
cultural difference arising out of religious
affiliation.

RESULTS

About 8 per cent of the women had
experienced child death, with 0.9 per cent
having Jost more than one child. In this
section, we first discuss the level of child
mortality among women from various so

cioeconomic backgrounds; next we present the multivariate results.

Among the household characteristics,
as expected, environmental conditions are
associated with risks of child mortality.
For example, mortality before age 5
among children from households without
a toilet is more than 3 times that of those
children from households having toilets
(see Table 1).

Standard of living of the household to
which the children belonged was inversely
related to child mortality. The probability
of dying of children from low SLI households was 6 times that of those who came
from the highest SLI households. Similarly, the chance of dying by age 5 among
children from middle SLI households is
about 3.5 times that of those from the
households of the highest SLI.

The greatest differentials in ,¢, among
various categories of one variable can be
seen for mother’s education. The risk of
dying by age 5 decreased sharply as maternal education rose, where <q, of chil
dren whose mothers had primary-level |

education, middle-level education, and at
least high-school education were estimated as 46.5, 18.5, and 16.6 per 1,000
children, respectively. The estimated 54
of children whose mothers had no education was as high as 117 per 1,000 population of children. Speaking in relative
terms, these values of mortality suggest
that children of illiterate mothers had a
probability of dying which was at least
seven times higher than that of children
whose mothers had at least a high-school
education. Children whose mothers had a
primary education were about three times
more likely to die by age 5 than were the
children of mothers with a high-school
education. For children whose mothers
had middle school education, though the

105

chance of mortality decreased, the relative difference being only 1.1 times that
of high-school-educated mothers.

The working status of the mothers
seems to affect child survival; children of
working mothers have a slightly lower
mortality than those whose mothers were
not working. As expected, child mortality
decreases with the gradual elongation of
the interval between successive births. It
is higher if the average length of birth interval is less than two years, being about
1.5 times that of children who have been
born after longer intervals. Child mortality in urban areas is higher than that in
rural areas. It also tends to be about 1.25
times higher among Hindu women.

THE MULTIVARIATE MODEL

The mortality index “M” which indicates the risk of a woman’s children dying before age five was regressed upon
the same set of independent variables
proxying the environmental and material
conditions of her household, her individual characteristics, and her cultural background. The independent variables were
introduced in two steps to highlight the
mechanisms by which mortality is affected. Also, the rationale was that poor
chances of survival in an unfriendly environment can be compensated for by behavior which reduces these risks. Following this logic, in the first step, all the
variables reflecting the material and cultural conditions of the household (socioeconomic status, availability of water and
toilet facilities, place of residence, and
religious affiliation) were introduced; the
second step extended the first by including the individual characteristics of the
woman which can shape the mortality experiences of her children (her education,
work status, and average birth interval).

The first stage of the model indicated
that compared to children from poorer
households, those from relatively better
socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have
significantly Jowered risks of mortality
(Table 2). Compared to households with a
low standard of living, the risk of dying

for children of women from a medium
standard of living is about 40 per cent
less; the risk of dying further falls to less
than a quarter for children from a higher
standard of living. More importantly, access to a toilet is a significant factor in reducing mortality; the risk of dying in

improves. The second point to observe is
that rural-urban differentials are significant. In fact, surprisingly, there is a low
level of mortality in rural residences. Finally, it is also clear that belonging to any
religious group per se has no significant effect on childhood mortality.

In the second stage of the model, on the
inclusion of variables measuring educational attainment, work status, and birth
spacing, some of the variables introduced
earlier change in magnitude and significance; also, the relative risks alter. The
household environment variables become
insignificant as the mortality reducing ef
fects of maternal education and birth spac
ing operate.

The higher the level of a woman’s educational attainment, the greater are the
chances of her children surviving. It appears that some schooling does reduce
mortality risks. Children of illiterate
women compared to those whose mothers
had studied up to middle school are significantly less likely to survive. Compared to
illiterate women, the mortality risks of children of women who have had up to primary school level of education is reduced
to about 65 per cent, while that of children
of women who are in the middle school
level tends to be a sixth of the reference
group. While further increases in education
are associated with reduced mortality risks,
the importance of education diminishes. In
other words, the threshold level of education before mortality risks decline seems to
be within eight years of schooling. Finally,
consistent with our hypothesis, we find that
long birth intervals are significantly assoctiated with reduced mortality risks. We find
that child spacing is significantly negatively associated with child mortality. It
appears that child spacing acts and interacts with child mortality through some in

termediate variables, mainly the practice
of breastfeeding by the mothers.

CONCLUSIONS

Like other studies, this study reiterates
the importance of maternal education and
the length of the birth interval in improving the survival chances of children. That
education of the mother is a significant
factor even in Goa, which has fairly high
levels of female literacy, is an important
finding. However, there is a suggestion of
a weakening of the education-child mortality relation with increases in the level
of education. Though there was no attempt to study the mechanisms through
which education reduces mortality risks,
there are some indications that educated
women tend to adopt certain behaviors
which compensate for an unhygienic and
unsanitary environment. For example,
when maternal education is omitted from
the analysis, the material-conditions of
the household and the availability of a
toilet assume significance.

A recent review by Hobcraft (1993) identifies three direct pathways through which
education improves child survival (a)
through better hygiene and personal care; (b)
through better utilization of health services;
and (c) through greater emphasis on child
quality. Educated women tend to keep their
surroundings cleaner and hygienic; they are
likely to adopt personal care habits such as
boiling water for drinking and washing
hands with soap after defecation. Such behaviors tend to minimize the risk of infection and disease.> Educated women are

5However, we should note that the behavior of educated women need not be based on their being know}edgeable about disease classification or causation (see
Cleland, 1990).

able to process health information better
and are thus able to prevent most childhood diseases. In the event of their children
falling ill, they are quicker to respond and
utilize health services more effectively
and efficiently. Finally, these women are
more likely to feed their children hygienically prepared and nutritious foods. This
effect compensates for any detrimental
effect of shortened breastfeeding among
educated women.

Finally, we would like to make a comment about the technique used. A number
of studies have found that infant and child
deaths tend to be clustered in some fami

lies (see Das Gupta, 1990). This finding
has led to new and sophisticated analytical
methods for estimating child mortality by
avoiding sibling correlation (Curtis et al.,
1993; Guo, 1993). In such models, a child
is the unit of analysis, and its survival
chances are posited to be a function of various factors of interest. The technique used
in this paper, notwithstanding its limitations, is a simpler way to test the various
explanations for death clustering, be it maternal competence or the various biological, social, physical, and environmental
factors, as it summarizes a woman’s child
mortality experiences.
