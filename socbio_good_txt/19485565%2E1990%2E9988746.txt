More on the Determinants
of the Fertility Transition

ABSTRACT: The economic approach to fertility is an application of the economics theory of
consumer behavior. It is assumed that consumers of children are utility-maximizers with stable
preferences over time. Thus, changes in fertility are related to changes in household income and
the “price” of children. One concern in this approach is that demographic changes are a
product of changes in tastes rather than exogenous changes in economic factors such as the
earning ability of women. In this paper, the effect of economic variables on the demand for
children in the United States in 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 is examined. Support is provided for
the hypothesis that the earning ability of women is an important determinant of fertility.

The economic approach to fertility is
an application of the economic theory of
consumer behavior. It is assumed that
consumers of children are utilitymaximizers with stable preferences over
time. Thus, changes in fertility are related to changes in household income
and the “price” of children (Becker,
1981).

This approach to explaining the fertility transition has been called into
question by Blake (1968), Cleland and
Wilson (1987), and others. Cleland and
Wilson (1987, p. 27) argue that “‘the onset of demographic change is more
closely associated with parents’ education and cultural affiliation than with economic factors, such as familial control
of economic life or women’s employment.”

In this paper, the effect of economic
variables on the demand for children in
the United States in 1950, 1960, 1970,
and 1980 is examined. Support is provided for the hypothesis that the earning
ability of women is an important determinant of fertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In lieu of an in-depth review of economic approach to fertility (see Becker,
1981), key concepts that are relevant to
this paper are briefly reviewed. The
most salient economic finding is that fertility is negatively related to female
earnings (see Becker, 1981; Butz and
Ward, 1979; Sander, 1986; Schultz,
1985). Whereas female earning ability
increases the “price” of children, since
they are female-time-intensive products, male earnings increase the demand
for the quantity and quality of children
(see Becker, 1981, pp. 103-112). Thus,
the positive effect of male earnings on
the demand for quantity may be partly
offset by the demand for quality (e.g.,
investments in schooling) making the
male earnings (income) effect ambiguous. Other factors that increase the
price of children such as urbanization
should reduce fertility, as well.

Estimates of the number of children
ever born to women age 35 to 44 in 1980
are presented for four periods: 1950,

1960, 1970, and 1980. Fertility is measured per woman rather than per
woman married because the marriage
rate is also a function of some of the
same determinants of fertility (see Becker, 1981). Thus, the effect of economic factors on fertility may be both direct and indirect. Data are at the state
level (excluding Alaska and Hawaii).

For the estimates of fertility, median
income of males and females 35 to 44 are
used as proxies for male and female
wages, respectively, for 1950, 1960, and
1970. Mean earnings of males and females 35 to 44 employed at least 40
weeks in 1979 are entered to adjust for
male and female wages for 1980. The
above are used as proxies for the actual
wage rates because average state wage
rates for men and women are not available over time. Female earnings are entered to adjust for the effect of the value
of female time on the demand for children. Male earnings are entered to capture the income effect. Male earnings
are used rather than family income because family income is related to the labor market status of women which, in
turn, is a function of fertility.

Since female earnings may be endogenous with fertility (Sander, 1986;
Schultz, 1985), an estimate of female
earnings is used in the fertility regressions. Estimated earnings is based upon
the industry-mix in a state derived as fo)lows.

Following Bowen and Finegan
(1969), I constructed a female-industrymix variable for the 48 states used. First,
I broke down employment into 25 industrial categories for 1950 and 1960 and
34 categories for 1970 and 1980. These
categories accounted for all of the employed workers in the United States (see
Tables 1 and 2). Second, IJ calculated
what per cent of the workers in each cat
Fertility Transition 53

egory were female. Third, I calculated
how many women would be employed
in each industry at the state level if the
state conformed to relative employment
levels for women at the national level.
For example, if 10 per cent of workers in
agriculture at the national level are
women, 10 per cent of the jobs in agriculture at the state level are allocated to
women. The total number of jobs that
are allocated to women in a state are
then divided by the total number of jobs
in the state to derive the femaleindustry-mix variable. Thus, one derives a measure that can be used to predict the demand for female workers in a
state. The relationships between female
earnings and the industry mix (IM) and
female work and the industry-mix are
shown in Table 3.

It is recognized that the wage variables are imprecise measures of the value

of time, particularly for females. One of
the problems with the measure is that labor supply decisions affect their levels,
particularly for 1950, 1960, and 1970.
This is a particular problem for females
because female labor supply decisions
tend to vary relative to males. Thus,
whereas male labor supply can be assumed to be independent of fertility, female labor supply is endogenous with
decisions regarding family size. Although it would be preferable to have
better measures of wage rates, they are
not available at this level of aggregation
during earlier periods.

Another problem with the data is
that the proxies that are used for wages
do not precisely reflect the value of time
when decisions regarding children are
being made. I would note, however,
that if one lags the wage rates by a decade, the results do not appreciably
change.

To provide another test of the hypothesis that female earning ability has a
negative effect on fertility, the estimated female wage is replaced by an estimate of the labor force participation
rate for females age 35 to 44. Since female labor supply decision is endogenous with fertility, as noted above, an
estimate of it that is also based on the
industry-mix in a state will be used.

Adjustments are also made for population density and per cent living in urban areas, since the price of children
may be affected by location. On one
hand, the cost of children may be higher

in more urbanized and densely popu- tion, as well. During earlier periods of
lated states because of, for example, time, it has been argued that schooling
higher housing costs. However, the cost quality was superior in urban areas relaof child quality may be affected by loca- _ tive to rural areas (Schultz, 1967). Thus,

the price of child quality would be
higher in rural areas relative to cities.
More recently, evidence indicates that
schools in large cities tend to be relatively inferior (Schultz, 1981), thus increasing the price of quality (and decreasing the price of quantity) of city
children. This implies that the effect of
location on fertility is ambiguous and
may vary over time. In addition, it has
been shown that fertility is higher
among farmers (Sander, 1986). Since
the per cent in farming tends to be
higher in less urbanized, more sparsely
populated states, the density and urban
adjustments tend to pick up the farm effect, as well. In preliminary work with
the data, I could not separate out a farm

effect. Also, in preliminary work with
the data I could not separate out a female schooling effect. Since female
schooling and per cent in farming have
no bearing on the results, they are excluded in the empirical analysis.

‘ficient is negative in 1950 and 1960, and
positive in 1970. The male wage coef
Gicient is not significant in 1980. The female wage and work coefficients are
negative and significant in all years esti
mated. Population density is found to °

have a significant negative effect on fertility in 1960 and 1970. The urban coefficient is only negatively significant for
1970.

In Table 8, elasticities at point means
are presented for the female wage and
female work effects. For the female
wage, the elasticity is estimated at 0.4

for 1950, 1960, and 1970 and 0.8 for
1980. The substantial change in 1980
may reflect the different (and better)
measure of the female wage for that

year. Thus, in 1980 a 10 per cent increase in the female wage reduces fertility by 8 per cent. The substantial negative effect of female earning ability on
fertility is also confirmed by the female
work elasticity. A 10 per cent increase in
the labor force participation rate for
women 35 to 44 reduces fertility by 6 to 7
per cent.

CONCLUSIONS

My results for the four periods under
study support the hypothesis that economic factors, particularly the earning
ability of women, affect fertility. Thus,
changes in fertility over time appear to
be substantially related to changes in the
economic value of female time. An increase in the earning ability of women
increases the price of children and reduces fertility. This result does not preclude other factors from being important, as well.

 

Social Biology

The male wage results are more of a
puzzle. Ina related study, the male wage
(income) effect was found to be positive
during the 1970’s (Rosenzweig and
Schultz, 1985). Thus, my results for 1970
are consistent with this finding. A speculative interpretation of the negative
coefficients for 1950 and 1960 is that income may have increased the demand
for child quality (thus increasing the
price of children) relative to number of
children during earlier periods. It is
more difficult to explain the lack of an
effect in 1980. The changing effect of income over time on the demand for children is a topic that merits additional research.
