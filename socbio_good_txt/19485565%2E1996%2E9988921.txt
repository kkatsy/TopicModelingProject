ABSTRACT: The prevalence of cigarette smoking in the United States has declined over the past
few decades. However, some leveling-off in prevalence rates has been observed in recent years,
and the rate for teenagers and young adults has even turned upward. This paper considers four
alternative scenarios of future cigarette smoking patterns in the United States for the population
25 and over and measures the impact these different scenarios would have on excess mortality
due to smoking and on the sex and age distributions of deaths. Scenarios reflecting higher levels
of smoking prevalence produce considerably more deaths than scenarios tied to lower levels. As
many as two and one-half million excess deaths would take place in the decade of the 2020’s if
a high prevalence, rather than low prevalence, assumption proves correct. Even when a constant
prevalence, assumption proves correct. Even when a constant prevalence assumption is compared with a moderately-declining prevalence assumption, as many as one million excess deaths
would be generated during that decade alone. Lowering smoking prevalence rates would also
change the population sex ratio by reducing deaths for males more than deaths for females, and
by contributing to the aging of the population. The results are interpreted in terms of the overall
impact of smoking on mortality and with regard to public and private policy decisions related
to cigarette smoking.

 

Although tobacco was a major agricultural crop in the United States
from the earliest times in the country’s
development, users of tobacco in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
were more likely to chew it or smoke it
in cigars than to smoke it in cigarettes.
Those who were cigarette smokers
were most apt to roll their own, since
manufactured cigarettes had not yet
become widespread. The production
of manufactured cigarettes in the
United States began to climb sharply
early in the twentieth century and
reached a peak in the middle of this
century (U.S. Public Health Service,
1956).

The cigarette smoking prevalence
rate for men reached 54 per cent by the

early 1950’s and has since declined
steadily to about 25 per cent. For some
cohorts of men, as many as 66 per cent
of them smoked cigarettes when they
attained young adulthood. The cigarette smoking prevalence rate for
women, who tended to take up smoking much later than did men, reached
well over 30 per cent by the mid-1960’s
and has likewise fallen to about 25 per
cent. For some cohorts of women, the
rate reached 44 per cent by young
adulthood (Cowell and Hirst, 1980;
National Cancer Institute 1991; National Center for Health Statistics,
1994). The trends in cigarette smoking
prevalence by age since 1955 are shown
in Figure 1 for men and Figure 2 for
women.

The apparent decline in cigarette
smoking in recent decades is generally
attributed to admonitions from the
Surgeon General about the health hazards of smoking and the subsequent
strong campaigns to get smokers to
quit. While these campaigns seem to
have been very successful, studies done
within the past few years have recorded a rise in the smoking habits of
teenagers (CDC, 1995; Nelson et al.,
1995) and plateaus in the smoking
prevalence of adult men and women
(CDC, 1994). These changes are reflected in Figures 1 and 2, where the
general decline in smoking as well as
the more recent upturns and age- and
sex-variations can be observed.

Research done by us and others has
strengthened the conclusion that cigarette smoking, especially heavy smoking, leads to a high risk of premature
death (Nam, Rogers, and Hummer,
1994; Doll et al., 1994). Based on our
analysis of data for the 1986 period,
among persons reaching age 25, those
who never smoked lived 18 years
longer than those who were continuing
heavy, smokers. Quitters and those
who smoked lightly had intermediate
ages at death. Even when demographic, socioeconomic, and other
health risk factors are introduced into
the analysis, the fatal consequences of
smoking persist. With those factors
controlled, the odds ratio of dying during the 1985-87 period was over twice
as great for continuing heavy smokers
as for never smokers and nearly four
times as great for late quitters as for
never smokers (Hummer, Rogers, and
Nam, 1995).

What does this portend for the future? What are likely to be the mortality consequences of future smoking

patterns? In this paper, we estimate
the long-run outcomes by assuming
four different future smoking scenarios
and calculating the number of deaths
that would result—and consequent sex
and age patterns of death—by decennial years up to 2050.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The four smoking scenarios are labeled high, upper medium, lower medium, and low, and are based on varying assumptions about future trends in
smoking prevalence specific to sex and
age categories for persons 25 and over.
The assumptions are:

High. — Rates increase to 1983 agesex-specific levels by 2000 and remain
at that level until 2050. This assumption reflects the recent increases in
smoking prevalence rates among
young people. Since 1983 levels are
only moderately higher than levels of
recent years (see Figures 1 and 2), this
is a conservatively high assumption.

Upper medium.— Age-sex-specific
rates remain at 1992 levels until 2050.
This is essentially a constant assumption, which reflects recent leveling off
of adult prevalence rates and a position
that one-fourth of the adult population
will remain smokers regardless of efforts to have them quit. The constant
levels can be used as a base against
which to measure the effects of the
other three assumptions.

Lower medium. —Age-sex-specific
rates of decline between 1983 and 1992
are extrapolated to 2050. This assumption is predicated on the notion that recent upturns in smoking prevalence are
temporary departures from a trend,
and that further reductions in smoking
prevalence are possible. The decline

experienced in the 1983-92 period was
moderate and gradual, so that continuation of that level of. decline will result
in a substantial minority of remaining
smokers by the year 2050.

Low. —Age-sex-specific rates fall
linearly to zero by 2020 and remain at
that level. This assumption is based on
the possibility that cigarette smoking
can be completely eliminated within
the next quarter of a century and
emerge again. Although probably not
highly realistic, this assumption can
also be used as a base against which to
measure the other three levels of
smoking patterns.

Smoking prevalence rates distinguish between those who currently
smoke and those who do not. We further divided these categories by differentiating the prevalence rate between
current light smokers (less than a pack
a day) and current heavy smokers (a
pack or more per day), and the nonprevalence rate between never smokers and quitters (with quitters further
differentiated according to how long
since they quit). This last distinction
was found in our research to be critically related to mortality risks. The
subcategories were estimated by assuming that the relative distribution of
them within each age-sex group in the
1985-97 NHIS surveys remained constant over time.

The result of the several assumptions was a set of tables (not presented
here) showing by sex, age, decennial
year, and smoking-prevalence scenario, the percentage distribution of
persons by smoking status. The numbers related to each percentage (shown
in Table 1) were derived by multiplying
the percentages by the corresponding
medium-assumption population pro

jections by age and sex for each year

according to the U.S. Bureau of the
Census (Day, 1993). The associated
number of deaths expected in each cell
was determined by multiplying the
population numbers by the age-sexsmoking status-specific mortality rates
generated from the 1985-87 study
(Hummer, Rogers, and Nam, 1995).
These rates were assumed to remain
constant over time. Consequently, the
only variables in this analysis are the
alternative temporal smoking scenarios and the changing population size by
age and sex.

Clearly, this model is oversimplified
for projecting deaths related to smoking in the future. We do not allow for
variations in several of the conditions
we specify, and we do not take into account such variables as causes of death,
the interactions among variables, and
possible changes in the nature of smoking habits (such as increasing or decreasing the volume of smoking or altered patterns of inhaling). We also do
not allow for lag times between smoking and mortality. Nevertheless, our
results should give a good preliminary
indication of the mortality consequences of alternative smoking trends.
We intend to elaborate the model at a
later time and to see if the results
change significantly.

RESULTS

This paper examines mortality between 1990 and the middle of the next
century in terms of differences generated by varying patterns of cigarette
smoking. We analyze the impacts of
four alternative smoking trend scenarios on: (1) the number of expected excess deaths due to variations in

cigarette smoking, (2) the extent of excess male mortality due to such variations, and (3) differences in the age distribution of deaths resulting from
varying smoking patterns.

Previous studies have determined
the total number of deaths attributed
to cigarette smoking (Peto et al., 1992;
National Center for Health Statistics,
1994; Bartecchi et al., 1995; Thun et
al., 1995). Most such estimates for the
United States in recent years put the
number above 400,000.

The objective of our analysis is not
to recreate such an estimate, but rather
to discover how many deaths would
take place under different smoking regimes. Differences in the number of
deaths for the several smoking scenarios provide estimates of the effect of
varying assumed smoking trends in the
population. Thus, in Table 2, we estimate differences in the number of
deaths as a consequence of the U.S.
adult population following the smoking trend implied by the High assumption as opposed to the Low assumption
and as implied by the Upper Medium
assumption versus the Low Medium
assumption.

Using the High/Low comparison,
we find an excess of roughly 85,000
deaths in the year 2000 if the High, as
opposed to Low, scenario takes place.
By the year 2020, the annual discrepancy reaches almost 240,000 deaths; by
the year 2050, the single-year disparity
approaches 500,000 deaths. The High
and Low assumptions represent extremes in that the High assumes some
rise from the present in smoking prevalence while the Low assumes rapid
reduction in smoking prevalence to a
zero point by 2020. We, therefore, introduced a much more conservative

Cigarette Smoking

161

comparison—that of the Upper Medium versus Lower Medium assumptions. This comparison gives the answer to the question of how many
excess deaths there would be if specific
smoking rates remained constant as
opposed to declining at a modest rate.
In this case, 24,000 more deaths would
take place in the year 2000 if the rates
stayed constant, and this disparity
would rise to almost 100,000 more
deaths annually by 2020 and about
168,000 annually by 2050.

Since the previous estimates are
for individual years only, we also estimated the excess number of deaths
each decade according to each comparison of assumptions (Table 3). Given
the High/Low comparison, about
three-quarters of a million excess
deaths would occur during the first decade of the next century if the High assumption was met, and this number
would increase to nearly four million
by the decade of the 2040’s. Comparing the Upper Medium and Lower Medium assumptions, about 428,000 excess deaths would take place in the first
decade of the next century if the Upper
Medium assumption held up, and this
number would rise to over one and
one-half million by the decade of the
2040's.

What are some of the demographic
impacts of the variations in deaths associated with each smoking scenario?
Because females live longer than
males, there are proportionately more
females who die at the older ages.
Thus, we focus here on the change in
the sex ratio rather than the sex ratios
themselves. Our aim is to determine
whether smoking contributes to the
masculinization or feminization of
death at different ages. Table 4 shows

clines in smoking would have the effect
of reducing deaths to males more than
deaths to females.

The age distribution of deaths is
likewise affected by the course of
smoking prevalence. Apart from the
fact that the adult population will age
more rapidly in the future because of
basic demographic changes, lowering
of smoking prevalence will accelerate
that population-aging process by shifting ages at death to later points in the

than women.

The fact that patterns of sex ratios
and age distributions both change with
variations in smoking patterns indicate
that the demographic and smoking
variables are synergistically related.

CONCLUSIONS

Cigarette smoking has been definitely linked to a higher risk of premature death, and this risk is greatest for

those individuals who continue to
smoke heavily and those who stopped
smoking but only after they presumably had incurred a serious illness. The
greater the prevalence of cigarette
smoking in the future, the greater will
be the expected number of deaths in
the population which occur prematurely. In this paper, we estimated the
number of such excess deaths for the
adult population in future years using
four scenarios of future trends in smoking prevalence within categories of sex
and age. We also determined the extent to which the sex-age composition
of the adult population would be affected by the alternative smoking scenarios.

We find that the number of excess
deaths generated by comparing scenarios representing higher and lower levels of smoking prevalence are substantial. To illustrate, when we compare
the scenario that allows for a slight rise
in current smoking prevalence with the
scenario that assumes a decline in prevalence to a zero point by the year 2020,
we find a difference of about 85,000
deaths in the year 2000, and the excess
number rises to a quarter of a million
deaths in the year 2020, and to one-half
million in the year 2050. This scenario
translates into three-quarters of a million excess deaths during the first decade of the next century, two and onehalf million excess deaths in the decade
of the 2020’s and almost 4 million excess deaths in the decade of the 2040’s.

One might question the choice of
comparisons since they are based on
extreme, although possible, assumptions. We thus shifted our comparisons
to a more conservative basis by comparing the two medium smoking-prevalence assumptions—one that regards

Cigarette Smoking 165

smoking prevalence as remaining constant and one that allows for a continuing modest decline in smoking rates.
Based on this set of comparisons, we
find a difference of over 24,000 deaths
in the year 2000, and the excess number rises to almost 100,000 by 2020 and
to almost 168,000 by 2050. Over a decade, this would mean about 428,000
excess deaths in 2000-09 if prevalence
rates do not continue their decline, and
this number would increase to over 1.1
million excess deaths in the decade of
the 2020’s and over 1.6 million excess
deaths in the decade of the 2040’s.

The effects of the varying smoking
scenarios on the sex and age composition of the adult deaths is less dramatic, but significant. Lower smoking
prevalence rates would change sex
ratios in the population by reducing
male deaths more than female deaths
at each age. It would also shift deaths
from younger to older adult ages,
thereby contributing further to the
aging of the population that is already produced by basic population
dynamics.

The projection model developed
here is based on the Census Bureau’s
medium assumption and overlooks a
range of potentially complicating variables that could alter the results we
have obtained. These variables encompass other changing population characteristics that differentiate smoking
habits, as well as alterations in the
types of cigarette smoking and in the
frequency and intensity of smoking.
We have distributed the smoking status
populations according to the Census
Bureau’s projections, and then determined the resulting mortality rates.

An alternative approach to applying
the derived mortality rates to the

166 Nam et al.

Census population projections would
have been to substitute our mortality
assumptions for the ones used by the
Census Bureau in their projections,
and then see how future population
age and sex composition would be affected. This substitution may result in
somewhat different numbers of estimated deaths by smoking category.

Another option would be to use
multistate analysis to project separately each smoking status subpopulation. The multistate approach would
begin with the population distributed
by smoking status and provide mortality rates by status, but allow individuals
to either stay in one status or to move
to other statuses. This alternate approach, while potentially yielding less
accurate population counts, would increase the effects of smoking on mortality by cumulating high mortality
risks on a concentrated subpopulation
of smokers and thereby statistically increase mortality among males, leading
to a greater gender gap, and mortality
at the younger ages, further retarding
the aging of the population. Unfortunately, the multistate approach requires smoking status transitions and
explicit assumptions about migration,
fertility, and smoking status distributions below age 25.

We believe that the variables accounted for in our model—differing
smoking prevalence rates by sex and
age, distinctions among current and
former smokers, and reasonable population projections by sex and age—
lead to fairly robust estimates of persons by smoking status in future years.
Elaboration of the model would give
the estimates greater specificity, but it
is unlikely that it would alter them
greatly. Thus, our findings can be used

Social Biology

as general estimates of the effects of
smoking on future age and sex distributions of deaths and on overall mortality, and as baseline numbers for future estimates of the effects of smoking
using different approaches, including
the multistate approach.

What implications do these findings
have for understanding the overall impact of cigarette smoking on mortality?
It is clear that lower levels of cigarette
smoking in a population, have the effect of sharply reducing the number of
“excess deaths” that would obtain if
higher levels of smoking were in force.
Because of the widespread nature of
cigarette smoking, even allowing for
declines in recent decades, the numbers of smokers in the United States
are substantial, and any reduction in
the smoking prevalence rate would
lead to many fewer deaths at a younger
given age. The type of projected future
estimation of smoking patterns an their
mortality consequences presented here
adds to the evidence that smoking ts a
major component of the national mortality picture for adults.

What implications do these findings
have for public and private policy decisions related to cigarette smoking?
The emphasis placed on smoking prevention by public health agencies is
clearly justified by this and other research. People who have never smoked
have the lowest mortality risks in the
population. Quitting smoking is beneficial for survival prospects, although it
may not be beneficial if a smoker quits
only after a serious illness is incurred.
For those who cannot quit smoking, a
significant reduction in the number of
cigarettes smoked would serve to
lessen mortality risks. The net result of
efforts to bring about these shifts will

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

be to ‘“‘save lives” that otherwise would
be lost prematurely because of the
smoking habit.

In addition, policies and programs
must be directed toward the adolescents and young adults who will compose these future scenarios. Slight increases in the prevalence of cigarette
smoking among young people in the
1990’s can contribute to higher mortality among the elderly in 2050. Thus,
strong efforts must be made to convince adolescents and young adults to
refrain from smoking. These efforts
may take the form of stronger educational programs and restrictions on cigarette advertising and sales to minors.
Because of the long latency periods related to smoking and morbidity, disability, and death, today’s preventive
efforts can increase life expectancies
fifty years from now.

The private sector can facilitate
changes in smoking habits by maintaining and extending restrictions on smoking in work situations and encouraging

Cigarette Smoking

167

employees not to smoke elsewhere. In
particular, tobacco companies and cigarette manufacturers should be more
forthright in telling potential smokers
about the health and mortal risks of
smoking.

If these policy pronouncements and
actions are made boldly enough, the
result would be that the numbers of
early deaths indicated by the higher
smoking prevalence assumptions in
our analysis would not likely be realized and that individuals in the United
States would see their health improve
and their average years of life
lengthen.
