The One-Person Household
in Latin America: A Brief Note

Susan De Vos

Center for Demography and Ecology

N Madison, Wisconsin

Historians and demographers have
traced a large increase in the proportion of the United States population
comprised of “primary” individuals,
+ principally those who live alone (Kobrin, 1976a; see also Sweet and Bumpass, 1988). In his overview of family

and household change in Europe, Keil-< man found a similar rise in one-person
= households there since World War II,
4 especially in northwestern Europe
> (1987). In demographic terms, the rise
is associated with the growing proportion of the elderly population and a
growing tendency among young adults
(until recently) to leave the parental
home before marriage. There is disagreement, however, whether the rise
has also been influenced primarily by
greater affluence (Michael et al., 1980)
Aor changing ideas (Pampel, 1983).
Rather than trying to assess change in
one-person households elsewhere, this
note simply offers a comparative perspective on what the situation may be
currently in the rest of the world, especially Latin America, because most
people live with others in families.

A WORLD-WIDE VIEW

The proportion of households comprised of only one person is shown in

 

Table 1 for selected countries of the
world. One must be cautious about interpreting such figures too literally because of potentially large differences in
the definition of “household” as well as
in more general matters of censustaking. However, if the figures have
any meaning, they suggest that oneperson households are most prevalent
in countries of the “Western culture
group,” followed by South and East
Europe, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the
Middle East. They suggest that there is
a definite difference between the West
and Latin America.

Japan exhibits a figure similar to
those of Western countries, although
its traditional family ideology has emphasized the coresidence of different
adult generations (see Palmore and
Maeda, 1985). Since Japan is a highlyindustrialized country, and has a large
elderly component to its population, it
can be used to study the general importance of industrialization on household composition. Baranwa] and Ram
(1985) explored the hypothesis that
“solo” living is positively related to societal development, having found the
situation in Japan particularly intriguing. While inconclusive, their findings
reinforced the notion that the “‘tradi

tional family” has an important impact
on the prevalence of one-person
households.

COMPARING THE UNITED STATES AND
SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES

While providing an important overview, the figures in Table 1 (if we can
trust them) tell us nothing about who
lives in one-person households. Research on the United States has found
primary individuals to be mainly young
and never-married or old and formerly-married (Kobrin, 1976b; Ruggles, 1988). Researchers suggest that
there is an important life-course di
_mension to being a primary individual

in a family system that is oriented toward the nuclear family (see also
Belcher, 1967).

Table 2 contains estimates of the

one-person households in the mid
1970’s for several Latin American
countries and who were “nonfamily
householders” in the United States in
1980. Age groups are aggregated in accord with the hypothesis to account for
the relatively small number of singleperson household members in the
Latin American countries. The ‘‘nonfamily householder” is as close as the

Since a majority of the nonfamily

either older formerly-married individuals or young never-married individuals, Table 3 shows the proportion of

Brief Reports

Latin America is probably conjugally
oriented (Todd, 1985), and the proportion of older people there in oneperson households could be of concern. Yet it should be noted that a
majority of elderly people reside in extended households and that there is little variation in this tendency by rural/
urban residence (De Vos, 1990).
Likewise, young adults are expected to
live independently once they are married and especially after a child or two
comes along, but most do not leave
their parental home until marriage (see
De Vos, 1989). Equally critical is the
situation of many middle-aged individuals, many of who live in one-person
households. In addition to the prevalence of marital disruption among this
age group, it is possible that migration
has a large disrupting effect on the family life of the middle-aged.

Whatever the reason may be for the

Social Biology

figures, we can conclude that the situation in Latin America is different
from that of nonfamily householders in
the United States at present. Whether
it will change to accord more closely
with the United States pattern in the
future is an open question.
