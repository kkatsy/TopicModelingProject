@BSTRACT: During the past decade, the marriage rate has declined and the divorce rate has
increased in Great Britain. Becker (1981) attributes such changes to improvements in the
onomic status of women, in that high-wage women gain less from marriage relative to other
omen. However, an empirical analysis of data from the General Household Survey 1985 in
reat Britain shows that male unemployment is another important determinant of changes in
garital status. High rates of male unemployment reduce the incidence of marriage and increase

the likelihood of divorce.
we

co During the past decade, the marWage rate has declined and the divorce
‘fate has increased in Great Britain. In
Sldition, divorce has become more
Brevalent (see Ermisch, 1983; Kiernan
and Eldridge, 1985; Kiernan, 1983;
Sander, 1986). The economic apBroach to marriage and divorce as deYeloped by Becker (1981) provides a
‘Basis for explaining changes in mar
tage and divorce rates. By and large,
Becker (1981) explains changes in the

mily as a product of the changing
&conomic status of women in that highWage women gain less from marriage
Flative to other women. Another important factor that might explain
changes in marriage and divorce rates
is relatively high unemployment. Previous research with county data for the
United Kingdom indicates that a decline in employment by men resulted in
higher divorce and lower marriage
rates (Sander, 1986). Research on
Denmark by Jensen and Smith (1990)
also supports the hypothesis that unemployment has a negative effect on
marital stability. This study provides

additional support with household data
on the negative effect of unemployment on the gains from marriage.

The effect of unemployment on
marital status is an important topic for
several reasons. First, marital status affects the quality of life. For example,
Taubman and Rosen (1982) show that
divorce has a negative effect on health.
Second, marital status could affect
productivity (e.g., through impacts on
health). Third, marital status affects
academic achievement. For example,
studies indicate that single parenthood
has a negative effect on children’s education (Krein and Beller, 1988).
Fourth, marital status affects labor
supply by both men and women
(Johnson and Skinner, 1986; Reed and
Harford, 1989). Fifth, marital status affects government expenditures. For
example, divorce and single parenthood affect welfare expenditures.
And, marital status affects income distribution.

The paper is organized as follows.
First, theoretical issues are briefly reviewed. Second, the empirical models

are presented. Third, the results are
examined. The paper closes with a discussion of the findings. The data that
are used in this study are taken from
the ‘General Household Survey
1985.’ The survey is an ongoing sample of private households in Great Britain. The number of respondents in the
1985 sample is 29,282. This represents
a response rate of 82 per cent. A detailed discussion of the sample is available elsewhere (Office of Population
Censuses and Surveys, 1987).

THEORETICAL ISSUES

The economic approach to marriage
as developed by Becker (1981) assumes rational utility-maximizing behavior in the marriage market. Thus,
“participants prefer to marry if, and
only if, their utility from marriage exceeds their utility from remaining single” (Becker, 1981, p. 40). It is assumed that the gains from marriage for
women decline as female earning ability increases. The reason for this is that
higher female earnings have a negative
effect on the demand for children and
reduce the advantages of the sexual division of labor in marriage (Becker,
1981, p. 231). Further, the prices of not
marrying and divorce are lower for
high-wage women (Sander, 1985). On
the other hand, high-wage men have
more ability in the marriage market
and gain more from marriage relative
to other men. Thus, an increase in
male earnings has a positive effect on
marriage and a negative effect on divorce (Becker, 1981, p. 231).

Schooling has an ambiguous effect
on the gains from marriage and divorce

Sander

 

Social Biology

because “education reduces the division of labor between mates (thus lowering the gain from marriage) while increasing the gain from any given
division of labor” (Becker et al., 1977,
p. 1156). For example, schooling increases the labor force participation
rate of wives, thus lowering the gains
from marriage. On the other hand,
highly educated wives “have greater
gains because of the spouses’ high levels of market and nonmarket skills”
(Becker et al., 1977, p. 1156).

A possibly more important effect of
schooling is on age at first marriage.
Numerous studies indicate that schooling delays entry into marriage (Carlson, 1979; Keeley, 1974). Also, studies
indicate that age at first marriage has a
U-shaped effect on divorce (Becker et
al., 1977). Thus, schooling might reduce divorce through its effect on reducing relatively early marriages
(Bumpass and Sweet, 1972). Schooling
also could affect preferences for marriage and divorce.

The economic model of marriage
and divorce is also based upon unexpected events reducing the gains from
marriage and increasing the likelihood
of divorce. For example, Becker et al.
(1977) argue that an increase in the deviation between actual and expected
earnings increases the likelihood of divorce. Thus, an unexpected event such
as unemployment should result in a decline in the incidence of marriage and
an increase in the probability of divorce.

Many other factors might also affect
marriage and divorce rates. Sex ratios
affect the availability of a spouse. An
increase (decrease) in the ratio of
males to females should increase (decrease) the likelihood of marriage for

 
a aaa

females and reduce (increase) it for
males. Religious and ethnic background might also affect marital
‘‘search”’ costs as well as norms regarding marriage and divorce.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE MonpELs

Logit is used to estimate the marital
“status of men age thirty-five to fiftyofour in Great Britain. Estimates of
omen who are currently married and
Sever-married men who are currently
coodivorced are undertaken. Estimates
ator other age groups were also undercitaken. These estimates are not re‘=ported because they did not contribute
zanything of additional interest to the
sipaper. Further, estimates for relatively
‘Syoung men and relatively old men are
= of less interest because many young
‘Smen have not yet married and many
Sold men are economically inactive.
5 Logit i is used since the dependent variables are discrete (either zero or one).
- The logit model that is estimated is log
5(p/(1-p))/2 where p is the odds that the
‘Brespondent is, for example, currently
‘Smarried. The statistical package that is
"cused (SPSSX) divides the logit by two
cand adds five to the intercept.
Estimates of women’s marital status
are not pursued because variables relating to women’s labor supply are
highly endogenous with marital status.
Single and divorced women are more
likely to work because the marginal
value of their time in work is high relative to married women. Further,
women who work are a select group;
their unobserved characteristics might
be correlated with labor supply variables. These unobservables also might

be endogenous with marital status. For
these reasons, the focus is on men. Labor supply variables for men, particularly the ones used in this study, are
relatively exogenous to marital status.

Although the “General Household
Survey” contains some information on
earnings, it is too limited to be useful in
this study. Most of the data on earnings
for men are missing. Thus, one shortcoming of this study is that wage rates
or earnings cannot be used to estimate
marital status. However, detailed data
are available on occupation. Since occupation is correlated with earning
ability, controls are entered for occupation. Thus, an indirect adjustment is
made for earning ability. One must
recognize that men’s occupations
might have noneconomic effects on
marital status. Thus, interpretations of
occupational effects should be made
with caution.

Data on educational attainment are
available. Since education affects earning ability, education also provides another indirect control for economic
background. The education variables
that are used include respondents with
“QO” level qualifications (or equivalent), respondents with “A” level qualifications (or equivalent), and respondents with university degrees. “O”
level qualifications indicate education
beyond the compulsory level. Similarly, “‘A” leve] qualifications are superior to “O” levels. A university degree would be taken after ““A”’ levels.
Once again, education effects could be
noneconomic in nature. The coefficients for these variables should likewise be interpreted with caution.

The employment variables include
men employed and men unemployed.
The omitted category includes men

who are economically inactive, sick, or
waiting for work. The vast majority of
men in the omitted category are economically inactive.

Adjustments are made for whether
the respondent is from the New Commonwealth (including Pakistan) or
Scotland. These variables are defined
by country of birth. In preliminary
work with the data, an attempt was
made to adjust for other ethnic groups
in Great Britain. This effort was not
successful because other groups were
too small. The New Commonwealth
and Pakistan variable could indicate a
number of very different influences on
marriage and divorce rates. First, racial discrimination against this group
could affect earning ability and the
gains from marriage (Stewart, 1983).
Second, different norms could affect
marriage and divorce. For example,
data indicate that West Indian families
in Britain are less stable while Asian
families are more stable (Brown,
1984). And third, differences in the ratio of men and women in this group
could affect the incentive to marry.

The effect of a Scottish heritage is
not clear as well. This variable probably picks up social as well as economic
phenomena. In a related study residence in Scotland was found to have a
negative effect on divorce (Sander,
1986). Finally, adjustments are made
for a number of regions within Great

 

Social Biology

Britain. The omitted region is Greater
London. The regional dummies pick
up differences in various Ssocioeconomic factors including female earning
ability as well as differences in tastes.
In Table 1, data are arrayed on the dependent variables and the independent
variables that are of particular interest.

RESULTS

The estimates of marital status support the suggested hypothesis regarding unemployment. Employment has a
highly significant positive effect on the
odds that men are married and a highly
significant negative effect on the jikelthood they are divorced (Table 2), On
the other hand, unemployment reduces the odds that men are married,
and it increases the probability they are
divorced.

Somewhat surprisingly, schooling
and ethnic background were not found
to affect marital status. Of the occupational variables, professional and managerial jobs are positively associated
with marriage and negatively related to
divorce. Also, farmers are less likely to
be married.

Several of the regional variables indicated a higher marriage rate relative
to Greater London. These included the
Northwest, the Midlands, the Southeast, East Anglia, and Scotland. For
the divorce estimate, Scotland was

found to have a significantly lower divorce rate. Finally, age has a significant
nonlinear effect on marriage and no effect on divorce.

DISCUSSION

Unemployment is directly associated with a lower incidence of marriage
and a higher incidence of divorce for
men. Also, men in relatively high-wage
occupations (professionals and managers) are less likely to be divorced and
are more likely to be married. Thus,
the evidence is consistent with the economic theory of marriage and divorce.
Employed men with relatively high
wages gain more from marriage relative to unemployed men and men with
relatively low wages.

The results also provide an additional explanation for the increase in
the divorce rate in Great Britain during
the past decade: Relatively high rates
of unemployment destabilized marriages. Although Becker (1981, pp.
242-256) explains trends in divorce in
Great Britain as a product of increases
in the earning ability of women, this
factor seems to be only one part of the
story.

One new result in this study is that
education appears to be unrelated to

 

Social Biology

marital status for men age thirty-five to
fifty-four. In a previous study on the
United Kingdom, it was suggested that
education reduced the marriage rate
and increased the divorce rate (Sander,
1986). The previous study used county
data that imprecisely measured education. The finding that education has no
effect on divorce is consistent with previous research by Jensen and Smith
(1990).

The results also suggest the essential
role of employment policy. Cyclical
and structural unemployment have
negative effects on family stability.
Subsequently, family instability results
in substantial social costs including
negative effects on health, children’s
education, and so on. In the United
States, high unemployment in the
black community has contributed substantially to a breakdown of the black
family (Wilson, 1987). This, in turn, is
resulting in high dropout rates in
schools and very high crime rates.
