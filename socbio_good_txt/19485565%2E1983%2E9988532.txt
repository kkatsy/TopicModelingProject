ABSTRACT: A social selection model for deleterious genes has been studied by considering two
alleles at one locus. The model allows for the fitness of an individual to be determined by parental phenotypes as well as by his/her own phenotype. We show that the equilibrium gene frequency depends on the loss of fitness of an individual due to the trait (y) and due to affected
parents (8), and the probability that the heterozygote develops the trait (h). We show that
whenever an interior equilibrium point exists for given values of y and 8, it is unique and that
the sufficient condition for the existence of the equilibrium point is given by

Two individuals with identical term “social selection” may be more

appropriate for human populations
(see Discussion section). Yokoyama (1981) also considered the fitness modification of offspring due to
affected parents, although he again
only dealt with rare deleterious genes.
In this paper, we shall conduct deterministic analyses of the population
dynamics of deleterious genes under
the fitness modification of offspring by
affected parents. We are especially interested in obtaining the equilibrium
gene frequencies without the process of
mutation. This study will complement
the equilibrium analyses of Yokoyama
(1981). The results obtained will be
compared to those for the equivalent
kin selection model anlayzed by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman (1978), and
the implication of these differences for
human populations will be discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A detailed description of the model
is given by Yokoyama (1981). Briefly,

assume that a mutant gene A, and its
wild type allele A, are segregating with
respective frequencies p and q in the
adult population, with the frequencies
of A,A,, A,A,, and A,A, denoted by
u, v, and w, respectively. Assume further that A,A, always develops a disease, A,A, is always normal, and that
AA, develops the disease with probability 4. Let y be the magnitude of
fitness loss of an individual due to the
trait, and let 8/2 and B be the magnitude of fitness loss when an individual
has one or two affected parents, respectively. Note that the value of £ is
generally positive, but that it can be
either positive or negative. We assume
that the fitness of an individual is determined multiplicatively, with the relative fitnesses of a normal individual
with two normal parents, one affected
parent, and two affected parents given
by 1, 1 — 8/2, and I — 8, respectively,
and the relative fitnesses of an affected
individual with two normal parents,
one affected parent, and two affected
parents are given by 1 — y, (1 — y)(1 —
8/2), and (1 — y)(1 — B), respectively.
It is assumed that the gene frequency
is changed by the processes of random
mating, reproduction, and selection, in
that order.

After the development of the disease and selection, Yokoyama (1981)
has shown that the frequencies of the
three genotypes in the next generation
are given by

w= p= N(- HY /W, (1)
v= 2pq(1 — hy)(1 — H2)/W, (1.2)

w= g(I—H3)/W, (13)

D =h(1— hy)[2y + B(1 — y)].

Equation (9) provides a necessary
and sufficient condition for an equilibrium to exist. Yokoyama (1981) has
noted that a sufficient condition for a
polymorphism to be maintained is that

2Y 2y
Poay <<Go. (10)

The left boundary approaches to
—oo as y> 1/2 and the right boundary approaches to — co as y—> 1. Thus,
when y > 1/2 the condition (10) is reduced simply to B < —2y/(1 — y). We
will show that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the nontrivial
equilibria given by (9) and the set defined in (10).

First, note the cubic equation given
in (9) may be factored as

 

Social Biology

[(1 — 2h)p + A][ ap? + bp +c] =0,
(11)

with

a= 2y7(1 —2h+ hy + Bh(1 — y))

b= —2y(2y(1 — h) + BCI — y))

c=(1 —hy)(2y + B(1 — y)).
Accordingly, when h=1/2 (if A=
1/2, the leading term of the cubic is 0),
a root is given by p= —h/(1 — 2h).
This root is outside the interval [0, 1]
when A is strictly between 0 and I,
equal to 0 when h = 0, and equal to 1
when h = I.

In the case a #0Q, the roots of the
quadratic are given by

_ —-h+b* — 4ac

t 2a ,
—bh— b* — 4ac

P2>= 4a .

When 5b + 0, a sufficient condition for
one of the roots to be 0 1s that c = 0,
with p,=0 if b>0, and p,=0 if
b <0. But c = 0 implies 2y + B(1 — y)
= 0, or 8B = —2y/(1 — y). In this case,
b=4y*h, so that p)=0 and p, #0
when h > 0. When 6=0, B=[-2y/
(1 — y)J(1 — A), so that b is nonzero in
the region given by (10), and vantshes
on the right hand boundary only when
h=0. Thus, 0 is not a root in the
interior of the region displayed in Figure I, p; =0 and p,#0 on the right
hand boundary when h>0, and p,
= p»=0 when h=0. Theoretically,
the quantity B can take any value in
B< 1, but the region —1 < B <0 is
shown in the figure.

A necessary and sufficient condition
for 1 to be a root of equation (11) is
that a+b+c=0, with p,=1 and
pPr#1 if 2a+b6>0 and p,# and
pr. =1if 2a+b<0. Thus, 1 will be a

Vol. 30, No. 2

root when (8 —2y8 + 2y)(1 — y)U hy) =0, or B= —2y/(1 —2y), ie.,
along the left boundary in Figure 1.
Moreover, 2a + b =4y7(1 — h)(1 — y)
/(1 — 2y) > 0, so that p, = I along the
boundary B= —2y/(1—2y), and
Pp, #1 unless h = 1.

Therefore, 0 and 1 are never roots
in the region given by (10) and depicted in Figure 1, p, is identically
equal to | on the left boundary and
identically equal to 0 on the right
boundary. Since there is a solution
with 0< p, <1 inside the region, a
simple continuity argument shows that
0 < p, < 1 over the whole set given by
(10). Similarly, it is easy to see that p,
is either negative or greater than | in
this region, so that in the case a +0,
there exists precisely one solution of
(9) between 0 and | for each parameter
set (A, y, 8), when y and £ satisfy (10).
When a=0, ie., h=1/Q-—yBU — y)), then the root is given by
Pp, = —¢/6, which is between 0 and |
when (10) is satisfied.

For h=0, 1/2, and 1, and h#

solutions are

The range of £8 values which satisfy
(10) as well as equilibrium gene frequencies for the values of y= 0.01,
0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 are given in Table 1.
The equilibrium gene frequency is
computed using the intermediate value
(B*) of —2y/(1 —2y) and —2y/(1 —
y). The examples in the table show that
high equilibrium frequencies can be
maintained especially for recessive
genes. As seen from Figure I, when the
value of y is small the range of B
which satisfies condition (10) is very

' narrow.

It is of interest to compare stability
condition (10) to the results obtained
by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman (1978)
for kin selection for altruism. Let us
write 8B’ = — B, so that condition (10)
becomes

(see Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman,

restrictive than (17). Thus, it is harder
to maintain a polymorphism under social selection than under kin selection.
This is expected because viability selection operates before mating in the social selection model, whereas the viability and fertility selections are considered simultaneously in the kin selection model.

In the analyses, the process of mutation has been ignored, and we have
dealt only with common alleles. Under
this condition we have shown that the
necessary and sufficient condition for
the stability of the interior equilibrium point is —2y/(1—2y)< B<
—2y/(1—y). When B > -—2y/Uy), with an additional process of mutational change from A, to A, of a per
generation, the equilibrium frequency
of A, genes is given approximately

by a/hs for 0<h 1, and Va/s
for h=0, where s=y+ B(1 — y)
/2 (Yokoyama, 1981). When B<
—2y/(1 —2y), there does not exist
any interior equilibrium point, unless
one assumes the consistent mutational
change from A, to A, in every generation. However, the occurrence of advantageous mutation in every generation seems to be very unlikely, and the
equilibrium study in that range may
not be meaningful. Thus, the present
as well as the previous studies in
Yokoyama (1981) cover the equilibrium analyses of the entire range of the
combination of y and f.

Fitness interaction among relatives
has been considered in the study of
altruism, where the concept of kin selection has an important role (Hamilton, 1964; Levitt, 1975; Matessi and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

Vol. 30, No. 2

Jayakar, 1976; Charlesworth, 1978;
Wade, 1978; Yokoyama and Felsenstein, 1978; Cavalli-Sforza and
Feldman, 1978; Uyenoyama and
Feldman, 1980; and others).

Social selection may be regarded as
the general family of kin selection
models. However, the term “social selection” seems to be more appropriate
for the following two reasons. First, the
gene which causes a specific genetic
disease is not directly involved in the
change of his relatives’ fitnesses, rather
the fitness modification depends on the
ambient social structure of a society.
The magnitude of social impact may
well differ from one society to another.
Thus, the social structure is the main
cause of the fitness modification. Second, considering the fitness modification of offspring by affected parents,
we have shown that it is harder to
maintain a polymorphism under social
selection than under kin selection. This
difference occurs because the loss of
fitness of an altruistic parent cannot be
determined until he/she has offspring
so that viability selection in the usual
sense can not be included in the kin
selection model. Necessity of the coexistence of an altruist and a recipient
for the fitness determination limits the
applicability of existing theories in kin
selection models to human populations. Obviously, genetic diseases in
man can cause mortality of an individual before he/she has an offspring.

When a parent is affected and

Social Selection

187

he/she increases the fitness of the
progeny, the stable equilibrium gene
frequency can be attained as long as
condition (10) holds. An interesting implication of the present model may be
seen in the mechanism of the maintenance of the high incidences of albinisms among Amerindians in the
Southwestern United States and Central America. Most of these populations are not large and therefore the
joint effect of social selection and random genetic drift may be important
(Yokoyama and Morgan, 1981). For
this recessive disease Woolf and Dukepoo (1969) proposed a “cultural selection.” Albino men stay at home because of their sensitivity to sunlight,
while other men leave for work, and
the former have a greater chance of
passing their genes onto the next generation. However, in the studies of the
Brandywine isolate and Zuni Indians,
Witkop et al. (1972) did not find any
evidence of such illegitimate offspring
involving albinos. Albinos are completely accepted in the Hopi society,
and traditional Hopis have only a positive attitude toward them (Woolf and
Dukepoo, 1969). It is thus conceivable
that even though albinos are less fit,
their relatives have increased fitnesses.
