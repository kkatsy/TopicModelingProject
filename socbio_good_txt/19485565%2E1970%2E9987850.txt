Amish Demography

The Amish sect originated in 1693 in the
canton of Berne, Switzerland, when followers of Jakob Ammann left the parent
Swiss Brethren sect. Later dissensions led to
the formation of several theologically related but more progressive groups also sometimes called Amish, so that for identification
the original sect is properly known as “Old
Order Amish.” For brevity, however, the
shorter generic term ‘‘Amish’’ will be used
in this report. Religious and social aspects of
Amish society are discussed elsewhere
(McKusick, Hostetler, and Egeland, 1964;
Hostetler, 1963; Huntingdon, 1956).

Some Amish who left Berne eventually
settled in Alsace-Lorraine, eastern France,
and the Palatinate where they gained additional converts. Severe persecution forced
them to move frequently and finally
prompted their immigration to the United
States beginning about 1727, The earliest
immigrants came primarily from Switzerland and settled in eastern Pennsylvania;
later groups who moved on to Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois were converts from other areas
in Europe. This diversity in origin and the
continued isolation of these communities
since their founding have led to the formation of ‘‘genetic isolates” with close inbreeding among the descendants (Cross, 1967).

Two characteristics of the Amish make
them especially useful for population studies, Firstly, birth control in any form is
strictly forbidden, a restriction which stems
from the biblical admonition to “be fruitful
and multiply.” Errant couples are required
to confess their wrongdoing before the entire
church membership. The enhanced social
standing achieved by couples with many
children supplies additional pressure to comply with the group norm. Childless couples
frequently adopt multiple orphans or offspring of unmarried mothers (usually Amish). Secondly, standards of living and medical care are relatively high among the
Amish. Most recognize the importance of
professional prenatal care and preventive
health measures. Good medical care is considered a necessity, and families unable to
meet expenses are assisted by other members.

No existing Amish community has been
the subject of comprehensive population
studies, although estimates of certain vital
statistics have been made. Smith (1960)
used birth and death records, as well as data
from published genealogical records, to determine ages at marriage, premarital conception rates, and family sizes during the
last century. More current data were used
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

84 Cross and McKusick

to determine the age and sex distribution of
an existing Amish community in southeastern Pennsylvania (Smith, 1960). Hostetler
(1963) obtained data from informants in
representative church districts in several
states to estimate age and sex distribution,
ages at marriage, total population size, and
ratios of members to nonmembers. Complete census data have been collected by
Mook (1955) for Crawford County, Pennsylvania, by the Old Order Map Committee
(1965) for Lancaster and Lebanon counties
in Pennsylvania, and by Juberg (1966) for
the Amish in northern Indiana.

This report on Amish demography is
based on complete census data of Ohio
Amish living in Holmes and immediately
adjacent counties, hereafter referred to as
the Holmes County community.

The first Amish to settle in Holmes
County arrived in 1810. Rapid internal
growth led to formation of other settlements
throughout Ohio in the latter part of the
nineteenth century, and by 1900 the
Holmes County community was expanding
into contiguous areas, namely Wayne
County to the north, Tuscarawas County to
the east, and Coshocton County to the
south (Cross, 1967).

METHODS

The Holmes County data were gathered
in the final quarter of 1964 by distributing
printed forms to each family. By working
through a community leader who wished to
prepare a directory for the use of his coreligionists, the possible stigma resulting
from involvement of ‘outsiders’? was
avoided. In this manner, data were obtained
on 98% of Old Order Amish families in
which one or both spouses were alive (excluding the nearly two hundred families of
two ultraconservative Holmes County Amish sects who are theologically distinct).

Information collected on each family included church district of present residence,

Social Biology

mailing address, occupation and birthplace
of both parents, names of grandparents, date
and place of marriage of the parents, name
and marital status of every live-born child,
and birth and death dates of all family members. Information on the previous marital
partner of remarried individuals was also
obtained, All data were stored on computer
tape for later analysis and publication
(Cross and Gingerich, 1966).

RESULTS
AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION

Information collected from 1,933 families
revealed a total of 9,724 living individuals.
The number of males (4,854) and females
(4,870) was nearly equal. The Amish are a
young population (Table 1 and Fig. 1); the
majority (51.8%) are less than 20 years of
age, and 28.7% are less than 10 years old.

The mean percentage of completed families (those in which the mother is at least 45
years of age) for all church districts is 44.9;
for the 13 most peripheral districts, the
mean percentage is 38.7. Amish parents frequently must buy additional land for their
offspring and, since non-Amish farms are
more readily available on the fringes of the
settlement, newly formed families tend to
move centrifugally.

SEX RATIOS

The sex ratio of the Holmes County
Amish population at the end of 1964 was
1.003 which corresponds closely to the ratio
of 1.005 for both the Hutterites (Eaton and
Mayer, 1953) and the Amish of southeastern
Pennsylvania in 1950 (Smith, 1960). This
compares with a sex ratio of only 0.971 for
the entire United States population, and
1.043 for rural regions alone in 1960 (C. L.
Beale, personal communication).

Among Holmes County Amish under 10
years of age, the sex ratio was 1.037, but females outnumbered males in the 30 to 54 age
groups. The sex ratio among 9,023 Holmes
County live births (most stillbirths and

neonatal deaths were not reported) was only
1.022.
OCCUPATIONS

Of 1,930 heads of households and single
men not living with their parents, 69.8%
considered themselves full or part-time
farmers. Another 13.1% were employed in
construction and repair trades such as carpentry, cabinet construction, blacksmithing,
and harness repairing. A majority of the
12.1% Holmes County Amish men who reported themselves employed as “‘laborers”
probably worked as hired hands on farms or
as employees of construction businesses.

Single Amish girls often work as maids
for non-Amish families or as store clerks in
small towns, but after marriage Amish
women are not employed outside the home.

MARITAL PATTERNS

A total of 2,013 first and subsequent marriages were recorded, of which 1,734, or
86.1%, involved partners who were born in
the community. In 12.1% of marriages, one
of the partners was born in another community. However, many of these “‘outside”’
partners were probably offspring of families
who had moved into the area, since 63.5% of
marriages in which the female was born outside Holmes County were officiated in
Holmes County and Amish weddings are
generally celebrated in the bride’s home.
Similarly, nearly half of the 1.3% of marriages where both partners were born outside the community were solemnized in
Holmes County.

Among the 305 marital partners born
outside Holmes County, 80.3% came from
those communities primarily settled by migrants from the Holmes County community,
ie., those in Ohio, Indiana, and western
Pennsylvania (Table 2). An additional
13.8% came from other communities which
had in turn been settled by the Indiana community. Only four out of 4,026 partners
came from settlements in eastern Pennsy]lvania.

Social Biology

Of 1,888 first marriages officiated in
Holmes County, 81.2% occurred in October
through February and less than 2% occurred in June, July, and August (Fig. 2).

Among 1,887 marriages for which adequate data were available, the mean age at
first marriage was 22.57 years for females
and 23.61 years for males (Table 3 and Fig.
3). Only seven males and 45 females married before 18 years of age. The median age
for females was 23.0 years and for males 24.1
years compared with 20.6 and 22.8 years for
females and males, respectively, in the
United States in 1965 (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1965). Hutterite females marry at a
median age of 22.0 years and the males at
23.5 years (Eaton and Mayer, 1953).

The mean age difference for Holmes
County Amish couples is 1.05 years (husband older) compared with a 1.5 year differential found by Smith (1960) among
southeastern Pennsylvania Amish couples.
Surprisingly, however, 34.7% of Holmes
County males marry females older than
themselves (Table 3 and Fig. 4). The mean
age differential of 2.64 years for marriages in
which the husband is older is only 0.71 years
greater than the age differential among marriages in which the wife is older.

PREMARITAL CONCEPTIONS

Among 1,888 first marriages in Holmes
County, 133, or 7.04%, produced liveborn
children within eight months after the marriage date. The mean interval between marriage and first birth was 4.5 months (S.D. =
2.0 months). These 133 couples include six
in whom the first birth occurred before marriage; the six intervals ranged from 0.9 to
10.4 months which makes it unlikely that
such pregnancies resulted from previously
terminated marriages. These six cases are
certainly not the only live births which occurred among unmarried females because
such offspring are usually adopted by other
families and are not listed as a member of
the mother’s family when she later marries,

a factor which contributes to an underestimation of premarital conceptions.

The mean age at marriage for the 133
Amish couples was 22.37 years for the husbands and 21,15 years for the wives, suggesting that courtship was shortened by approximately one year.

STERILITY

Of 792 Holmes County Amish women
who lived with their husbands until at least

 

Amish Demography 87

45 years of age, only 30, or 3.8%, had never
been pregnant. Eaton and Mayer (1953)
found that only 10 of 340, or 2.9%, of married Hutterite women never had a live birth.
Probably this latter percentage would be
even lower if pregnancies instead of live
births were considered. These percentages
are below the 4 to 5% of married American
women who are thought to be unable to
become pregnant due to involuntary causes
(Thompson and Lewis, 1965).

TWINNING

Among 8,885 pregnancies terminating in
live births, 136 produced twins, and one
pregnancy terminated in the birth of triplets
(Table 4). This frequency (15.3 per 1,000
live births) of twin births compares with
14.5 and 14.3 per 1,000 total births for the
nonwhite population of the United States
and the population of Norway, respectively
(Guttmacher, 1953; Lilienfeld and Pasamanick, 1955; Stern, 1960), two populations
with the highest known twinning frequency.
Among the Northern Indiana Amish, the
twinning frequency is 21.1 per 1,000 livebirths (Juberg, 1966).

Amish Demography 89

of twins born in the entire United States
(Stern, 1960; Scheinfeld, 1965), and the
excess dizygous pairs would presumably account for the high frequency of Amish twin
births. However, the Weinberg method may
overestimate the proportion of dizygosity in
the Amish since among the genetically similar northern Indiana Amish (most of whom
are descendants of Ohio Amish) actual zygosity determinations of all pairs using sex
and blood groups revealed 56% to be dizygous (Juberg, 1966). The actual frequency
of dizygosity among the Indiana Amish
(11.8 per 1,000 livebirths) is similar to the
estimated frequency of 12.4 per 1,000 live

If one assumes a 1:1 sex ratio at birth and
ascertainment of twins without regard to
zygosity, the proportion of mono- and dizygotic twins can be estimated by Weinberg’s
differential method. Since the total number
of dizygotic pairs should be equal to twice
the number of unlike sex pairs, 110 pairs of
twins should be dizygotic and 26 pairs monozygotic. Therefore, approximately 82% of
all twin births in the Holmes County Amish
would be dizygous compared with 64 to 76%

FERTILITY

Crude birth rate-——The Amish crude birth
rate is 33.3, compared with 21.2 for the entire United States for the same year (United
Nations, 1964) and 45.9 for the Hutterites in
1948 (Eaton and Mayer, 1953), and is comparable to the rate in the United States in
1900 (Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958).

them in middle age and sustain a higher
birth rate until menopause. As a result,
among all married women aged 15 to 49, the
Hutterites have a 26% greater fertility rate.

Completed fertility-——Data on number of
pregnancies and number of children were
collected by personal interviews of all
Holmes County Amish families in which the

Fertility ratio—The number of children
aged 0-4 years per thousand Amish women
20-44 years of age is 1,010, a ratio 48.7%
higher than the ratio existing among all
rural white inhabitants in the east North
Central United States in 1950 (Grabill et al.,
1958).

Age-standardized nuptial fertility rates —
These rates are high for Amish women between the ages of 19 and 40, but Hutterite
women outperform them in all age groups
with the greatest difference being among
women over the age of 30 years (Table 5).
Thus, Hutterite women, although nearly

 

ber of reported Amish pregnancies was 7.19
with a standard deviation of 3.69. More
than half of these women (56.5%) reported
seven or more pregnancies while 26.6% reported 10 or more (Table 6).

Because pregnancy data are somewhat
unreliable (for example, most pregnancies
terminated in the first trimester are probably not reported), the number of live births
per woman is a more reliable indicator of
fertility for comparisons between populations with similar standards of living and
medical care. Amish completed families had
a mean number of 6.33 children compared

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

with 8.96 for Hutterites (Fig. 5). Nearly half
of Hutterite women (48.3%) have 10 or
more liveborn children compared with only
17.9% of Amish women.

Natural increase —Using a standard life
table, the Amish net reproduction rate is
2,454, compared with 3,830 for the Hutterites and Jess than 2,000 for California and
New York populations (Table 7). The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) for the
Amish is 3.019% compared with 4.1265%
for the Hutterites (Eaton and Mayer, 1953).

Thus the Amish could increase in number by
about 145% each generation (where a generation is considered the number of years
corresponding to the mean maternal age for
all Amish births, 29.68 years) or double in
number every 23 years.

BIRTH INTERVALS

Due to interfamily variations in fertility,
birth intervals must be arranged according
to family size, and therefore only data from
completed families can be used. The birth

with known fetal wastage.

In Table 8, intervals from marriage to
birth of the first child include only marriages
of 8 months or more duration in order to
eliminate the majority of premarital conceptions. The mean of these intervals is 19.9
months, excluding one-child families since
their interval to first birth is nearly twice as
long as families with more than one live
birth. Since this first interval is the only one
which does not include a prior anovulatory
period, it is estimated that the average married woman required 10.9 months of exposure to the risk of pregnancy before conception occurred. The mean intervals between
births are longer, suggesting that the period
of postpartum infecundity is of the order of
6 to 8 months, compared with the 5 to 7
month period calculated by Sheps (1965) for
the Hutterites. For unexplained reasons, the
interval preceding the last birth is usually
longer than intervals between previous

tions, but the Hutterites appear to be an
exception (Sheps, 1965).

It has been reported (Renkonen and
Lehtovaara, 1962; Renkonen, 1964) that the
sex of the preceding child may influence the
length of the interval to the next birth, but
this is not true in the Holmes County Amish.
Data from 7,108 births (excluding first
births) revealed no significant difference in
the length of the interval to the next birth
whether the previous child was male or female.

DISCUSSION

Comparison of the age pyramids (Fig. 1)
of the Holmes County Amish and their rural
living neighbors provides graphic proof of the
cultural and social isolation of the Amish,
Their self-sufficient agrarian existence renders them independent of cyclic depressing and stimulating effects of political, economic, and social changes which produce
variations in the size of non-Amish age
groups. Similar evidence of isolation has
been found in the Hutterites (Eaton and
Mayer, 1953; Steinberg et al., 1967).

The sex ratio of Amish over the age of 55
(1.216) is much higher than that of the
general United States population. For reasons as yet unknown, Amish men tend to
outlive their wives. A predominance of
males among older age groups was also noted
in the Hutterites by Eaton and Mayer
(1953) and confirmed in a later census by
Steinberg and colleagues (1967). Eaton and
Mayer (1953) suggested that multiparity
may have an adverse effect on longevity.
Additional evidence for their hypothesis
comes from the study of Indiana Amish by
Juberg (1966) who found the lowest mean
number of offspring among older women.
Holmes County Amish women do have a
high fertility, but no direct evidence is available to confirm the Eaton and Mayer
hypothesis.

Amish marital patterns in all communities are characterized by monogamy and

 

Amish Demography 95

strict endogamy. Divorce is forbidden and,
although on rare occasion marital discord
leads to separation of the partners, they may
not remarry until the spouse has died. The
choice of marital partners is not limited to a
single community, but rather to members of
the entire clan. In practice, of course, the
pool of available mates is greatly reduced by
the limitations of horse-and-buggy transportation. This limits courtship to the local
settlement although rare exceptions occur as
the result of the limited practice of “hiring
out” to other Amish communities for short
periods. Even this travel between communities is not random, however, but is strongly
influenced by family ties and certain less
visible ideological similarities. For example,
the Holmes County community, which contributed most of the settlers of the Northern
Indiana community, has considerably more
contact with the Indiana Amish than with
the eastern Pennsylvania Amish, The latter
are in many ways more traditional and conservative, although these ideological differences in most cases do not result in formal
“shunning” of each other’s members. As
might be expected, other communities in
Ohio have the greatest interchange with the
Holmes County community (Table 2).

The wedding season of Amish in northern
Indiana is comparable to that of the Holmes
County Amish, Among a sample of Amish
families in Indiana, 42.6% married in November and December while 78.1% married
in the months of October through February
(Juberg, 1966), compared to 46.0 and 81.2%
for the same periods in Holmes County.
Among the Amish of eastern Pennsylvania,
however, Smith (1960) found that 92.0% of
1,231 weddings during 1890 to 1959 took
place in November and December.

An Amish wedding is an elaborate affair
in which the majority of friends and relatives are expected to participate. Their antiquated farming methods require dawn-todusk labor during the spring and summer,
leaving little time for social events. This is

96 Cross and McKusick

largely responsible for the seasonality of
weddings shown in Fig. 2 which illustrates
not only the conformity in this rigid society,
but also demands an explanation for the 1.9
per cent of weddings which occur in the
summer months of June, July, and August.
Though obviously not the reason in all cases,
premarital conception is probably the most
urgent cause of “‘out of season” weddings. A
strong sense of responsibility plus religious
sanctions influences the vast majority of biological fathers to marry their pregnant
mates. Among marriages which occurred
during the summer months and in which
couples had lived together for at least nine
months when the census was taken, 55.9%
recorded the birth of a child less than seven
months after the date of marriage. This premarital pregnancy rate is nearly seven times
greater than the rate among all marriages.

Remarriages may be less seasonal because
the social event is less elaborate and timeconsuming. Smith (1960) found that 36.1%
of all remarriages among Pennsylvania
Amish occurred “‘out of season” compared to
8% of first marriages. The wedding season
of 87 remarriages recorded in Holmes
County, however, differed little from that of
first marriages. The majority (89.6%) were
remarriages of males and 77% of these chose
previously unmarried females.

Contrary to a prevailing impression, the
Amish do not marry at a younger age than
the rest of the population. The misconception has probably persisted because the
Amish have several characteristics of groups
in which marriages occur at a young age:
rural living, poor education, and large families. However, Amish mothers frequently
urge their daughters to delay marriage in
order to limit their eventual family size, and
this no doubt is one reason for the more advanced age at marriage. The same reason
probably also explains in part the unusually
high proportion of wives who are older than
their husbands.

Premarital intercourse is strongly dis
Social Biology

couraged, even condemned by the Amish
theocracy. Those who transgress are expelled from the membership and are required to make oral confession before the
entire church membership before reinstatement, It is important to note, however, that
when premarital conceptions do occur, illegitimacy due to uncertain paternity usually does not result since in most cases the
biological parents marry. Juberg (1966), for
example, using ABO, Rh, and MN blood
typing, found no paternal exclusions among
1,098 offspring of 155 couples. In even more
extensive continuing family studies, mainly
in the Pennsylvania Lancaster County
Amish, W. Bias (personal communication)
has found no inconsistencies pointing to false
paternity.

Data on premarital conceptions among
the Amish are all retrospective and tabulated from information voluntarily supplied
by couples during the course of genealogic or
census studies. No doubt a certain unknown
amount of error results from juggling of marriage and first birth dates, but this error is
probably small since the moral stigma of
premarital violations, once confessed, does
not remain among the Amish.

Smith (1960) calculated a somewhat
lower percentage of premarital conceptions
for Amish families in southeastern Pennsylvania, an average of 4.1% among couples
married between 1890 and 1949. It is not
known what accounts for the lower rate of
premarital conceptions in the Pennsylvania
than in the Ohio community.

In spite of religious pressures, Amish females have approximately the same premarital conception frequency as females in
other rural United States communities. For
example, Christensen (1963) found that
9.7% of births within wedlock in Tippecanoe
County, Indiana, were premaritally conceived compared with 7.8% in Defiance
County, Ohio (in which some Amish live),
and 3.7% among the Mormons in Utah.
These percentages are much lower than

Vol. 17, No. 2

those found in urban United States communities and some European countries
(Pratt, 1965; Hair, 1966; Goldstein, 1967).

The lack of an increased amount of sterility in inbred groups such as the Hutterites
and the Amish suggests that recessive genes
are not a Significant cause of sterility. It is
also possible, of course, that such genes, if
they exist, were by chance not segregating in
either of these populations.

The frequency of twin births varies
among countries and ethnic groups due principally to differences in the frequency of
dizygotic twin births (Komai and Fukuoka,
1936). Such ethnic differences together with
occasional familial aggregation have been
cited as evidence for the role of genetic factors in twinning. The fact that the frequency
of dizygosity in the two inbred Amish groups
is more than 60% greater than the frequency
of 7.4 per 1,000 livebirths among whites in
the United States suggests that recessive
genes are involved.

In addition to genetic factors, however,
the frequency of dizygotic twins is also influenced by increased maternal age and increased parity (Stern, 1960; Scheinfeld,
1965). These influences act individually and
in the same direction. Among the Indiana
Amish, Juberg (1966) found that, on the
average, twin pregnancies were located
among the latter one-half of all pregnancies,
but the mean maternal age for twin pregnancies was the same as the mean maternal
age for all pregnancies. The mean parity
position for Holmes County twin births is
4,35, which is also in the latter one-half of
the average of 7.19 pregnancies per female.
The mean maternal age for twin births is
30.0 years compared with a mean maternal
age of 29.7 years for all Ohio Amish births.
Although few accurate data are available,
the median age of United States women at
the birth of their last child is probably between 25,5 and 27.5 years, and the average
number of children ever born is approximately 2.35 (Glick, 1957). It is estimated

Amish Demography 97

(Scheinfeld, 1965) that the probability of a
twin birth is increased four-fold for fifth or
sixth pregnancies in mothers aged 35 to 39
compared with primipara 15 to 19 years old.
Therefore, the higher parity and increased
maternal age in Amish mothers alone may
account for the increased frequency of
dizygous twins.

Since some familial aggregation of twinning is present in the Holmes County population, genetic factors cannot be ruled out
entirely, however. Eleven, or 9.9% of the
families with twin births, accounted for
17.5% of all twin births (Table 4),

The Holmes County Amish demonstrate
several characteristics previously noted in
other ethnic groups with high fertility (Juberg, 1966; Sheps, 1965; Henry, 1961;
Tietze, 1957). The more fertile women have
shorter intervals between births, as one
might expect, because the reproductive span
is finite. However, factors other than shortened intervals alone are involved, since such
women also continue reproducing for a
longer period after marriage.

Birth intervals lengthen with increasing
birth order for a given family size. This has
been attributed to maternal aging (Tietze,
1957), although other factors such as parity
and length of cohabitation have not been
ruled out. Even paternal factors may be important in a manner similar to the decrease
in the sex ratio of offspring caused by paternal aging (Novitzki and Kimball, 1958).
Evidence for an effect of parity and against
a maternal age effect alone is suggested by
the fact that mean intervals for a given
birth order are remarkably stable when all
families (with mothers of various ages) are
included.

Other than delayed marriage, the Amish
have not attempted to limit their family size
in the past, and there is no evidence that
their attitudes toward procreation have
changed recently. Smith (1960) found no
increase in the percentage of childless couples and no decrease in the size of Amish
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

98 Cross and MeKusick

families between 1890 and 1949, Among the
northern Indiana Amish, Juberg (1966)
found no evidence that attempts were made
to limit family size. Huntingdon (1956), in
the most recent sociological study of the
Holmes County Amish, concluded that they
do not practice birth control by mechanical
or chemical means, and although a few
couples illegally attempt to use the “rhythm
method,” they have little success. Surgical
sterilization is reserved for exceptional cases.
Two studies (Huntingdon, 1956; Cross,
1967) encompassing a total of 8 years of observation of the Holmes County community
revealed only two couples in whom surgical
sterilization was performed. Direct inquiries
to several Holmes County Amish deacons
brought emphatic denials that birth control
in any form is permitted today.

It was previously noted that the Hutterites have a higher fertility than the
Amish, although the two groups are similar
in standards of living and medical care and
neither apparently uses modern methods of
birth control. Several factors, both cultural
and biological, may explain the differing
reproductive performance since apparently
all act in the same direction.

Firstly, Hutterite women marry about
one year earlier than Amish women. Secondly, the mean interval from marriage to
birth of the first child is 13 months for Hutterite women (Sheps, 1965) compared with
nearly 20 months for Amish women.!
Thirdly, mean intervals between births in
the Hutterites are less than 25 months, and
the longest interval found was that leading
to the thirteenth birth: 24.8 months (Sheps,
1965). Among Amish women, however, all
intervals are greater than 24 months; the
longest is 37.8 months, and the overall average is 28.2 months (Table 8). The number of
years between marriage and birth of the last
child is nearly the same in the two ethnic
groups, although Amish women with smaller

1 However, Sheps’ data on first pregnancies included premarital conceptions.

Social Biology

families actually reproduce 3 to 5 years
longer than do Hutterite women.

The Hutterites provide communal care
and education for all offspring and thus can
accommodate large numbers of offspring
more readily than can the Amish where each
family is individually responsible for all
facets of family hfe and education. That
such cultural factors may play a role is suggested by the nearly equal age-specific nuptial fertility rates among young couples in
both populations followed by a rapid drop in
reproductivity among older Amish women.
Thus, the Amish may be effectively reducing
total family size by means of practices as yet
not admitted or identified.

It is difficult to accept cultural influences
on family planning as playing an important
role, however, since no discernible trend toward smaller Amish families can be detected. Increasing knowledge and availability of contraceptive methods as well as economic pressures due to scarcity and cost of
tillable farmland would lead one to suspect
that, if family limitation is practiced, Amish
families today should be smaller than in previous decades. However, the number of
pregnancies (Table 9) and live births of
women from completed Ohio Amish families
shows no consistent or recent decrease. Similarly, Juberg (1966) found no decrease but
rather a slight increase in mean number of
offspring born to younger mothers. Smith
(1960) also noted a slight increase in the
average number of children born to more
recently married couples compared with all
couples married between 1890 and 1929;
and, in addition, the proportion of Pennsylvania couples with 10 or more children also
increased. These data indicate that the number of offspring per Amish couple has been
nearly constant for at least six decades.
Furthermore, using available estimates of
the growth of the Old Order Amish population in North America (Hostetler, 1963) and
considering that some defections do occur,
the actual growth rate corresponds reason
 

 

 

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

Vol. 17, No. 2

ably well with the calculated potential increase of 145% per generation. From 1905 to
1930, the Amish population increased by
125% and from 1930 to 1960 it increased
134%. Without evidence for any significant
variation in the defection rate during this
period, these figures provide additional evidence for the constancy of Amish fertility
rates throughout this century.

The higher Hutterite fertility is apparently due to shorter birth intervals for whatever reason, A miscarriage or stillbirth
prolongs the interval approximately three
months (Potter, 1963), but there is no evidence of greater pregnancy wastage in the
Amish, The data presented here suggest that
the period of post-partum infecundity is
slightly greater in the Amish, although data
on the length of post-partum amenorrhea
and the number of anovulatory cycles would

 

 

 

 

Amish Demography 99

be required to establish this. A significant
difference in fecundity or probability of conception in the two groups Is suggested by the
fact that nulliparous Amish women require
about seven more months of exposure to the
risk of pregnancy before conception leading
to a livebirth occurs.

SUMMARY

Members of the Old Order Amish who
live in the Holmes County, Ohio, community shun modern means of birth control in
spite of having relatively high standards of
living and medical care. Population studies
of the entire population of 9,724 individuals
were undertaken in 1964.

The broad-based population pyramid of
this community is characteristic of a young
population in which the majority of individuals are under 20 years of age. The social

and cultural isolation of the Amish is reflected in the smoothly tapered appearance
of the pyramid. The overall sex ratio is
nearly unity, but males outnumber females
from birth through 9 years of age and again
among those aged 54 years and older.

The Amish marry later than their peers in
the rest of the United States. The median
age at marriage for members of this community is 23.0 years for females and 24.1
years for males, More than one-third of the
wives are older than their husbands, Amish
weddings are highly seasonal, although data
from more recent years suggest that preference for the winter months is becoming less
pronounced. The sect is strictly endogamous
as evidenced by the fact that mates are
chosen only from (1) within the community,
(2) other Amish communities with close social and genealogical ties, and (3) other, less
closely related, Amish communities, in the
given order of preference.

In spite of strong social and religious pressures against premarital intercourse, about
7% of all marriages among the Holmes
County Amish produce a live birth within
eight months after marriage. However, few
Amish children are illegitimate since the
biological parents usually marry.

Delayed marriage is the only detectable
means of family limitation. Consequently,

Social Biology

this community has a crude birth rate comparable to that in the United States in 1900,
and a fertility ratio more than 50% greater
than the ratio present among all rural white
inhabitants of the same area in the United
States in 1900. The age-standardized nuptial
birth rate is low among 15 to 19 year olds,
reaches a peak among women aged 25 to 29,
and drops rapidly thereafter. Amish women
have a median number of 6.66 livebirths,
and the intrinsic rate of natural increase indicates a potential doubling of population
size every 23 years.

Characteristics of Amish birth intervals
are similar to those found among other high
fertility groups. The more fertile Amish
women generally have shorter intervals between births but also tend to have a longer
reproductive span. Birth intervals are positively correlated with increasing birth order
among families of a given size. The mean
interval from marriage to the first birth, excluding premarital conceptions, is nearly 20
