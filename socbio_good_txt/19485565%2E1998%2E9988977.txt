in Life Expectancy in Mauritius

ABSTRACT: This study applies two methodologies to Mauritian life tables and cause-of-death
data: (1) the decomposition of sex differentials in life expectancy using Arriaga’s approach and
(2) the estimation of the effect of marginal reduction in deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases on life expectancy using Keyfitz’s methodology on cause-specific entropy and that of
Nanjo. The findings in this paper support earlier findings about the importance of the period
1969-1976 in the mortality transition in Mauritius, a period in which sex differentials in life expectancies reached a peak level. The results suggest that the driving force behind those sex differentials in life expectancy was the sex differential in mortality in infectious and parasitic diseases, first among the young (ages below 10 years) and second among the older population (ages
above 50 years). If the decline in mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases was differentially greater in the older ages compared to the younger ages, that difference would have gone a
long way toward reducing the magnitude of the historic peak sex differential in life expectancy

achieved in 1976.

The higher mortality of males over females is not generalized, but is limited to
certain causes of death. This realization
prompted researchers to focus on the contribution of certain causes of death to sex
differentials in mortality. In linking
causes of death to age-sex differentials in
mortality at a point in time, the central
concern is to find out first the age groupings where the increase in sex mortality
differentials have been greatest and, second, the causes of death that have been
responsible.

When the study period extends over
several years, so that sex differentials in
mortality change over time as well as
age-cause-specific death rates, the problem becomes more technical. In this paper, the study period chosen spans 17

260

years, from 1969 to 1986, and the focus
is on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius which has experienced one of the
most spectacular declines in mortality in
the Third World. In four decades, from
1942-46 to 1982-84, life expectancy at
birth in Mauritius increased from 32.8 to
64.38 years for males and from 33.8 to
71.23 years for females. This sharp decline in mortality was accompanied by a
drastic shift in the cause-of-death structure and remarkable change in sex-differentials in mortality.

The period under study, 1969-86,
marked a transitional phase in mortality
decline in Mauritius. The decline in mortality was not as rapid as earlier, while
the sex differential in mortality was quite
substantial. The historical mortality data

of Mauritius show that it is one of the few
countries where there has been a turnaround from excess female mortality between ages | and 40 in the period prior to
1972 to one of excess male mortality after 1972 (CSO, 1988). This change
makes the period under study an interesting one with respect to sex differentials in
mortality.

The group of causes of death selected
for study is that of infectious and parasitic diseases. This group was among the
leading causes of death in Mauritius in
1969 for both males and females. The importance of this group declined over the
study period, but not in a smooth manner.
The periods 1977-78 and 1982-83
marked two breaks when the death rates
for infectious and parasitic diseases for
males fell to much lower levels. In between these breaks, the rates were almost
stationary, and prior to 1977, the rate of
decline was slow.

For females, the death rates for infectious and parasitic diseases experienced
very rapid decline between 1973 and
1978 which was followed by an almost
constant trend in the rates over the next
four years. Following that, over the period 1982-83, the death rates for infectious and parasitic diseases for females
experienced another sharp decline. In
general, over the period 1969 to 1986, the
death rates for infectious and parasitic
diseases declined by more than half for
males and about three-quarters for females. Despite this decline, the group of
infectious and parasitic diseases did not
lose its importance in Mauritius. By
1986, deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases comprised the second leading cause of death after deaths due to diseases of the circulatory system (Bah,
1992).

Age-sex Differentials

 

261

From here a faint link emerges between a specific cause of death, age patterns of mortality (and by extension, life
expectancies), and sex differential in
mortality. The aim of this paper is to explore this link. It is a technical study on
the contribution of age-sex differentials in
causes of death due to infectious and parasitic diseases to the trends in age-sex
differentials in life expectancy in Mauritius.

LITERATURE REVIEW

In the mainstream demographic literature, an epic study in analyzing the contribution of cause of death to increase in
sex differentials in mortality was the
work by Enterline (1961). He introduced
a new methodology for obtaining the
contributions of causes of death to sex ratios of age-standardized death rates. He
addressed this problem using data from
the United States and found that between
1920 and 1960 the largest increases in
sex mortality differentials occurred in the
age groups 15-24 and 45-64. Enterline
found that the trends in death rates for tuberculosis, maternal mortality, and motor
vehicle accidents were primarily responsible for increases in the age group
15-24. On the other hand, the causes of
death responsible for the increases in the
45-54 age group were certain cancers
and coronary heart disease. Later on, several researchers readdressed this problem,
shifting away from standardized death
rates as the measure of mortality and instead giving a central place to life expectancy.

The literature provides evidence that
males tend to have higher death rates than
females for infectious and parasitic diseases, particularly for ages above 30. In

the case of Mauritius, a previous study
has shown the importance of cause-ofdeath structure in determining age patterns of mortality. It was found that
cause-of-death structure had greater influence on age patterns of mortality for
males than for females. Specifically, for
both males and females, the most prominent causes of death affecting age patterns of mortality were infectious and
parasitic diseases and circulatory causes
of death. The greatest effect of infectious
and parasitic diseases on age patterns of
mortality was on the young ages below
20 (Bah, 1994).

In another study, Bah and Teklu
(1992) compared the age patterns of mortality in Mauritius over the same study
period with those of the Coale-Demeny
and United Nations model life tables. For
males aged less than 10 years, a persistent pattern which emerged prior to 1978
was the similarity which the age patterns
of mortality bore with the United Nations
South Asian model and to some extent
with the Coale-Demeny South model.
However, after 1978, no one model could
be singled out that showed consistent
similarity with the age pattern of mortality for young Mauritian males.

The several models which showed best
fit included models from both the CoaleDemeny and United Nations model life
tables. For females aged less than 10, no
persistent pattern emerged, whether prior
to 1978 or after. For ages above 10, the
age pattern of mortality for males was
found to be persistently similar to that of
the United Nations Far Eastern model.
For females, just as in the case of young
Mauritian males, different periods
showed different patterns. For the period
prior to 1980 no model life table could be
singled out which showed a persistent fit.

For the period 1980-82, the United Nations General model showed best fit
while for the period 1983-86, the South
Asian model consistently showed best fit.
Concerning these observations, the explanation offered was as follows:

(F)or males, marked reductions took place
in the rates from infectious and parasitic
diseases for ages under five over the period
1969 to 1980. It is therefore possible that it
was this sharp decline in childhood mortality in Mauritius over the period 1977-1978
that made the childhood mortality pattern
for Mauritian males to be no longer similar
to the South Asian model (which is characterized by its high childhood mortality)
(Bah and Teklu, 1992, pp. 52-53).

The second part of the analysis is
based on the Keyfitz approach. It is in
this approach that the useful concept of H
or entropy was introduced. In the context
of mortality, H is defined as the weighted
average of the logarithm of the life table
survivorship function and is expressed as
follows:

DE354 =

H= ~ J Ux)finl(x)]Jdx

j I(x)dx

Its usefulness lies in the fact that it
gives the percentage change in life expectancy produced by a reduction of 1
per cent in the force of mortality at all
ages. Keyfitz (1977) had shown that if
mortality at all ages changes by 1006 the
effect of this change on life expectancy
will be as follows:

Ae(0)/e(0)=—HB .

After Keyfitz introduced H, it has been
extended by several researchers. Goldman and Lord (1986) as well as Vaupel
(1986) derived an alternative expression
for H. Goldman and Lord (1986) proved
that H is not bounded by 1.0 as had been
previously assumed by some researchers.

Age-sex Differentials

263

Goldman and Lord (1987) re-expressed H
as follows:

_ J d(x)e(x)dx as e(0)

Written this way, H can be viewed as the
average years of future lifetime that are
lost by observed deaths. Alternatively, the
numerator of H can be viewed as the
weighted average of life expectancies at
age x (since [%, d(x) dx = 1) From this
basic definition of entropy, H, and making the assumption of independence between the probability of surviving against
the risk of a specific cause of death and
that against the risk of all other deaths, it
has been shown that cause-specific entropy for cause i, H; can be expressed as:

__ f Ux)fInl fx) Jax
H,= —————_"
J U(x)dx

Thus, cause-specific entropy for cause i,
H, can be viewed as the average years of
future lifetime that are lost by deaths due
to cause 1. The expression for H, has been
simplified for computational purposes by
Nanjo (1980). Using a different approach,
he was able to derive coefficients that enable one to compute values for H, as well
as values for specific age groups.
According to Nanjo (1980),

Ae(0) = (—6(0))C(0) + (—8(5))C(5) +
wees (5(85))C (85)

where

C(x) SS 1 (Nx t5)+(S—A ull)

where x=0,5,10....0, VY, = D{x,n)!D(x,n)

and Co) =

T(x), I(x), A@n) are standard life table
functions and D{x,n) is the number of
deaths from cause 7 occurring in the age
group x to x+n and D(x,n) is the total
number of deaths occurring in the age
group x to xn.

One convenience of Nanjo’s approach
is that once the coefficients have been obtained, the change in life expectancy
Ae(0) can easily be obtained for different
marginal age-specific reduction in cause
of death. It would not be possible to do
this kind of analysis using Arriaga’s approach. Also, using Nanjo’s coefficients,
cause-specific entropy values (for ages 0
and over) can be easily obtained by the
following formula:

H, = Ae(0)/*e(0)) = & C{x)/e(0)

where 8(0) = 8(1) =
...0(85) = 6.

To mention in passing, it must be
noted that an alternative computational
expression for H , (x) has been provided
by Namboodiri and Suchindran (1987, p.
107) as follows:

H{x) =1 Do

¥ =;

8(5) = 8(10) =

lity) *l(y)
M,; + ,M,

(1—exp[n*(,,M, ;+ ,M,))

This expression has not been used in
this paper. Instead, Nanjo’s approach has
been employed.

The data used was obtained from the
WHO mortality data bank. The causes of
death in that data bank were classified according to the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD). Over the period under

Bah

study, two versions of the ICD were used:
the eighth revision of the ICD (ICD-8)
from 1969 to 1980, and the ninth revision
(ICD-9), from 1981 to 1986. The number
of deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases were grouped together for each year
by age and sex. The deaths for all the
causes of death were used to obtain total or
overall mortality by age and sex. These
data, in conjunction with population data,
were used to obtain age-specific death rates
as well as age-cause-specific death rates.
These overall age-specific death rates
served as input data into the United Nations
Mortpak software to obtain life tables.
These life tables were used, first as input
data into a program used to apply Arriaga’s
methodology, and second in conjunction
with age-cause-specific and overall death
rates, as input data into another program to
obtain age-cause-specific entropy values.

RESULTS

Tables 1 and 2 give the life expectancies at various ages for males and females respectively. For males, the period
1969-76 was a period of loss in the mortality gains that had been accrued over
the previous three decades. This period
witnessed reversal in mortality decline
with life expectancies declining at all
ages, except for life expectancy at birth.
The life expectancy at birth showed a
very slight rise over the period 1973-76.
Recovery in health gains started after
1976 and continued till 1986. For females, there were gains in life expectancy
throughout the period of study. The pace
of increase in life expectancy was uniform during the 1970’s and slowed down
during the 1980’s.

life expectancies between females and

even though it was still higher than that of
males. Over the period 1980-86, when
males started to experience recovery in
mortality decline, the sex differentials
correspondingly narrowed down.

Table 3 gives the contribution of sex
differential in mortality at each age group
to the total sex differential in life expectancy at birth for Mauritius for selected
years between 1969 and 1986. For brevity,
only the percentage distributions of the total effects are shown (full decomposition
into direct effects, indirect effects, and interaction effects available from the author
upon request). From Table 3 it can be seen
that for 1969 and 1973 mortality differential in age group 0-1 made the greatest
contribution (about 20 per cent) to sex differentials in life expectancies, followed by
mortality differential in old age groups
50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, and 70-74.
In 1976, the contribution of mortality differential in the age group 0—1 had dropped
to about 10 per cent while those in the old
age groups had risen to about 13 per cent.

 

In 1980, the turning point was reached. As
Table 3 shows, the contribution of age
group 0-1 had dropped drastically to less
than 3 per cent while that of the age group
60-64 reached a peak of about 17 per
cent. Over the period 1983-86 mortality in
the older ages was making more significant contributions to sex differentials in
life expectancy than mortality in the
younger ages.

Tables 4 and 5 give Nanjo’s coefficients
for males and females respectively. From
these two sets of coefficients, aggregated
values were obtained and are shown in
Table 6. The aggregated values in Table 6
form the basis for obtaining the entropy
values for infectious and parasitic diseases
shown in Table 7. Finally, using the aggregated coefficients, we calculated changes in
life expectancy when death rates due to infectious and parasitic diseases are reduced
at varying rates for different broad age
groups. We show these results in Table 8.

With improvement in mortality from
infectious disease, entropy values drop for

was a decreasing importance of this group
of cause of death over time.

Of more interest are the results in Table
8. It can be seen that if death rates due to
infectious and parasitic diseases are hypothetically reduced by 1 per cent in all age
groups, life expectancy for males would
increase by about 0.06 a year in 1969, declining over time to about 0.016 in 1986.
The gains in life expectancy for females
are comparable to those of males but are
slightly higher in 1969-73 and in 1980. If
the infectious disease death rate is hypothetically reduced by 2 per cent for the age
group 0-9 and 1 per cent for ages above
10, the magnitude of the gains in life expectancy would increase for all years for
both males and females. However, the pattern of difference between the gains in life
expectancy for males and females would
remain the same. It is only if the 2 per cent
decline is applied to ages above 50 that the
pattern would change. The results in the
last panel in Table 8 shows that under such
a reduction male and female gains in life
expectancy would be very close except for
1976 and 1983. In other words, if the decline in mortality due to infectious and
parasitic diseases was differentially greater
in the older ages compared to the younger
ages, that would have gone a long way toward narrowing the sex differential in life
expectancy prior to 1976.

DISCUSSION

Within the wider context, the main issue addressed in this paper is the contribution of age-sex differentials in causes
of death to age-sex differentials in mortality. In this study, the focus had been on
infectious and parasitic diseases which
played an important role in the mortality
transition in Mauritius. Prior research had

Age-sex Differentials 269

shown that for Mauritian males, infectious and parasitic diseases played an important role in determining the age pattern of mortality among males for ages
below 20 for the period around 1978,
while for ages above 20 diseases of the
circulatory system played a more important role (Bah, 1994).

There were some specific health-inhibiting factors that emerged around the
period 1975-77 which need to be highlighted. It was in 1975 that cyclone Gervaise struck the island and destroyed
8,000 dwelling units. Subsequent to the
arrival of this cyclone, there was an upsurge in the number of malaria cases. The
magnitude of this reversal can be appreciated when considering that two years earlier, in 1973, WHO had granted Mauritius
the certificate of malaria eradication
(Central Statistical Office, 1988). During
this period, the mortality of males rose
far higher than that of females. As a result, the sex differentials in mortality in
Mauritius rose from 1969, reaching a
peak in 1976.

During the study period, there were
hardly any gains in life expectancy among
males, while for females there were gains
in life expectancy throughout the period.
The study has shown that it was the age
group 0-1 that made the greatest contribution to sex differentials in life expectancies
over the period 1969-73. In this early period, Mauritius was still largely an agrobased economy with a sugar monoculture.
A boom in the economy only began in
1974. Since the population is largely South
Asian in composition, the effect of some
South Asian cultural traits could be seen.
One such effect was the slight excess of female mortality between ages 1 and 40 (as
seen from the ratio of age-specific death
rates) prior to 1972 (Central Statistical

co Office, 1988). For infants, these sociocultural traits did not have an effect, possibly
‘gdue to the stronger influence of the health
cocare system.

As Mauritius was experiencing rapid
= socioeconomic development in the late
© 1970’s, modernizing influences worked in
opposition to health-inhibiting cultural
traits and resulted in a dissimilarity in age
patterns of mortality between that of Mau
itius and of South Asia. Over the period
1983-86, which is clearly a modern phase
in the mortality pattern of Mauritius, it
was mortality in the older ages that was
making the more significant contribution
to sex differentials in life expectancies.
Perhaps the most interesting result is that
the peak sex difference in life expectancy
in 1976 and 1980 appears to be due prnimarily to the peak contributions from
about ages 50-74 in those years.

When the contribution of deaths due to
infectious and parasitic diseases was analyzed using cause-specific entropy, the results reaffirmed previous findings, namely
that deaths due to infectious and parasitic
diseases were no longer a serious threat

among females after 1980 while before
that they were more serious for males than
females. When the analysis was extended
to cover the gains in life expectancy due to
marginal reductions in infectious disease
mortality, crucial differences appeared. A
1 per cent reduction in infectious disease
mortality in all ages would give rise to
higher gains in life expectancy for females
than males only prior to 1980 (with the exception of 1976). After 1980, the gain in
life expectancy would be higher for males
than females. The effect of higher decline
in the young ages relative to the other ages
would be to increase the magnitude of
gains in life expectancy but not to change
the pattern of difference in the gains in life
expectancies between males and females.
The same is true for differential increase
in the decline in the childhood and adult
ages. However, the effect of differential increase in the decline in infectious diseases
mortality in the old ages is to change both
the magnitude of gains in life expectancy
and the pattern of difference in the gains.
If the decline in mortality due to infectious
and parasitic diseases was differentially

greater in the older ages compared to the
younger ages, the peak sex differential in
life expectancy reached in 1976 would
have been lesser in magnitude.

CONCLUSIONS

Several findings emerge from this paper. First, methodologically, the approach
of the Keyfitz/Nanjo school and that of
Pollard/Arriaga are not necessarily alternative ways of analyzing age-sex differentials in life expectancy. Rather, both approaches are relevant in providing the
complete picture. Arriaga’s approach is
more useful in assessing the contribution
of age-sex differential in overall mortality
to that of life expectancy. This assessment
is important in the first stage of an analysis
on trends in age-sex differential in life expectancy. However, when the problem addressed goes beyond assessing the contribution of differentials in mortality to
differentials in life expectancies to include
cause-specific effect, Arriaga’s approach
alone cannot suffice. There is need then to
measure the effect of marginal reduction
in death rates due to the specific cause of
death on life expectancy. Further developments in the Keyfitz approach have made
it possible for cause-specific mortality to
be included in the discourse. Nanjo’s approach is useful in bringing in the causespecific component and in assessing the
importance of those same age groupings
to sex differentials in life expectancy.

Second, the study has captured some of
the changes that took place in a crucial era
in the mortality transition in Mauritius.
The 1970’s saw the change in mortality
pattern from a South Asian type to one
drastically different from it. As Mauritian
mortality entered a modern phase, old age
mortality and mortality from noncommu
 

Age-sex Differentials 271

nicable diseases played a major role in determining life expectancies. While Mauritian females suffered a health disadvantage
in the past, as was the case in other South
Asian populations, improvement in health
of both males and females saw the reversal
of this female disadvantage. Since females
usually have lower death rates than males
for causes of death due to infectious and
parasitic diseases, the reduction in infectious and parasitic diseases, at the time
when that group of causes of death was
the leading cause of death, was translated
into widening differentials in life expectancies. This situation, in addition to
the excess male mortality that arose from
the change in the cause of death structure
in Mauritius, led to the peak sex differential in life expectancy in 1976. There is little likelihood that the 1976 peak in sex
differential in life expectancy will be repeated again in Mauritius. As Mauritius
has shed the female health-inhibiting characteristics borrowed from the South Asian
cultural heritage, sex differential in life expectancy is expected to narrow, especially
in the older ages.

Finally, the findings in this paper support
earlier findings about the importance of the
period 1969-76 in the mortality transition
that Mauritius underwent—the period in
which sex differentials in life expectancies
reached a peak level. Whereas previous research emphasized the importance of infectious diseases on survivorship in younger
ages, this research adds to that finding the
importance of infectious diseases in older
ages. According to the findings in this paper,
the driving force behind those sex differentials in life expectancy was sex differential
in mortality in infectious and parasitic diseases first among the young ages below 10
years followed by among the older ages
above 50 years.
