ABSTRACT: Child mortality experience may affect subsequent fertility of couples by exerting the
so-called “‘physiological’’ and/or “‘replacement” responses. The influence of either effect should
become apparent upon an examination of individual reproductive histories. The impact of infant and early childhood mortality on subsequent reproductive behavior of couples is analyzed
for the presence and intensity of these effects. Historical data are derived from 1,261 families in
two communities in western Massachusetts. Relationships of intervals between successive confinements, and parity progression ratios, according to the fate of previous births, are examined.
While forms of family limitation have been employed by the study population, indicating that
the capacity for replacement existed, the data do not reveal any significant attempt at child

replacement.

Demographers have generally accepted the proposition, which gained salience with the formulation of the demographic transition theory, that couples
respond to declines in child mortality by
having fewer births (Heer and Smith,
1968; Schultz, 1976). This proposition,
in turn, is partly founded on the assumption that parents compensate for child
mortality with higher fertility in order to
“replace” any lost children. However,
existing empirical evidence has not provided us with a clear understanding of
the role of behavioral and biological factors in determining the response of fertility to mortality. Recent research into
the child replacement effect remains
somewhat equivocal (e.g., see Preston,
1978). The purpose of this paper is to review current thought on the role of these
factors and to shed light on the patterns
reflected in a historical population from
rural New England.

A child mortality experience may affect the subsequent fertility of couples in
two ways: (1) The loss of a child (infant

218

in particular) may exert a so-called
“physiological effect.” This effect will
be most pronounced in breastfeeding
populations where the fate of an infant
influences the length of birth interval,
either by shortening or lengthening of
lactation which inhibits conception
through prolonging of postpartum
amenorrhea (Knodel and van de Walle,
1967; Jain et al., 1970; Saxena, 1977).
(2) The second effect is known as the
“child replacement effect,” and it suggests that couples who lose children relatively early in their reproductive life
continue to procreate in an attempt to
reach a desired number of surviving offspring. Fundamental to the operation of
this effect is the assumption that couples
are capable of, and practice, some form
of family limitation.

If these effects are operating, they
should become evident upon an examination of individual reproductive histories. However, where biological constraints are potentially important, it may
be very difficult to distinguish between

 
Vol. 30, No. 2

purely physiological and purely behavioral components of the process regulating reproduction. The natural spacing of
births and the onset of sterility may be
affected by general health, diet, and
prior childbearing and breastfeeding
practices. These biological pressures
can, in turn, be influenced behaviorally
both by social custom and individual
choice.

The physiological effect of infant

mortality on subsequent fertility has
been reported in many studies. Much
less effort has been made, particularly in
historical demographic studies, to examine the replacement hypothesis (ex© ceptions include Knodel, 1968, 1970,
“1978, 1982; Smith, 1972; Matthiessen

may have been that most historical demographic studies have dealt with prein< dustrial populations in which fertility

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A total of 1,261 families of married
women born between 1801 and 1880
were reconstituted for the towns of Deerfield (N=915) and Shelburne
(N=346) of Franklin County in Western Massachusetts. Vital registers were
the primary source of data, and federal
censuses and town genealogies served as
independent checks. Approximately 40
per cent of all families in both communities were in full observation—from the
birth of the woman to the death or survival to adulthood (age 21) of her eldest

child. Even though this is not a random
sample, we believe that it is representative of those who remained in these
communities for the duration of their
childbearing. For the purpose of this
analysis, families of foreign-born parents were excluded because of their different mortality and fertility patterns
(Temkin-Greener and Swedlund, ms.).
Jn addition, families of women born after 1860 were excluded from the replacement analysis because they could
not be traced until the end of their reproductive cycle. Consequently, this
study covers the fertility and mortality
events from the early 1720’s until the
turn of the twentieth century. During
this time Deerfield was primarily agricultural with some industrial development, while Shelburne witnessed a
greater dependence on manufacturing
in the mid and late nineteenth century.

RESULTS

During this time period, these essentially rural western Massachusetts communities were undergoing mortality and
fertility transitions (Figures 1 and 2). In
Deerfield, a secular decline in fertility
had already begun by the turn of the
nineteenth century. Family size had declined from a high of between 7.5-8.0
children for women born between 1721~
1740 and 1741-1760 respectively, to 5.8
for women born 1761-1780 and 5.4 for
those born before 1800 (Table 1). Fertility transition in Deerfield continued
during the time period covered by this
study. Mean number of children ever
born to native Deerfield women declined further to 3.9 for the cohort born
1841-1860.

In Shelburne, fertility transition began later but proceeded at a very fast
pace once on its way. Shelburne women

born between 1761 and 1780 had an average of 8.4 children. But the cohort of
1801-1820 already had an average of 5.2
births, and the next cohort born between 1821-1840 gave birth to a mean of
3.7 children, i.e., below the level of Deerfield fertility.

The declines in family size may have
come about as a result of various
involuntary—for example, age-atmarriage increase—as well as volitional
factors. During the first phase of fertility
transition in Deerfield, age at marriage
for women increased by 2.8 years (Table
1) as mean completed family size declined by 2.6 children (from 8.0 to 5.4).
Given the mean birth interval of 27.8
months for the two cohorts, it appears
that the increase in the age at marriage
may have been responsible for approximately 50 per cent of the observed decline in cohort fertility, For the cohorts
born after 1800, mean age at marriage
fluctuations were negligible and appear
to have had little effect on the declining
completed family size. In Shelburne, the
initial decline in family size (from 8.4 to
6.9 children per completed family), al
though significant at the 0.005 level, appears to have been due almost entirely
to a higher age at marriage for women
born 1781-1800. Later declines in family
size can not be easily attributed to the
changing age of entrance into marriage.

Substantial empirical evidence indicates that the observed patterns of fertility transition were characteristic of family limiting behavior. The cohort
age-specific fertility patterns indicate
that the reduction in the overall fertility
level in both communities was paritydependent and directed at stopping
childbeating at some given range of family size (Figures 3 and 4). In populations
exhibiting family limiting behavior, fertility of women at older ages is expected
to be especially low. Analysis of variance performed on the four age groups
over 30 years of age for the periods of
greatest fertility change shows significant differences between the cohorts in
Deerfield (p < 0.001) and in Shelburne
(p < 0.05). Age groups under 30 did
not differ significantly.

In Deerfield of the early 1700’s mortality was generally low, reflecting both

a young population as well as a comparatively good level of health in this rural,
relatively isolated New England community. But approximately at the time
of the first fertility transition, 1.e.,
around 1800, a real increase in general
mortality appears to have occurred
(Meindl and Swedlund, 1977). The increase was independent of the changing
age structure of the population. It affected all age categories and continued
into the 1850's. Shelburne followed a
similar trend but experienced a considerably higher level of mortality than Deerfield prior to the 1860's.

The mortality decline coincided with
a second fertility transition in Deerfield
as well as with one experienced by
Shelburne families. It is this combination of events which make the time period under study particularly amenable
to the analysis of the child replacement
hypothesis.

In the subsequent discussion, the
events in Deerfield and Shelburne are
pooled to increase observations and
possible inference. Despite some differences in historical experience the two
communities can be expected to behave
similarly with respect to attitudes toward replacement. An examination of
intervals between successive births, according to the fate of the infant at the beginning of the interval, shows some difference depending on infant death or
survival. The mean birth interval following infant survival was 30.8 months
while that following infant death was
25.7 months.

We have no direct information about
breastfeeding practices in the study population and therefore can not attribute
any part of the observed difference directly to the influence of lactation on fecundity and fertility. However, the gen
Child Replacement Hypothesis

223

eral literature of the day on child care
suggests that breastfeeding was prevalent. Breastfeeding has been shown to
effectively lengthen the duration of
post-partum ammenhorrea by as much
as ten months (Potter et al., 1965; van
Ginniken, 1974) in the absence of mortality. The results of studies in developing countries and of historical populations consistently show that the death of
an infant is equivalent to weaning in its
impact on subsequent birth interval
(Cantrelle et al., 1978; Knodel, 1978).
One way of eliminating the contribution of breastfeeding is to examine the
effect which the fate of the first-born
child has on the interval between the
second and third confinements (Knodel,
1978, 1982). Since the death or survival
of the first born does not affect the duration of breastfeeding of the second
child, the interval between parity 2 and3
should reflect any attempts at child replacement, had they occurred. The possible effect of mortality risks of siblings
being correlated is eliminated by holding constant the fate of the second-born
child. Our results should be interpreted
with caution due to the small number of
cases in particular categories (Table 2).
{t was expected that the interval between second and third confinements
would be shorter when a first-born dies
in infancy than when it survives. This relationship holds only when the second
child dies before reaching age one, and
its impact is approximately nine months.
As expected, the interval between the
second and third child is shortest when
the first two children die. It is interesting
to observe that the difference in the
length of the interval between second
and third children is not statistically
significant (p > 0.05), regardless of the
fate of the first-born, when the second

born survives (Table 2). In contrast,
when the second-born dies in infancy
the difference in the birth interval from
second to third child is statistically significant (p < 0.05), depending on
whether the first born dies also or survives. In the case of the former, we
would interpret data as indicating that
no immediate replacement was attempted, at least during the early stages
of family formation (i.e., for the first
three children born). The latter case is
more complicated to interpret for even
though the intervals appear to suggest
replacement it is not easy to distinguish
between a “‘true replacement”’ and simply an attempt by parents to have a
child.

The data suggest, at best, weak support for the replacement hypothesis.
The distribution of the sample sizes is itself symptomatic of a relatively low level
of infant mortality, at least within the
first three confinements. We must emphasize that even when birth intervals
do not offer support for the replacement
hypothesis, the attempt at replacement
may still operate and may occur at any
time during the reproductive cycle of a
couple. The age and parity of a woman
will, however, affect her fecundity, and
her own as well as her infant’s health.

Temkin-Greener and Swedlund

Social Biology

If a couple’s experience with child
mortality influences their childbearing
so as to encourage replacement of lost
children, one may expect that (for couples with the same number of live confinements) the probability of “moving”
from parity n to parity n+1 will be
greater for those couples who experienced child loss than for those who did
not (Knodel, 1978). This part. of the
analysis involves the loss of all children
who died before their mothers conceived again. As it is shown in Table 3,
the decline in parity progression ratios is
consistently less at each parity for
women who did not experience child
death. However, the results for the
study population do not exhibit a relationship between parity progression ratios and the experience of child mortality which is consistent with the child
replacement hypothesis (Table 3); nor
are the values as high as might be expected in some historical populations
(e.g., see Knodel, 1978, 1982) or in developing countries (e.g., see Rutstein
and Medica, 1978). One may have expected that women experiencing child

loss would be more likely to continue
childbearing than women who did not
experience any loss. In fact, the opposite is true. Although the number of
cases (n= 47) for the categories of twoplus child deaths is rather small and may
have affected the results, the number of
cases in the one-child death category are
sufficiently large to be meaningful
(n=226).
..__ Perhaps one reason for the observed
2 © negative association between parity pro5 5 gression ratios and the number of prior
E = child deaths is that women who experi3 ence fetal wastage are less likely than
S those who do not experience it to attain
S next liye parity. Since the data in our
o « study refer to live births only, the rela“tionship between total efforts at repro8 duction and mortality becomes somewhat obscured. Zimmer (1979) has

Sthat although women who have had

‘Zhave more subsequent wastage and

women in this sample had a small average number of live births, 2.2. The average age at which they gave birth to their
last child was 35. Four women died before reaching the age of 45. Thus maternal mortality alone does not seem to explain the low levels of parity progression
for these women. The average age of

225

women upon death of a child was 36
(s?=5.0). We suggest that the women
who were least likely to replace a lost
child were (1) aiming for a small completed family size; and/or (2) perhaps
too old upon a child’s death to successfully progress to the next parity.

Our position is that these values
reflect reasonable rates of parity progression in a population with low average parity and low infant mortality. That
is, as noted above, the total fertility of
this group of women was consistently
declining to a low of approximately 3.9
children by the 1841-1860 cohort.
Moreover, although slight increases in
mortality occurred over the time period
discussed, infant mortality was probably
on the order of only 12 per cent, which is
relatively low for nineteenth century
rates (Meindl, 1979). If average parity is
low and family limitation is being practiced, then it is not surprising that only
60 per cent of those families with two
child deaths would proceed to parities
three and higher. In addition, it is our
opinion that adjustment for maternal
age, as performed by Knodel (1982) on
his German village populations, would
evaluate the ratios reported here. Unfortunately, our families are too few in
number to further partition the data.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have been able to establish that the necessary precondition
for measuring the behavioral aspects of
child replacement was present in the
western Massachusetts study population; that is, family limitation was being
practiced. The data also clearly indicate
that a reduction in infant mortality is not
a prerequisite for the onset of family
limitation. However, the data at hand

pothesis for Deerfield and Shelburne
families during the time of fertility transition in these communities. Furthermore, it is difficult to clearly identify the
influence of mortality on fertility in the
presence of other, perhaps confounding, factors. It is conceivable that in
some cases those who experienced child
loss cannot, rather than do not wish to,
replace that loss. Maternal physiological
resources expended on each child are
likely to be gravidity and age dependent. Both factors may not only affect
child survival but may effectively diminish subsequent fecundity and fertility.

A number of other conditions may
account for the observed lack of child replacement effect. First, in populations
undergoing fertility transition with
rather imperfect contraceptive technology, as was the case with the study popujation, parents may still expect to bear
more than the “desired” number of offspring. Second, preference for the sex of
children should effectively weaken the
overall replacement effect since the
death of a child of “‘undesired” sex will
not be replaced (Preston, 1978). Any
behavior in pursuit of a particular sex
would have to be quite strong to result in
a demonstrable demographic effect
(Knodel and De Vos, 1980). Based on
the sex ratio of last births and on parity
progression ratios, there is some indication of preference for males in Deerfield
but not in Shelburne. Given small sample sizes in categories with child deaths,
rather weak indications of sex preference, and no support for the child replacement hypothesis it seems unlikely
that further investigation of replacement by sex of child would yield additional information. Third, replacement
need not be an immediate and full response to a loss but an incomplete response which occurs at the very end of
the childbearing cycle.

Temkin-Greener and Swedlund

 

Social Biology

Although this paper has shed some
light on the observable patterns present
in nineteenth-century New England, the
precise relationship between fertility
and child mortality remain far from
clear. Past assumptions have usually included the notion that infant mortality
was to be avoided at all costs and that in
populations where high fertility is either
valued and/or unavoided, the act of reproductive compensation for a loss
would be very common. It appears that
while child replacement may be present
in some societies, it is relatively inefficient and perhaps infrequent (Preston,
1978, pp. 11-12).

To these concerns we must add the
more important observation made by
Scrimshaw (1978), Polgar (1972), and
others, regarding the fact that in many
high fertility-high mortality situations
the parents stoically “permit” or even
contribute to a certain fraction of avoidable infant mortality. This is a marked
distinction from simply expecting some
infant deaths to occur.

If nothing else, the lesson from traditional societies at this point, whether
they are historical or contemporary, is
that parents are not passive participants
in a natural regime of births and deaths.
The Deerfield and Shelburne inhabitants were actively participating in fertility reduction, and to the extent that
child replacement was desired, some
compensation was certainly possible.
The results of this study do not indicate
that child replacement was practiced to
any significant degree.
