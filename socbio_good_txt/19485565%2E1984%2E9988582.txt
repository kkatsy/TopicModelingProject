The Effect of Female Education on Marital Fertility
in Different Size Communities of Mexico

ABSTRACT: Based on a very large sample of married women aged 15 to 49 from the 1970 census
of Mexico, the effect of literacy and education on the number of children ever born in different
size communities is investigated. While cumulative marital fertility tends to be inversely related
to community size, the overall shape of the education-fertility relationship is generally similar
in rural, semi-urban, small urban, and large urban localities. These results combined with those
for literacy do not support the hypothesis of an urbanization or a literacy “threshold’’ at which

women’s schooling begins to reduce family size.

In a very thorough review of the literature, Cochrane (1979) presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of education on fertility. Her
model, an elaboration of one developed
by Easterlin (1975), hypothesizes that
fertility is determined by the potential
biological supply of children, by parental demand for children, and by fertility
regulation. Briefly, education can increase the supply of children through
better health and greater fecundity, or
education can decrease the potential
number of children through raising the
age at first marriage and consequently
reducing exposure to pregnancy. Increasing amounts of schooling generally
decrease the demand for children by
changing traditional values and altering
the perceived economic costs and
benefits of children. By creating more
positive attitudes toward contraception
and by improving knowledge of birth
control techniques, education typically
promotes fertility regulation.

Increasing amounts of education are

usually, but not always, found to be associated with lower fertility in less developed countries (Williams, 1976; Graff,
1979; Cochrane, 1979; Jain, 1981). For
Latin America, the results of aggregate
fertility studies using literacy or educational attainment as the independent
variable show mixed results (Heer and
Turner, 1965; Stycos, 1968, 1982;
Zarate, 1967; Hicks, 1974; Seiver, 1975;
Beaver, 1975).! With a few exceptions
(Davidson, 1973; Smith, 1981), individual level studies tend to more consistently report a negative relation between
education and fertility (Gendell, et al.,
1967; Rosen and Simmons, 1971;
CELADE/CFSC, 1972; Uthoff and
Gonzales, 1976; Weeks, 1978; Lerner,
1979; Secretaria de Programacion y Presupuesto, 1979).

1980.

As a question for further research,
Cochrane (1979) suggests that we need
to examine why an inverse fertilityeducation relation is more likely to be
found in urban than in rural areas. It
may be because the urban environment
intensifies the fertility-depressing effect
of education through one or more of the
channels posited in Cochrane’s model.
Or, it may simply be because cities have

higher proportions of educated inhabitsants than smaller localities. Utilizing
‘data on individuals from the 1970 census
Sof Mexico, the present study seeks to
Oshed some light on this issue by comparAing the effect of female literacy and education on marital fertility in rural, semiCurban, smal) urban, and large urban
cocommunities. The very large number of
cases in the data set permit a detailed de‘gscription of the relevant empirical relationships for the second most populous
"Socountry in Latin America and the most
2 populous Spanish-speaking country in
7 the world.

The data come from a one-in-ahundred sample of the 1970 General
SCensus of the Population of Mexico.
ARestricting the sample to native-born
women in legal or consensual union
aged 15 to 49 who have completed their
education yields 65,355 cases.

VARIABLES

Fertility—The dependent variable is
operationalized as the average number
of children ever born (CEB) per married women. These data suffer from a
number of limitations. Among the major ones are underreporting due to
memory bias (Shryock, et al., 1976; Ed
Female Education and Marital Fertility 299

monston and Saposnikow, 1976), and
omission of some children, such as those
who died soon after birth and older children who have left home, because of
failure to understand the fertility question (Coale, 1971). For the most part,
however, these kinds of limitations are
more serious when attempting to determine the level of fertility than fertility
differentials (Bogue, 1971, p. 114).
Since the same women who have larger
families, namely rural women with less
education, are also more likely to underreport their children, the bias in the
present instance is probably toward understating the true magnitude of the observed fertility differentials.

Literacy and Education.—Apparently only those individuals who both
read and write were classified as literate
(Direcci6n General de Estadistica, 1972,
p. LXX). Level of education is divided
into no education, one to three years
primary, four to five years primary, six
years or complete primary, secondary,
and preparatory/university. Primary
school is so categorized in order to test if
a little education has a positive effect on
fertility; the last category is a combined
one because of the close association between preparatory and university training in Mexico and because of the very
small number of university cases in communities of fewer than 100,000 residents. The classifications secondary and
preparatory/university include those
who completed some but not all the
years of schooling at that level of education.

The sample is restricted to married
women who are recorded on the census
tape as not currently enrolled in school,
that is, to those who have, at least temporarily, “completed” their schooling.
The primary reason for this restriction is
because there are irreconcilable coding

errors for some married women (approximately 2.2 per cent of all married
women aged 15 to 49) marked as currently attending school. Confining the
sample in this manner also simplifies the
interpretation of the effect of education
on fertility.

Residence.—Four sizes of communities are distinguished: rural settlements
of fewer than 2,500 inhabitants, semiurban localities of from 2,500 to 19.999
inhabitants, small urban places of from
20,000 to 99,999 inhabitants, and large
urban centers of 100,000 or more inhabitants. These categories reasonably divide the urbanization continuum and
are similar to those used in previous
studies (Miro and Mertens, 1968; Secretarfa de Programacién y Presupuesto,
1979),

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The bulk of the analysis consists of
comparing the average number of CEB
per married woman for various categories of literacy and education while simultaneously controlling for age and
size of community. Since this CEB statistic is expressed in units of the data
themselves, its meaning is relatively unambiguous, it is directly comparable
across subgroups, and it requires a minimal number of assumptions. Additionally, an analysis of covariance is performed in order to test for the
interaction between education and residence on cumulative marital fertility.

RESULTS
LITERACY

Attention is first directed to the distribution of married women by literacy
status and residence (Table 1). These
data show a strong, positive relationship

Holian

between proportion literate and size of
community; it is 54.8 per cent in rural areas and increases steadily to 84.9 per
cent in large urban areas.

The results for the average number of
CEB per married woman are initially
presented in terms of the observed fertility means (Unadjusted panel) which,
however, do not take account of age differences among the literacy-residence
subgroups. Accordingly, these CEB
data are directly standardized on the age
structure of the population within each
residence (Std. Residence panel) as well
as directly standardized on the age structure of the total population (Std. Total
panel). Comparison of the standardized
literate-illiterate CEB means within
each type of community—the single,
overall-F-ratio derived from the Standardized Total analysis not being statistically significant (p = 0.236)—shows
that literate married women have
slightly more children than illiterate
married women in rural areas. Thereafter, though, literate wives have fewer
children than their illiterate counterparts with the difference seemingly widening with each increase in size of community. At first examination, then, it
appears that the effect of literacy on cumulative marital fertility is conditioned
by the degree of urbanization.

EDUCATION

As indicated by the results in Table 2,
married women in Mexico generally
possess low levels of education but the
situation is worse the smaller the community. To illustrate, 58.5 per cent of
the wives in large urban areas have
fewer than six years of primary school;
the corresponding proportions are 67.0
per cent in small urban areas, 81.7 per
cent in semiurban areas and 94.5 per
cent in rural areas.

interest, though, is the similarity of the

with complete primary, secondary, and
preparatory/university educations.

It should be emphasized that in all
four residential settings the first large
fertility decline does not occur until the
completion of the six-year primary cycle. Compared to wives with no education (Std. Total panel), wives with completed primary school have 0.65 fewer
CEB in rural areas, 0.75 fewer CEB in
Semi-urban areas, 0.69 fewer CEB in
small urban areas and 0.97 fewer CEB
in large urban areas. While fertility declines of a comparable magnitude typically occur at secondary and

preparatory/university levels, the number of married women involved becomes proportionately much smaller,
especially in nonurban localities.

Analysis of Covariance

The findings presented so far suggest
that there is not likely to be a substantial
interaction between level of education
and size of community on cumulative
marital fertility. But, because this issue
is of interest, the results of the analysis
of covariance are presented in Table 3.

small urban areas. Further inspection of
the results shows that the main effect of
education on marital fertility is relatively small.* This is because there are
large within-group variances compared
to small differences in the means for the
no education, one to three years primary, and four to five years primary categories, the same categories that comprise the large majority of women in any
size community.

SUMMARY

Based on an analysis of a very large
sample of married women aged 15 to 49
from the 1970 census of Mexico, the following empirical findings stand out.

*When main effects are processed before the
covariate and interaction terms, the sum of
squares attributed to residence increases to 365.3
and the sum of squares attributed to education increases greatly to 23,251.3; the corresponding
value for the age covariate remains practically the
same and the explained, residual, and total sum of
squares are identical.

There is an inverse relation between the
average number of CEB per married
women and size of community. Literate
wives have slightly more children than
illiterate wives in rural areas, but in
more urbanized regions this differential
reverses and seems to widen with each
increase in size of community. The
shape of the female education—maritalfertility relation is generally similar in all
four residential settings. That is, fertility
is slightly higher at one to three years of
primary school than at no education, it
declines slightly at four to five years primary, and then declines substantially at
complete primary, secondary, and
preparatory/university levels. An analysis of covariance reveals a statistically
significant but small interaction between
education and residence on cumulative
marital fertility.

DISCUSSION

A little education, one to three years
of primary school, appears to exert a

 
 

Vol. 31, No. 34

small positive effect on fertility, particularly in rural habitats. This may operate
through the mechanism of the biological
supply of children (Cochrane, 1979).
That is, women with a few years of
schooling may be healthier and more fecund than women with no education and
consequently bear more children.
Of the other issues raised by the findings we can next ask what might account
for the similarity of the female
=education-marital-fertility relation in
‘different size localities of Mexico. Unfortunately, the census data do not conotain information on age at marriage,
breastfeeding, contraceptive usage, or
scother variables that could help explain
Sthe observed regularities. The closest
ccexplanatory variable that can be derived
sfrom the available data is the proportion

lative marital fertility by completed education and is likely an important cause of
it. As such, this finding lends empirical
support to the path in Cochrane’s (1979)
theoretical mode] which sees education
as limiting the supply of children by raising age at marriage and hence reducing
exposure to pregnancy.

How might the discrepancy between
the results for literacy and education be
reconciled? An additional crosstabulation of the data reveals that married women with fertility-depressing educational characteristics (complete
primary or more) constitute 49.0 per
cent of the literate category in large urban areas, 41.2 per cent of the literate
category in small urban areas, 26.1 per
cent of the literate category in semiurban areas, and only 9.9 per cent of the
literate category in rural areas. Thus,
the more rural the community the less
likely a literate-illiterate fertility differential is to be found because, in addition
to the positive fertility effect of a little
education, a smaller proportion of the
literate group possesses the minimum
amount of education needed to reduce
fertility. In this light, it appears that the
key factor its not the degree of urbanization or per cent literate but the proportion of married women with fertilitydepressing education.

The results may also provide an insight into why aggregate studies have
been less successful than individuallevel studies in discovering an inverse
education-fertility relation in Latin
America. Cochrane (1979, p. 28) notes
that if the relationship between a given
variable and fertility is nonlinear at the
individual level, then the aggregate relationship will depend not only on the nature of the relationship but also on the
distribution of persons along the variable. As the findings for Mexico show,

the female education-marital fertility relation is apparently nonlinear at the individual level and different size localities
vary greatly in the proportion of married
women at various stages of completed
education. Whether a negative effect of
education on fertility at the aggregate
level is observed or not, then, will depend heavily on the educational composition of the macro units under investigation.

In conclusion, the overall greater impact of female education on cumulative
marital fertility in urban as compared to
semi-urban as compared to rural communities of Mexico is primarily due to
the proportion of married women with
fertility depressing educational backgrounds rather than to a markedly different effect of education, per se, on fertility. Thus, the results support neither

old” at which education begins to have a
fertility reducing impact. The results do
emphasize the country-wide importance
of completion of the entire six year primary cycle — important because it is associated with the first substantial drop in
fertility and because it accounts for the

whom education makes a-difference in
the number of children they bear.
