ABSTRACT: There is reason to believe that in the short run marriages are becoming more
stable in some Western African countries such as Cameroon. One of the crucial questions
facing these countries is whether fertility rates can be expected to increase or decrease due in
part to the increased stability of marriages. Analyzing 1978 Cameroon World Fertility
Survey data and using a multivariate regression model which compares the fertility rate of
women who have had at least one marital disruption with that of continuously married
women, we studied the relationship between marital instability and fertility. The results show
that fertility rates for women married more than once are significantly lower than those for
continuously married women even before the end of their first marriage. Furthermore,
marital disruption significantly reduces fertility rates after the dissolution of the first
marriage. Finally, even after the length of reproductive time lost is controlled, there is an
inverse relationship between the number of marriages and fertility. The results are discussed

in the context of economic development, modernization, and urbanization.

There is reason to believe that in the
short run marriages are becoming more
stable in some West African countries
such as Cameroon, although we recognize that it is far from clear that in the
long run modernization and increased
urbanization will lead to further stability. We feel that at least in the short run
modernization and increased urbanization will lead to an increased stability of
marriage in Cameroon because of the
following reasons. As economic development, which accompanies urbanization and modernization, goes forward,
the structure of sociodemographic factors such as infertility, early marriage,
large age differences between spouses,
high incidence of widowhood, and polygyny are changing in such a way as to
encourage increased marital stability.
For example, the leading cause of mari
tal dissolution in Cameroon is probably
the death of a husband. The large difference in age at marriage between men
and women resulting from polygyny in
combination with high (male) mortality
increases the probability of widowhood.
Polygyny also provides an efficient remarriage net for widows and divorcees
(see Lesthaeghe et al., 1986). Modernization and increased urbanization reduce the incidence of polygyny and the mortality rate. The reduction of polygyny, in turn, narrows the spouse age at
marriage differential. The reduction in
the age differences, in combination with
the decline in the (male) mortality rate,
negatively affects the probability of widowhood and so reduces the likelihood of
marital dissolution. Furthermore, the
declining prevalence of polygyny makes
it more difficult for widows and divor

cees to remarry and contributes to the
reduced likelihood of multiple marrlages.

One of the crucial questions facing
West African countries is whether fertility rates can be expected to increase or
decrease due in part to the increased stability of marriages. The literature focusing on the relationship between marital
instability and fertility is mixed in that
some studies show a fertility-depressing
effect of marital instability while others
show a positive effect. At the core of the
complexity are the two counteracting
forces identified by Downing and
Yaukey (1979): the negative impact on
fertility of the reproductive time lost
while a woman is in between unions,
and the pronatalist effect of establishing
a new union.

In general, research on U.S. samples
of women shows that marital instability
reduces fertility, especially for women
who do not remarry (c.f. Lauriat, 1969;
Cohen and Sweet, 1974; and Thornton,
1978). For women who remarry, the impact on fertility is most influenced by the
time spent between unions and the psychological desire to “cement” new marriages by having children. Lauriat
(1969) found that holding age and ageat-first-marriage constant, women in
discontinuous marriages have only 79
per cent of the children they would have
had if they (hypothetically) had remained continuously married. Increasing the number of controls by including
education, type of residence, whether or
not the women was premaritally pregnant, religion, and race, as well as current age and age at first marriage, Cohen and Sweet (1974) generated the
same basic finding. However, when total months in a married state—excluding periods of time between separation
and remarriage—was added to their list

Social Biology

of controls, the fertility difference was
minimized. Thornton’s (1978) results
once again supported the general reduction in fertility finding. However, the
pattern of fertility after remarriage
showed marked differences by race.

Studies of women in developing
countries have yielded conflicting findings. Utilizing two different data sets,
Swee-Hock (1967) and Palmore and
Mazurki (1969) found that for Malaysia,
divorce without remarriage and divorce
followed by remarriage reduced levels
of fertility below those of continuously
married women. Controlling for age,
age at marriage, place of current residence, race, and education, Palmore
and Mazurki determined that the effect
of being divorced and remarried lowered completed fertility 0.5 births when
compared to the fertility of continuously
married women. Conversely, Ram and
Ebanks (1973), Chen et al. (1974),
Ebanks et al. (1974) and Downing and
Yaukey (1979) found that marital instability increased fertility in Barbados,
Guayquil, Ecuador, and five Latin
American cities, respectively, although
in two of these studies the results of the
net effect of marital instability on fertility were not reported. For example,
Chen et al. (1974) standardized children
ever born by years of reproductive time
Jost and determined that people with
two unions had fertility 14 per cent
higher than people with one union. A
third union increased fertility an additional 15 per cent over that of women in
a second union. However, the authors
did not present results looking at rates
without controlling for time lost, so that
conclusions about the net effect could
not be made.

Overall, it is not possible to make
general cross-cultural statements about

bility and fertility. The purpose of the
present paper is to analyze the relationship between marital instability and fertility in Cameroon utilizing the 1978
Cameroon World Fertility Survey data.
To the authors’ knowledge, no other
study has focused on the relationship between marital instability and fertility in
an African nation. Following a brief description of the data set, we discuss the
hypotheses, present our basic model,
and show regression results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present study is based on the
data obtained from the 1978 Cameroon

Fertility in Cameroon

295

World Fertility Survey (CWFS). Information on full pregnancy history, history of marital status, employment history, and other demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics for 8,219
Cameroonian women, aged 15 to 54, is
included in the data. The data set is described in more detail elsewhere (Lee et
al., 1986).

Table 1 presents descriptive information on major social and demographic
characteristics of the total sample of
women cross-classified by the number of
matriages. As can be seen, there is a
strong inverse relationship between the
number of marriages and education
(wives and husbands). Specifically, the

married and those married four or five
times. A general inverse relationship
also exists between number of times

reduction in mean age at first marriage
is 2.8 years between the once married/
currently married women and those
married four or five times.

Mayor HyYPpotHeEsEs

Four major hypotheses concerning
the influence of marital instability on
fertility behavior are tested in this study:

Hypothesis 1: The fertility of women
with at least one disrupted marriage is
significantly lower than the fertility of
continuously married women, even before the dissolution of the first marriage.

Hypothesis 2: When the number of
marriages is controlled, the greater the
reproductive time lost, the lower the fertility level.

Hypothesis 3: When the length of the
reproductive time lost is controlled, the
greater the number of marriages, the
more the fertility rate is reduced after the
dissolution of the first marriage.

Hypothesis 4: The fertility rate of
women with disrupted marriages is significantly lower when compared to the fertility rate of the continuously married
women after the dissolution of the first
marriage.

Hypothesis 1 concerns the selection
effect of marital instability. There are
several reasons why women with marital
disruptions might show a lower fertility
rate than the continuously married
women even before the dissolution of
the first marriage.

Social Biology

Women with marital disruptions
might be a negatively selected group in
terms of fecundity. The lower fecundity
of women (particularly childlessness)
might have led to an increase in marital
disruption because these women may be
viewed as “‘less desirable” marriage
partners. Given the overall cultural
norm to have children, problems of subfecundity and infecundity are solved
through divorce. In other words, higher
fertility favors marital stability while unsatisfactory (low) fertility leads to higher
marital turnover resulting from successive attempts to turn around inadequate
childbearing.

However, there are other reasons
why women with marital disruptions
might have lower fertility even before
the dissolution of the first marriage.
First, the anticipation of unstable marriages might have resulted in lower fertility. Second, women with more children may be less attractive marriage
partners or may be more constrained in
the search for a second husband, thus
making remarriage selective of women
with lower fertility.

These latter two phenomena, which
together we call the “‘simultaneity effect,” are quite distinct from the former
phenomenon which we call the “pure
selectivity effect.” According to the
pure selectivity effect, the fact that
women with marital disruptions have
lower fertility rates even before the dissolution of the first marriage tells us that
the observed lower fertility rates for the
maritally disrupted women after the dissolution of first marriage exaggerate the
causal effect of marital dissolution on
fertility. On the other hand, according
to the simultaneity effect, the lower fertility rates of maritally disrupted women
before the dissolution of first marriage
do not imply that the lower fertility rates
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

observed for the disrupted women after

" the dissolution of first marriage exagger
ate the causal effect of marital disruption. This is because women who happened to have lower fertility rates by
coincidence or due to the anticipation of
a marriage breakdown would not necessarily maintain their lower fertility rates
after the beginning of their second marriage. The above discussion implies that
the testing of Hypothesis 1 for the selection effect 1s very important, though
caution in interpretation should be exercised because of the potential effect of
stmultaneity.

Hypothesis 2 has been tested in most
other research and not rejected in any
study. A serious shortcoming of these
previous works, however, is that they
did not decompose fertility measures
into the fertility level before the dissolution of first marriage and the change in
the level after the dissolution. Previous
Studies have simply investigated the relationship between the weighted reproductive time lost and the number of children ever born. A weight was assigned
to each five-year interval since first marriage based on the relative fertility rates
occurring during that interval in the
population to which the sample belongs
(see Downing and Yaukey, 1979; and
Chen et al., 1974). This approach can
lead to erroneous conclusions for two
reasons. First, fertility levels before the
dissolution of first marriage cannot be
influenced by lost reproductive time
which occurred later. Second, as discussed above, because of the selectivity
effect the entire differential in fertility
rates even after the dissolution of first
marriage between women who lost a
great deal of reproductive time and
those who lost little or none at all should
not be considered as the causal effect of
longer reproductive time lost.

Tests of Hypothesis 3 were performed in only three previous studies:
Ebanks et al. (1974), Chen et al. (1974),
and Downing and Yaukey (1979). As.
previously noted, all of these used data
from countries in Latin America. Each
study concluded that when the years of
reproductive time lost between unions is
controlled, mean live births per woman
increased as the number of marriages increased. It was shown that the pronatalist effect of establishing a new union is
strong in Latin American marriages.
However, there is another factor, the
negative effect of the number of marriages on fertility, which should be considered. This is the pure form of the disruptive effect of multiple marriages
when the length of reproductive time
lost is controlled. In other words, marital dissolution and remarriage have a
fertility dampening effect which is independent of other effects. In some African countries, such as Cameroon, a
third factor which is physiological in nature must also be considered. To the extent that the number of marriages indicates exposure to an increasing number
of sexual partners (both husbands and
other partners), and thus an increased
probability of exposure to sterilizing venereal diseases, fertility reduction is associated with a larger number of unions.

Hypothesis 4 pertains to the net effect of marital instability on fertility behavior. If Hypothesis 3 is not rejected,
then Hypothesis 4 will not be rejected.
However, if Hypothesis 3 is rejected, as
in the case for Latin American countries, then the outcome for Hypothesis 4
cannot be predicted a priori. In many
previous studies, particularly those for
Latin American countries, Hypothesis
4, which should have the most important bearing on the policy decision making, has been underemphasized. On the

other hand, studies on Malaysian data
by Swee-Hock (1967) and Palmore and
Mazurki (1969) report that Hypothesis 4
is not rejected although Hypothesis 3 is

not tested.

BASIC REGRESSION MODEL

A multivariate regression model,
which compares the fertility rate of
women with marital disruption with that
of continuously married women, was estimated to perform the tests of the above
four major hypotheses. A model similar
to the one used here has been successfully applied in the investigations of the
influence of rural-urban migration on
migrant’s fertility behavior in Korea,
Mexico, and Cameroon (see Farber and
Lee, 1984; Lee and Farber, 1984, 1985;
Lee and Pol, 1985; and Lee et al., 1986).

The model, which compares the fertility rate of women with marital disruption with that of continuously married
women, can be expressed as:

(1) Y;-Yin =

The dependent variable in the model
is the increase in fertility over the time .
interval in question, Y; — Y,-;, instead of
children ever born. Because the years of
observation are in five-year intervals,
Y; — Y,-7 is the additional fertility which
occurred during the previous five-year
period. It is not unreasonable to assume
that the increments to fertility levels,
Y, — Y,, are influenced more by current
circumstances, say, during the subsequent marriage (reflecting the causal effect of marital disruptions), and less affected by age at marriage or education
levels which are attained earlier in the
life-cycle (reflecting the selectivity effect).

The fertility data for ever-married
women for the years prior to the survey
year, 1978, were obtained from the individual woman’s lifetime fertility history.
In order to account for the entire period
of awoman’s lifetime fertility with a limited number of dummy variables, we

year intervals, 1978, 1973, 1968, 1963,
1958, 1953, and 1948, rather than consecutive years. Whenever the woman
had never married by the year of observation, t, this woman was omitted in the
regression for that year of observation.

Concerning our approach which
omits women not married by year ft, one
might suggest that we should use year f-1
rather than year ¢ as a threshold for
omitting a woman’s observation. Otherwise women married only a few months
are treated as if they have been at childbearing risk for the full five years. This
Criticism might be justified for societies
where premarital pregnancies are very
rare. In Western African societies,
where the practice of entering a consensual union as a first stage in marriage life
is widely accepted, our approach seems
to be justified. From Table 1, we note
that the mean age at first marriage for
Cameroonian women ranges from 14.5
to 18 years. Our approach implies that
as long as a woman was older than 10 to
13 years at year f-1, we treat her as if she
has been at risk for the full five years by
year t even though she has only been
married a few months.

The independent variables include
woman’s age at time f (A,), the square of
the age (A), woman’s years of education (S), the square of the education variable (S*), and the woman’s age at first
marriage (AGEFM).

DYR78, DYR73, DYR68, DYR63,
DYRS58, DYR53, and DYR48 are
dummy variables representing the calendar years of observation. For example, the value of DYR78 is 1 when the
year of observation is 1978; otherwise, it
is zero. The calendar year of observations dummy variables, DYR78,
DYR73..., capture the trends in

299

general fertility behavior over time. The
interaction terms between age variables
and the year of observation dummy variables reflect the differences in the influence of age variables over the different time periods.

DGAP,, DGAPi-5, DGAPs¢-10,
DGAP 1-15, DGAPi6-20, DGAP21-25,
DGAP%3 are dummy variables representing the years of reproductive time
lost between marriages by year ¢, not the
survey year 1978. For women who have
been married but are currently unmarried, the years of reproductive time lost
include the interval between the dissolution of the last marriage and the year f.
The value of DGAP, is 1 when the observation is for the woman who dissolved her marriage by the survey year
1978 though had not yet experienced
marital disruption by the year ft. Otherwise the value is zero. DGAP{-s,
DGAP¢-10, DGAP 11-15, DGAP¢_20,
DGAP?))_25, DGAP39 have the value of
1 when the observation is for the woman
who lost reproductive time of 1 to5, 6 to
10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, 21 to 25, and more
than 25 years by the year t, respectively.!
The years of reproductive time lost
dummy variables, DGAP’s, are expected to capture the causal effect of
marital disruptions on the fertility rate.

DNMR1, DNMR2, DNMR3, and
DNMR4are dummy variables reflecting
the number of marriages for the women
with marital disruption by the survey

'!Marital histories of women in the 1978 Cameroon World Fertility Survey include information on
the month and year of each marriage up to eight
marriages, current status of these marriages, and
the month and year of each dissolution of marriage. From this information we computed the cumulative years of the reproductive time lost up to
each year of observation, 1948, 1953, 1958, 1963,
1968, 1973, and 1978.

year, 1978, not by the year t. DNMR1 is
1 when the woman’s first marriage was
dissolved, but she has never remarried.
Otherwise, the value is zero. DNMR2
and DNMR3 have the value of 1 when
the woman married 2 and 3 times, respectively. DNMR4 has the value of 1
when the woman married either 4 or 5
times. The number of marriages (for
women with disruption) dummy variables, DNMR’s, are expected to reflect
the causal effect of the number of marriages on the fertility rate for women
with marital disruptions. The interaction terms between the years of
reproductive-time-lost dummy variables and the number of marriage
dummy variables capture the differences in the influence of the years of reproductive time lost on fertility rates
among the women with a different number of marriages.

The age at time ¢ variables control for
four factors, namely, the biological ability to reproduce, life cycle pattern of deliberate birth control, birth cohort effect, and the difference in age
distribution between women with marital disruption and continuously married
women. We assume that these factors
indicate that there is a nonlinear relationship for the age variable. The control for the age at time ¢ variables as the
difference in age distribution between
women with marital disruption and continuously married women is especially
important. The earlier periods of our
sample years are increasingly truncated
on current age, and age at marriage.
Given an age 54 cut off, in 1948 the oldest respondent included in the survey
would have to be younger than 25.
Therefore, the earlier periods have disproportionally fewer women with a
marital disruption because by age 25

Social Biology

very few women would have experienced a disruption.

This is why our model includes the interaction terms between the age at time t

' variables and the year of observation

dummy variables. They reflect the differences in the influence of age variables
over the different time periods. The
woman’s education variables and the
age at first marriage variable control for
the (negative) selectivity of women in
marital disruptions. Woman’s education
and age at first marriage are quite unlikely to be influenced by the disruption
of a woman’s marriage. In most developing countries adult education is not
prevalent. That is, education and age at
first marriage have the same effects in all
periods for women of all ages. Therefore, the inclusion of these variables
does not underestimate the causal effect
of marital disruption on fertility behavior.

Overall, our model is unique in two
respects. First, we use five-year fertility
rates throughout the woman’s lifetime
history rather than children-ever-born
data at the survey year as the measure of
fertility. Second, we compare the fiveyear fertility rates at different points ina
woman’s lifetime against the total reproductive time lost up to that point of time
for the same woman.

However, one might be critical of our
model. Suppose we are looking at a 34year-old woman who has ten years between various marriages. Given that we
are interested in fertility in the last five
years, how is this earlier lack of exposure relevant? If our interest is constrained to the investigation of the influence of the years of reproductive time
lost between marriages on the fertility
rate on the biological sense, the above
criticism is valid. However, our interest
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

is much broader. We are concerned with
investigating behavioral responses of
women with different numbers of marriages and different durations of marital

_ disruption in their married life. Does the

woman with the longer duration of marital disruption have a stronger desire to
cement her new marriage through childbearing? Does the woman with longer
marital disruption feel a greater disruptive effect on her fertility behavior? Has
the woman with the longer period of disruption experienced sexual activity with
more partners, and therefore is she
more likely to have sexually transmitted
diseases which might cause lower fertility? To answer the above questions, the
earlier lack of marital exposure should
be relevant to fertility in the last five
years.

RESULTS

Table 2 shows ordinary least squares
estimates of the coefficients for the interaction terms between the number-ofmarriages dummy variables and the
years-of-reproductive-time-lost dummy
variables. The regression results were
obtained using the continuously married
women as the comparison group.

The results in the first row of Table 2
reveal that the fertility rate of women
who married more than once is significantly lower than that of continuously
married women, even before the dissolution of their first marriage. This should
be due to the selectivity (infecundity)
and simultaneity effects of women of
multiple. marriages discussed earlier.
The finding indicates that we should not
reject Hypothesis 1. However, it is important to note that the fertility rate of
women whose first marriage was dissolved and who did not remarry by the

Fertility in Cameroon

301

survey year, 1978, is not significantly
lower than that of continuously married
women during the period before the dissolution of their first marriage. This implies that .infecundity and subfecundity
were not major contributors to divorce
at least for women whose first marriage
was dissolved and who did not remarry.
The difference in the fertility rates be-_
tween once-married (currently unmarried) and multiply-married women seen
in the table can be interpreted in two
ways. First, women with a small number
of children are more attractive for remarriage and therefore are more likely
to remarry than those with a larger number of children. Secondly, this finding
may indicate that once the first marriage
is dissolved, women with large numbers
of children are less likely to try successive attempts to turn around inadequate
childbearing because they are already
closer to their desired family size. However, we do not know which of these two
interpretations is predominant.
Interpreting the coefficients from
Row 1 of Table 2 requires some clarifying discussion. Initially, the fact that the
fertility level for once married but currently unmarried women is not lower

‘than that for continuously married

women implies that the main cause of
marital dissolution is not divorce but
widowhood. Therefore, both fecund
and infecund women are equally affected. However, the lower fertility of
multiply married women (as compared
with the once-married/currently-unmarried women) indicates that multiple marriages are more likely to occur
to women who are at least subfecund
and are trying to turn around inadequate childbearing.

Rows 2 through 5 in Table 2 show
that the coefficients for most interaction

years. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, the
comparison of these sums across different numbers of marriages clearly indicates that even though the length of the
reproductive time lost is controlled, the
greater the number of marriages, the
lower the fertility rate of women.” There
is no significant difference in fertility differentials among once-married, currently unmarried, and twice-married
women. Nevertheless, there is a substantial difference in fertility between
twice-married and more-than-twicemarried women. When the number of
marriages exceeds two, the frequency of
marriage reduces the fertility rate of
women with disrupted marriage even
though the length of reproductive time
lost does not increase. As shown in data
from Table 1, the mean years of marnage gap for women married more than
once in the sample had a range of 3 to
4.9 years. Table 2 shows that the following reductions in fertility occur for
women who lost zero to five years of reproductive time: two marriages, —0.28
children; three marriages, —0.48 children; and four and five marriages,
~—0.83 children. These reductions represent 8, 14, and 24 per cent of mean
number of children ever born to once
and continuously married women, 3.48
births in Table 1. There is no support for
the positive relationship between the
number of marriages and the completed
fertility levels found by Ram and
Ebanks (1973) and Downing and

2One might criticize our approach because in
Table 2 we look only at the interaction term between these two group dummy variables. It could
be suggested that we might need simultaneously
to consider the main effect of the number-ofmarriages dummy variable. This is, however, statistically impossible because the number-ofmarriages dummy variables and the interection
terms with the years-of-marriage-gap dummy
variables are perfectly collinear.

Yaukey (1979). The fact that we did not
reject Hypotheses 2 and 3 also means
that we should not reject Hypothesis 4.
Overall, even when selectivity and
simultaneity are controlled, the physiological and disruption effects of multiple
marriages reduce fertility more.

Insum, the results from Table 2 show
that fertility rates for women married
more than once are significantly lower
than those for continuously married
women even before the dissolution of
their first marriage. Furthermore, marital disruption significantly reduces the
fertility rate after the dissolution of the
first marriage. Lastly, even after length
of reproductive time lost is controlled,
there is an inverse relationship between
the number of marriages and fertility.

Before accepting the findings from
this analysis, attention should be focused on the issue of data quality. It is
well known that there are serious problems with using marriage and fertility
histories from many African fertility
surveys because of the gross misreporting of birth timing. One concern is the
possibility that there is a strong correlation between data unreliability and the
central variables of this study. Previous
research shows that unreliability in reporting childbearing histories (especially underreporting) is correlated with

The coefficient estimates—data not shown
in Table 2—for the education variables, S and S2
in Equation (1) were 0.038 (4.66) and —0.004
(—3.64), where the t values are in parenthesis.
The impact of education on fertility is positive
rather than negative and indicates a significant
nonlinear effect. One explanation for this relationship could be that increased education reduces the likelihood that a woman is infertile.
However, the positive effect is reduced as education reaches the highest levels, exposing the nonlinear relationship. The coefficient estimate for
the age at first marriage variable, AGEFM, was
—0.0006 (—0.33) which shows an insignificant
negative influence.

women’s age and education. High age
and low education are strongly correlated with multiple marriages as shown in
Table 1. Therefore, it is quite plausible
that unreliability accounts for the finding reported in Table 2 that unstable
marriages depress the fertility rates.
However, even if these data are less reliable than desired, the analysis results in
conservative effect estimates.

As discussed earlier in this paper,
multiple marriages (but not the dissolution of the first marriage) mainly result
from the subfecundity of women and the
successive attempts to turn around inadequate childbearing. It is very unlikely that women with multiple marriages, and who suffer from unsatisfactory fertility, would underreport fertility
levels even though their educations are
low and their ages are high. On the
other hand, higher fertility favors marital stability. Therefore, it is likely that
older, less-well-educated continuously
married women might underreport their
fertility. This fact implies that our fertility depressing effect of multiple marriages is underestimated.

' Furthermore, it is important to note
that any systematic effect on the misreporting of childbearing histories of education and ages should be partially captured by the age at time ¢ variables and
women’s years of education variables in
our regression model. Finally, Lesthaeghe et al. (1986) performed a very
careful evaluation of the reliability of
the current age and the age at first marriage data in the World Fertility Survey
data of six sub-Saharan African countries including Cameroon. They found
the tendency of the ages of women to
shift across the five-year age boundaries
according to marital status. Married
women younger than 15 tend to be recorded as 15 to 19 years old, and single

Social Biology

women older than 20 tend to be dropped
down into the same age group. Similarly, married women 15-19 may be
pushed into the 20-24 category when
age heaping is particularly prevalent
(rounding to 20). This practice can be
severely aggravated if literacy levels are
low and if the interviewer uses marital
status or parity to determine a woman’s
age. However, they point out that since
the degree of literacy among young
women in non-Muslim areas was greatly
improved in the 1960’s and 1970’s, the
quality of the age data collected after
1970 has been improved. They also indicate that the cross-sectional analyses
may prove to be more accurate than the
analysis of trends which relies heavily on
the changing behavior among different
birth cohorts. Our study should suffer
much less from the poor quality of data
than the notorious concern suggests.

DISCUSSION

The major findings from the regression analysis can be summarized as follows. Fertility rates for women married
more than once are significantly lower
than those for continuously married
women, even before the dissolution of
their first marriage. This is due to the selectivity and simultaneity effects of
women in multiple marriages. Marital
disruption significantly reduces fertility
after the dissolution of the first marriage. Even after length of reproductive
time lost is controlled, an increase in the
number of marriages reduces fertility
levels.

The results of this study coupled with
the ongoing effect of economic develop- |
ment indicate that delayed marriage and
the decreases of infertility, age difference between spouses, adult mortality,
and polygyny would reduce the instabil

ity of marriage, over the short run, and
in turn could increase rather than decrease the fertility rate in Cameroon.
Economic development, which also
brings increased education, urbanization, and increased job opportunities for
women, may not produce a short-run
significant fertility-depressing effect in
Cameroon as in the case of other less developed countries. This scenario is consistent with the findings of Bongaarts et
al. (1984) which predict the fertility increase rather than fertility decrease in
the short run due to the modernization
for some sub-Saharan African countries.

However, we hypothesize that, in the
long run, marital stability will provide
women with a greater level of confidence in a woman’s ability to determine her own family size, provide an in

centive to use contraceptives, and
eventually bring about a decline rather
than an increase in fertility. This is also
consistent with the assertion made by
Frank (1983) who argues that the reduction in infertility will decrease rather
than increase African fertility in the long
run. This assertion is based upon the
declaration that only when infertility is
low will women have the requisite confidence to limit fertility.
