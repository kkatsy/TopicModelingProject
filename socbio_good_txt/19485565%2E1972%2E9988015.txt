Genetics

Chromosomal Evolution in Man and
Chimpanzee. A Comparative Study of
Banding Patterns after Controlled Denaturation (in French), J. de Grouchy
et al. Ann, Génét., 15(1972):79-84.

The new banding techniques for studying mammalian chromosomes permit a detailed comparison between chromosomes of
man and chimpanzee. It appears that the
large human second chromosome may be a
fusion of two smaller chromosomes found
in the chimp. Four other human chromosomes differ from the chimpanzee by pericentric inversions, and two human chromosomes have small segments not found in
otherwise similar chromosomes of the
chimp.

Staining of Specific Regions of Human
Chromosomes, Particularly the Secondary Constriction of No. 9. M. Bobrow et al. Nature New Biology, 238
(1972) :122-124.

A modified Giemsa staining technique
is much more selective than that used to
give maximal banding and permits detection of one chromosomal segment even in
the condensed nucleus of sperms. These
peculiar bands are a small subset of regions
generally staining alike as “constitutive
heterochromatin,” which is therefore not
homogeneous in its composition. The technique stains larger portions of the gorilla
chromosomes.

 

ComMMENT: Jé is interesting that the segment staining most brightly by this technique is one of the two that de Grouchy
did not find in the chimpanzee chromosomes (preceding abstract).

Population Size and Protein Variation
in Man. J. Haigh and J. Maynard Smith.
Genet. Res., 19(1972):73-89,

If the differences in hemoglobin among
animal species have resulted mainly from
random neutral mutation, new neutral variants must be arising continually. Common
variants should constitute at least 5% of
human hemoglobins, but they do not. Only
rare variants occur, and they amount to
less than 1%. Calculations show that this
homogeneity of human hemoglobin is consistent with the neutral mutation theory
only if the effective population number of
the whole species was on the order of 10,000
for several hundred thousand years and up
to about 10,000 years ago.

CoMMENT: Another lump for the proponents of the neutral mutation theory!

Visual Acuity and Color Blindness
Among Brazilian Cayapo Indians. F,
M. Salzano. Human Hered., 22(1972):
72-79.

This study supports the evidence from
other populations that visual defects are
rare in people who obtain their food by
hunting and gathering. Only one of 120
males tested by the Ishihara plates showed

colorblindness [compared with 7% of European males]. More than half of 149
Indians had visual acuity better than 20/
20 and only one person was worse than
20/30. The one case of colorblindness
might represent admixture of European
blood.

Dose-rate and Mutation Frequency after
Irradiation of Mouse Spermatogonia.
M. F. Lyon et al. Nature New Biology,
238(1972) :101-104.

New data support the earlier evidence
that radiation is more effective, per unit, at
very low intensities than at moderately low
intensities. Over 200,000 progeny of male
mice irradiated at a rate of 0.001 r/min.
had a higher mutation rate per r than mice
irradiated at 0.009 r/min. If extrapolation
can be relied on, these results necessitate
upward revision of the estimated mutations
induced by natural and artificial background radiation.

Assortative Mating in Mice. I. Female
Mating Preference. J, Yanai and G. E.
McClearn. Behavior Genetics, 2(1972):
173-183.

In tests of 60 female mice of two inbred
strains, given a choice of males, 79% of
first matings in an estrus period were with
males of the other strain. Since males of
the same strain would be genetically identical with the sibship in which a mouse was
raised, the results suggest an instinctive
“incest taboo.” Such a tendency to avoid
inbreeding would seem to be useful in a
species that lives in small social groups.

Socio-ecological Implications of Individual Differences in Wolf Litters: A

within wolf litters appears to have a genetic
basis and implies the maintenance of behavioral variety or polymorphism by
natural selection. This would seem advantageous in fitting animals for different roles
in the social structure of the wolf pack.
Tests conducted with four litters of wolf
cubs revealed marked variation in dominance, prey-killing, and reaction to various
novel objects.

Psychiatric Illness in the Families of
Hyperactive Children. D. P. Cantwell.
Arch. Gen. Psychiat., 27(1972):414-417.

The parents of hyperactive children were
found to have increased prevalence of alcoholism, sociopathy, and hysteria, and many
of these parents gave childhood histories
suggesting the hyperactive “syndrome.”
The index cases were 50 boys selected “at
random” from 300 children diagnosed as
hyperactive. Of the subjects’ parents, 33
had one of the three listed psychiatric problems, while in parents of as many controls
only nine cases appeared. Familial transmission could be either environmental or
genetic.

CoMMENT: This study clearly does not
establish childhood hyperactivity as a
genetic entity. The identification of
psychopathology depended on subjective
assessments, and the connection between
childhood hyperactivity and subsequent
adult manifestations is quite tentative.

Twin Heritability Study of the Effect of
Corticosteroids on Intraocular Pressure. J, T. Schwartz et al. J. Med. Genet., 9(1972):137-143.

The glaucoma-like reaction of some individuals to cortisone eye drops does not
have a simple genetic basis and is therefore
not equivalent to glaucoma, if that is genetic. Concordance or intrapair correlation

with respect to the response was only a
little higher for MZ than for DZ twins, and
the responses did not confirm the trimodal
distribution reported by other investigators. Intra-ocular pressures were monitored
in a series of 37 MZ and 26 DZ healthy
twins who used the prescribed eye drops
for three weeks.

CoMMENT: This study exemplifies the
strongest application of twin research in
medical genetics: to test and in this case
to exclude a hypothesis of nearly complete
genetic determination of a condition. When
identical twins show very little similarity,
family data and population data cannot be
interpreted as evidence of strong inheritance.

The Social and Economic Impact of Hemophilia—A Survey of 70 Cases in
Vermont and New Hampshire. R. D.
Meyers et al. Am. J. Pub. Health, 62
(1972) :530-535.

Many physicians and many hemophiliac
patients lack what ought to be common
knowledge for the rational management of
this disease. Medical care of 70 patients
surveyed cost about $60,000 in the past
year, and this was only part of the burden.
Obvious improvements could be made in
the medical insurance plans for these patients. Paradoxically, better medical and
dental care would reduce the ultimate cost.

Ethical and Social Issues in Screening
for Genetic Disease. Marc Lappé (Director of program that produced this
report). New Eng. J. Med., 286(1972):
1129~1132.

Because genetic screening programs secure medical information of a personal and
potentially damaging nature, the development of optimal procedures is extremely
important. This article proposes a set of
principles to guide the planning and execution of screening programs. It stresses,
among other things, the importance of setting realizable objectives, of obtaining informed consent, and of permitting free
choice about parenthood.
