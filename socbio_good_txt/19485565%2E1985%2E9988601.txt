International Soundex Reunion Registry

Seeks Volunteer Geneticists

The International Soundex Reunion
Registry (ISRR) seeks geneticists concerned for the welfare of adoptees at
risk for unknown specific inherited disorders. They should be willing to contribute their knowledge by serving on a
volunteer basis with the Genetic Evaluation Guidance Committee.

The International Soundex Reunion
Registry is a nonprofit supportive system concerned with the needs of people
whose lives are touched by adoption.
An ISRR registrant may be any adult,
18 years of age or older, who desires a
reunion with next-of-kin by birth.
Trustees of ISRR are representative of
each sector of the adoptive triangle and
are adoption professionals. The services
of ISRR are voluntary, unpaid, and free
to the user.

ISRR is concerned with the problem
of the child whose “genetic blueprint” is
torn through relinquishment to adoption or foster or institutional care. Under existing sealed records statutes,
ISRR believes that the child is denied
knowledge of personal genetics and an
adequate concept of individual heredity
that should be part of the intellectual
and physical insurance of every human
being. Inherited disorders not apparent
at birth remain unknown until tragedy

strikes and the struggle for survival begins.

Within the United States, there are
approximately 5 million adult adoptees.
Their issue often span three generations. Within the next five to twelve
years, an estimated 2 million adoptees
now minors will reach the childbearing
age.

The ISRR receives an average of
4,000 registrations annually. Of these,
one out of every twenty adult adoptees
is handicapped to some degree with inherited disorders. One out of every
fifteen married adult adoptees indicate
inherited disorders for their children
and grandchildren. One out of every
twelve birth parents registers inherited
disorders. One out of every seven adoptive parents of minor children registers
because their child suffers a degenerative inherited disorder or has died as a
result of an inherited disorder.

Geneticists and other professionals
interested in volunteering their services
to ISSR should contact George R. Anthony, ISRR National Office, P.O. Box
2313, Carson City, Nevada 89702, Telephone (702) 882-0329, or Dr. Joseph H.
Davis, c/o PACER, 860 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, California 94301.
