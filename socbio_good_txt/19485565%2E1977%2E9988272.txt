ABSTRACT: Tay-Sachs disease is a recessively inherited, invariably lethal, degenerative neurological disorder caused by a lack of hexoaminidase-A. It is a hundred times more prevalent among
the American-born descendants of the East European Ashkenazim Jews than among any other
people in the world. The present retrospective study demonstrates that the currently observed
increased gene frequency among these formerly endogamous, highly fecund people is most
probably a result of genetic drift. Unique and drastic population contractive and expansion
phases are documented to deduce the formation of numerous founder populations which were
scattered throughout Eastern Europe by the nineteenth century. The subsequent mass familial
migrations to the United States, coupled with the cultural practices of the immigrant generation,
greatly enhanced the chances for heterozygote carriers to marry each other. Even if some form of
selection were operative in the past, the concatenation of unique cultural events provides
convincing evidence for the acceptance of drift as the primary cause for the differential gene

frequency.

Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an invariably fatal cerebral] storage disorder in
which Gyo-ganglioside Type 1 accumulates in the neuronal cytoplasm. It is
caused by a lack of beta-hexosaminidase A
in brain, liver, skin, kidney, leukocyte,
serum, and cultured skin fibroblasts
(Okada and O’Brien, 1969).

TSD is inherited as a simple autosomal
recessive with complete penetrance, and
the affected individual usually dies before
five years of age. Heterozygous carriers of
the TSD gene appear clinically normal
and are currently distinguished only by
reduced levels of beta-hexosaminidase A
(Okada and O’Brien, 1969).

The TSD gene frequency is ten times
higher and the birth incidence of affected
individuals is a hundred times greater
among the Ashkenazim Jews (Kozinn et
al., 1957; Myrianthopoulos, 1962; Aronson, 1964) whose ancestors originated in

Eastern Europe (Sachs, 1869; Aronson
and Volk, 1962; Myrianthopoulos, 1962;
Volk, 1964; Aronson, 1964; Meals, 1971;
Goodman, 1974).

THE PROBLEM

Why is the lethal TSD gene frequency
so high among the Ashkenazim? Myrianthopoulos and Aronson (1966) have argued
that the currently observed gene frequency
represents a balanced polymorphism that
was established and is maintained by heterozygous advantage. Other workers suggest a transient polymorphism (Workman,
1964) which probably represents the effects of genetic drift (McKusick, 1962;
Damon, 1969; Livingstone, 1969; Merrell, 1969; Chase and McKusick, 1972;
Fraikor, 1973).

Although lack of definitive data makes
it impossible to prove either position at
this time, an analysis of historical data

118

indicates that genetic drift was probably
the primary cause for the high TSD gene
frequency in the Ashkenazim. Drift simultaneously provides the most parsimonious
explanation for the high frequencies of
other recessive disorders (Meals, 1971)
such as Gaucher’s disease, Niemann-Pick
disease, familial dysautonomia, PTA
deficiency, spongy degeneration of the
nervous system, Bloom’s syndrome,
Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, essential
pentosuria, and dystonia musculorum deformans which are found in relatively
higher frequencies among various Jewish
populations.

WHY NOT SELECTION?

On the probably correct assumption
that the TSD gene frequency in most
non-Ashkenazim populations (g =
0.00132) represents the mutation-selection
balance level which was also the gene frequency among the Jews at the end of the
first century A.D. when the mass
migrations began, Myrianthopoulos and
Aronson (1966) calculated that a heterozygote advantage of about 4.6 per cent over
50 generations would elevate the gene frequency to its present level (¢ = 0.0126)
among the Ashkenazim.

However, the “very rough continuous
approximation model” (Myrianthopoulos
et al., 1970) used in the calculation is inappropriate to the TSD situation for at
least three reasons:

1. The model assumes large panmictic
populations with nonoverlapping generations and no recurring mutation, migration, drift, or any other factors that might
alter the gene frequency. As will be
shown, these assumptions are not met.

2. The selection coefficients are assumed
to remain essentially constant through a
1900-year time period in geographical
areas ranging from the Mediterranean Sea
to northwest Russia and through numer
Fraikor

ous sociocultural circumstances. This
constancy is unlikely.

3. If selection were indeed the principal
factor increasing the gene frequency
among the Ashkenazim, barring the possibility of different epistasis effects in different ethnic genomes, heterosis should
produce the same equilibrium level in any
population in which the mutation had occurred at all—namely, in all populations.
Since TSD is found in very low frequencies in all other nonisolate populations
studied (Aronson, 1964), this is obviously
not the situation.

Assuming that the TSD gene frequency
in the Ashkenazim is currently at its
equilibrium value, Myrianthopoulos and
Aronson (1966) calculated that a sustained
heterozygote advantage of only about 1.3
per cent would suffice to maintain the gene
at equilibrium despite its mass elimination
via the affected homozygotes.

Their attempt to verify heterosis by
comparing the fertility of unsuspecting
heterozygotes with comparison groups
matched by country of birth, age, number
of children, and current geographic distribution revealed no significant difference. However, they did demonstrate
that, on the whole, the TSD sibships
seemed to have better survival than comparison sibships and they concluded that
“It is not unreasonable to attribute differential survival to resistance to some adverse situations, e.g., disease, conferred
by the TSD gene” (p. 324).

This better survival might also be attributed to better health care received by the
family members with a TSD child. The
sibships included in their analysis were all
living in the United States in the twentieth
century. During the early 1900’s, Jewish
hospitals were already being established in
the Lower East Side (Hapgood, 1902).
Childhood deaths were recorded, and if a
child died, the family would be more likely
to take advantage of the available medical

services than would nonaffected families.
Therefore, many illnesses would be
treated before the sick person became
incurable. A study by MacMahon and
Koller (1957) indicated that an “appreciably higher” percentage of Jewish persons
than Protestants or Catholics in New York
City obtain physician care during a year.

In a subsequent paper, Myrianthopoulos and Aronson (1972) attempted
to demonstrate that the Jews’ well-known
resistance to pulmonary tuberculosis
(TBC) was the specific advantage conferred by the TSD gene. They found “a
virtual absence of deaths due to TBC, a
disease quite prevalent in Northwest
Europe, especially during the nineteenth
and early twentieth century” (p. 562).
However, it is just as likely that the strict
kosher dietary regulations and Sabbath
cleanliness rules protected the Orthodox
from the diseases all around them (Kaplan, 1967, pp. 121-122). And, as Damon
(1969, p. 77) states: “Ashkenazim Jews are
relatively resistant to tuberculosis because
they have lived for centuries under
crowded conditions where only the resistant survived.”

Although Myrianthopoulos and Aronson (1972, p. 567) did find a small negative
correlation between TSD and TBC, they
stressed that this correlation was too small
to be significant and added:

. . . besides, the linear relationship may not
be meaningful since the TSD and TBC data
are based on indirect estimates and not on
actual prevalence figures for these diseases.

The data analyzed was from contemporary Jewish populations. However, as
stressed by Aronson (1964, p. 145):

the relatively high number of cases of TSD
presently observed in the urban Jewish
population of the United States cannot be
attributed to any contemporary factor but
must represent the genetic heritage of a few
generations past.

Myrianthopoulos et al. (1970, p. 609)
commented that “the presumed biological
advantage is no longer demonstrable in
young American-born families with TSD.

If there ever were any heterozygote
selective advantage operative in the past,
it might possibly have been due to increased fecundity resulting from an earlier
age at menarche. Relkin (1972) reported a
case of precocious puberty in a TSD child
which raises the intriguing possibility that
TSD heterozygotes might mature earlier.
Apparently this possibility has not been
investigated. However, even if earlier
menarche were a factor in former times, it
certainly is not relevant in twentiethcentury societies where effective family
planning is practiced.

ON DRIFT

The presence in the Ashkenazim of high
frequencies of other rare recessive genetic
conditions as well as TSD (Knudson and
Kaplan, 1962; Aronson, 1964; Damon,
1969; Meals, 1971) can convincingly be
explained by a type of genetic drift: the
concatenation of unique cultural events
that drastically altered the size, demographic age structure, and marriage patterns of the Ashkenazim people.

Today, genetic drift is recognized as a
generic term which represents all of the
cumulative effects of all the random processes that can affect gene frequencies
(Roberts, 1968). These processes include:
(1) random walk of gene frequencies in
small populations; i.e., the random variation that occurs in the sampling process of
passing gametes from one generation to
the next; (2) random variation in the
magnitude and direction of selective and
other systematic forces; (3) random unique
events which include such things as novel
favorable mutations, mass immigration,
unique selective incidents; (4) the founder
effect which results in a small number of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

120

founder individuals composing the ancestral stock of an extant group, as a result of
a small group of persons emigrating from a
larger group or of a unique contraction in
the population which might have been
caused by war, famine, disease, or any
sociopolitical event; (5) the lineal effect
(Neel, 1967; Arends et al., 1967) in which
the social structure of a population usually
insures that break-away groups contain
many related persons so that the group
members contain a smaller number of individual independent genomes than the
actual number of persons in the group, an
effect which is similar to the booster effect
of migrating families (Roberts, 1968); and
(6) sociocultural practices, such as those
that confer reproductive advantages to
persons of authority or head men and
those that result in the differential fertility
of abducted women (Chagnon et al.,
1970).

It is apparent that genetic drift is
currently being redefined and extended to
include all the human sociocultural forces
that are able to influence gene frequencies
in human populations (Cavalli-Sforza and
Bodmer, 1971).

METHOD

A retrospective study of historical genetics involves observing the current
phenomenon and attempting to discern
the most likely sequence of probable
causative events. In order to provide convincing evidence for a drift hypothesis,
Mryianthopoulos and Aronson (1966, p.
314) have stated that it is necessary to
demonstrate: (1) that the Jewish isolates of
Europe were composed of very small
marriageable populations without social
contact with neighboring communities; (2)
migration of small groups; (3) famine; and
(4) disease or war affecting all or a large
number of Jewish communities simultaneously.

A search of the historical literature
revealed all of these factors, both singly
and in various combinations.

HISTORY

The destruction of the second temple by
the Romans in 70 A.D. resulted in the
dispersal of the Jews to various parts of
the Roman Empire. Those who migrated
to Western Europe became known as
Franco-German Jews, and they established the first German Jewish community
on record in Cologne in 321 A.D. It was
not until the Middle Ages that Jewish
scholars used the term “Ashkenaz” to
denote German Jews. Throughout their
early history, the Ashkenazim were an extremely religious, cohesive, endogamous
group who were extremely selective in
choosing marriage partners according to
the Biblical, Talmudic, and rabbinical
precepts.

Jewish law is very explicit concerning
matriage.

Every man is bound to marry a wife in order
to get children, and he who fails of this duty
is as one who sheds blood, diminishes the
image of God, and causes The Divine Presence to depart from Israel. .. . Whoever has
no wife rests without blessing; such a one is
not called a Man. (Caro, 1565, Shulhan
Arukh, Ebhen ha-ezer, i. 1).

Marriages were commonly arranged by
the parents of young children with the aid
of a Shadchen (marriage broker) in accordance with Biblical teachings (Gen. 21 :
21—24:28) which were carefully explained to each family by the rabbi. Selection of a proper wife was deemed so important that the complex arayot (incest)
laws contained in the Pentateuch (Lev. 18)
were read in public only on Yom Kippur.

A meritorious marriage was between an
uncle and a niece. “It is a mitzvah (good
act) for a man to marry his sister’s
daughter or his brother’s daughter . . .”
(Shulhan Arukh). But marriage between

an aunt and nephew was restricted (Lev.
18:12), while marriage between cousins
was not uncommon. Figure 1 reveals at a
glance those female relatives who were
available to male ego in a lawful Jewish
marriage during the early periods of
Ashkenazim history.

By the eleventh century, prosperous
Jewish communities were scattered
throughout Germany and France (the
Holy Roman Empire). Although the total
world Jewish population was estimated at
about a quarter of a million persons

To further complicate the genetic situation, it appears that polygamy, especially
bigamy, was not an uncommon practice
(Falk, 1966). Even though there are no
Biblical laws prohibiting polygamy (in
fact, it was a very common practice
among the ancient Hebrews), Rabbi Gershom ben Judah (960-1028) is usually
credited with passing an ordinance proscribing polygamy, under penalty of herem
(excommunication), among the Western
Jews, i.e., those of northeast France and
Germany (Wurmbrand and Roth 1966, p.
122).

community numbered only about fifty persons with very few communities as large
as a thousand.

For the convenience of their economic operations, the Jews lived not only in the major
towns, but scattered in many hundreds of
places which today would not be considered
much more than villages. The communities
were consequently, on the whole, rather
small, for the most part probably not numbering one hundred souls and in very few
cases exceeding one thousand (Wurmbrand
and Roth, 1966, p. 143).

These estimates include children and
postreproductive adults as well as

122

reproducing adults. It is obvious that the
effective breeding size of these communities was extremely small. Even if
many Marriages were contracted between
different communities, the effective breeding size of the interbreeding communities
within a circumscribed geographical area
would still be small.

It seems very possible that the TSD
mutation either arose or was already
present in one of these Rhineland communities. If so, the combination of
polygamy, inbreeding, small effective
population size, and large numbers of
surviving progeny could result in a large
number of TSD heterozygotes in the population in future generations (Fraikor,
1973). Support for this possibility is provided by studies of the pedigrees of genetic
defects in other populations where large
numbers of affected descendants can be
traced through existing records to a single
founder (McKusick et al., 1964; Dean,
1965; Kelly et al, 1975). So long as inbreeding was high, some mutant alleles
would be eliminated by births of affected
homozygotes; but reproductive compensation would still enable the gene frequency to increase in an expanding population.

The intolerance accompanying the
Crusades which began in 1096 played
havoc with the Jewish population. In
1236, Jews became crown property in
Germany, and by 1322 all Jews were
banished from France while about 140
southern German communities which
were populated by about 100,000 persons
(Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966) were destroyed.

Many of the 30,000 Jews who escaped
extermination fled eastward to Poland and
Lithuania as “a disengaged fragment of
Central Europe” (Sanders, 1969, p. 16).
There was major immigration in the
twelfth century to the Kingdom of Poland
which at that time encompassed an area

from the Baltic to the Black Sea. From
1264 to the late 1300’s, Jews in the kingdom were protected from persecution
(Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 226).

The presence of Jews in Lithuania was
first recorded in 1321, and by the beginning of the fifteenth century there were
five established communities: Brest,
Grodno, Troky, Lutzk, and Vladimer.
Doubnow (1929, p. 169) writes, “The Jews
of Lithuania, unlike their western brethren, engaged not only in commerce and
industry, but in agriculture as well.” Jews
were expelled from Lithuania in 1495 but
allowed to return in 1501. As Jews settled
in many foreign lands, it was not
uncommon to restrict their movements
and then later to expel them for a time
only to allow them to return again. During
this period of geographical relocation, the
Jews were traveling in small groups. Some
returned to Western Europe, and others
settled in nonrestricted areas of Eastern
Europe.

The historical accounts are supported
by linguistic evidence. Herzog (Chase and
McKusick, 1972, p. 339) has suggested
that the East European Jews must have
originated from the German Jews who
were previously organized into isolated
bands living in the Rhineland. He further
states that the migration to the East
“probably took place in small bands which
had been seminomadic for many years
before reestablishing permanent settlements.”

It is an anthropological fact that
seminomadic bands do not usually experience rapid population expansion, and
Figure 2 clearly shows that the total
Jewish population experienced relatively
little growth during this period. However,
it is imperative to remember that this total
population was composed of numerous
small bands of persons which rarely numbered as many as fifty individuals.
Additionally, since ancient times, the

LIFE IN EASTERN EUROPE

By the sixteenth century, Jewish communities or individual Jews could be
found in almost every village and town
from the Vistula to the Dnieper. While the
former great communities in the West
were decimated and impoverished, Polish
communities such as Cracow, Lublin, and
Poznan became world-renowned centers

for Jewish scholarship (Keller 1966, p.
278). Indeed, this time period has been
labeled the “Golden Age” for Jews in
Poland and Lithuania (Doubnow, 1929).
Great centers of learning were established,
and the settled population experienced
phenomenal growth, both from their high
fecundity and the constant migration into
the region by Western European Jews
(Weinryb, 1972, p. 317).

It seems likely that the average inbreeding coefficient (Bernstein, 1930) decreased

124

during this time. The large expanding
population size would result in less
inbreeding, especially since migration
within the territory was possible, and the
establishment of large Jewish educational
centers in major cities enabled the resident
Talmudic students and scholars to meet a
greater number of marriageable women.
The genetic effect of this situation was to
increase the number of heterozygotes in
the total population without eliminating
the TSD allele by births of affected
homozygotes. The literacy level of the
entire Jewish population was also increased, which facilitated the development of more cosmopolitan social attitudes
(Keller, 1966; Weinryb 1972, p. 317).

The Golden Age lasted for less than one
hundred and fifty years. After reaching a
total population size of about half a million (Keller, 1966), the East European
Jewish population was subjected to a continuous series of pogroms, massacres,
wars, famine, and plague which ruined
Polish Jewry by the mid-eighteenth century (Doubnow 1929; Schwarz 1951;
Wurmbrand and Roth 1966; Keller 1966).

The Cossack Massacre of 1648 was a
massacre of the Jewish population “on a
scale that had no parallel in Europe, at
least since the Black Death massacres in
Germany, precisely 300 years before”
(Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 290). The
Cossacks roamed the countryside, forcing
many Jews to flee from the smaller towns
and villages to the fortified cities. As word
spread of these brutalities, a mass flight
began. “Wild with fear, vast numbers of
Jews rushed from town to town whenever
the approach of Cossack hordes was
reported. . . . In the resulting confusion
many women and men lost their children”
(emphasis mine; Keller, 1966, p. 305) who,
if they managed to survive, were raised by
compassionate coreligionists.

Many Jews survived the effects of the
Chmielnicki Upnsing by hiding or by

Fraikor

temporary conversion to Christianity and
later reversion to Judaism or by temporarily settling in border regions, e.g., Silesia.
As Weinryb (1972, p. 318) states:

A reasonable estimate would apparently be
that the total loss of life did not exceed forty
to fifty thousand people—despite the historian’s far higher exaggerated estimates.
Such a figure would be high enough,
representing a loss of 20-25 per cent of the
existing Jewish population of PolandLithuania on the eve of the Chmielnicki
Upnising.

The loss in the Ukraine was far greater.
Over 770 communities were all but annihilated, resulting in the loss of nine-tenths of
the population (Rabinowicz, 1965, p. 23).

Following on the heels of the Cossack
Massacre came the Muscovite attacks
which began in 1654. The Jews in Mohilev-on-the-Dnieper were slaughtered; in
Vilna, they fled from the city, and those
who did not were either killed or forcibly
expelled (Doubnow, 1929, p. 256). Meanwhile, on the northern border, Sweden
invaded Poland. The Jews were accused
of bribing the Swedes to leave them alone.
The Swedes allegedly complied with their
request, thereby causing the Poles to
accuse the Jews of aiding the enemy,
which resulted in the Poles slaughtering
the Jewish “traitors” (Wurmbrand and
Roth, 1966, p. 290).

Concurrent with the Muscovite massacres in the South and massacres precipitated by the Swedish War in the north was
the reappearance of the plague in 1655-58
which struck relentlessly in Cracow (and
its Jewish ghetto, Kasimerzh), Posen,
Lublin, and Kalish.

The Jewish communities “disappeared
completely in the Russian Ukraine. In the
Polish Ukraine, only one-tenth of the
former Jewish population remained”
(Doubnow, 1929, p. 256). “The result was
the ruin of Polish Jewry which was heavily
reduced in numbers and completely im

poverished” (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966,
p. 291).

All of these events caused the tide of
Jewish wanderers to reverse its flow—
back toward the west. Those Jews who
remained were subjected to another wave
of Cossack massacres in 1769. Jewish
families were forced into continued
mobility by the pogroms. They moved
from village to town to city and back to
towns and villages when the pogroms
temporarily stopped in any particular
area.

The partitionings of Poland (1792, 1793,
and 1795) brought the eastern provinces of
Poland and Lithuania into the Russian
Empire which was ruled by Catherine II.
The policy of the Russian government was
to exclude the Jewish masses from the interior of the Empire. Strict ordinances
limited them to territories in the western
and undeveloped southern governments.
This restriction was somewhat lifted by
Emperor Alexander J when he signed the
first of many statutes “Concerning the Organization of the Jews” in 1804. Among
other things, this particular statute
contained inducements in the form of
vacant land on the steppes of New Russia
to encourage Jewish farming. By 1810,
eight agricultural colonies were established in the Kherson province with a total
of six hundred families and by the 1860's,
about eight thousand Jews were farming
in Russia. Additional colonization came to
a halt when “by order of another ukase by
Alexander II, Jews were no longer allowed
to settle in agricultural colonies after 1866

because Southern Russia ‘no longer
needed artificial colonization’ ” (Dubnow,
1918, p. 197).

The establishment of Jewish agricultural settlements was the only provision of
the “liberal” 1804 statute that was really
carried out (Doubnow, 1929, p. 307). The
remainder of the Jewish population was
squeezed by a series of special ukases into

Tay-Sachs Disease

125

Pales—regions in which they were
compelled to live. The districts assigned to
them shrank steadily in the course of time,
and new ukases expelled them from the
villages and packed them more and more
into cities and towns. The major objective
of this compacting was to force assimilation into the Russian population. The
Russian leaders would not sanction Jewish
autonomy as was present in Poland and
Lithuania.

Of the many ukases passed, one of the
most abhorrent to the Jews was one passed
by Czar Nicholas I (who ruled from
1825 to 1855) which declared that Jews as
well as other Russian men were liable for
the 25 years of military service common at
that time. For the Jews, preparatory
training in the Russian language and history was to begin at 12 years of age, and
the quarter century of military service was
to begin at age 18 years (Keller, 1966, p.
429). Jewish boys of eight and nine years
of age were also conscripted into the military. Called “cantonists,” they were often
forcibly taken from their parents (Dubnow, 1918, p. 28).

For boys older than nine, there was the
additional complication of leaving their
wives. By 1834, marriages between tenyear-olds were very common and could be
found in every city. To spare their wives a
life of widowhood, many recruits divorced
them before entering the military (Dubnow, 1918, p. 28).

In addition, and intimately related to
the compulsory draft law, two ukases
passed in 1827 brought additional hardships on the Jews. The ukase of December
2 decreed the immediate transfer of Jews
still living in villages in the government of
Grodno into the towns and townlets. The
rationale for this particular expulsion was
first to conscript the sons and then to expel
the parents.

It was hoped that the end result would
be a severance of the close-knit family ties

that bound the Jews together. The second
relevant ukase banished all Jews from the
city of Kiev followed by Sevastopol,
Nicholayev, Courland, and Livonia. The
result was that between 1827 and 1830,
the “Jews moved around like cattle from
village to town, city to city, province to
province” (Dubnow, 1918, p. 30).

The Jewish situation in the Kingdom of
Poland also took a turn for the worse.
Between 1815 and 1830, Poland was an autonomous Russian province which allowed its Jewish population of about four
thousand persons to govern itself upon
payment of special “Jew taxes.” However,
the unsuccessful November Insurrection
of 1830, which broke out in Warsaw, to
regain complete freedom from Russia
resulted in Poland being placed under the
direct rule of a Russian viceroy and the
Jews being placed under increasingly restrictive Russian rule.

Czar Nicholas’ 1835 “statute concerning
the Jews” clearly established the boundaries of the Pale of Settlement and forced
the vast majority of Russian Empire Jews
to be confined within this rather small
area. Prior to the 1835 statute, the boundaries of the Jewish Pales kept changing
(Dubnow, 1918, pp. 39-40).

Ostensibly, some of the provisions were
designed to put an end to the helter-skelter
expulsions from the villages which had
economically ruined the Jewish population
during the years 1804-1830. In reality, it
stated exactly what types of increasing restrictions would be placed on Jews if they
continued to reject assimilation programs.
The government policy toward the
“Jewish problem” had never really been
clearly established, and this continuing
series of statutes and ukases, with their
confusing and often contradictory policy
reversals, was an attempt to stamp out
separatism. However, the tactic did not
work. The Jews were only a small minority, about 11 per cent (Wurmbrand and

Social Biology

Roth, 1966, p. 365), of the total Pale population and the majority of them continued
to practice religious endogamy and to resist passively all Russianization (i.e., assimilation) programs. This resistance was
an important element in their subsequent
expulsion from the Baltic provinces in
1843.

Apparently, rigid endogamy among religious Polish Jews is still continuing
today. Tsafrir and Halbrecht (1972) found
that “the highest rate of endopatric marriages (in Israel) were contracted among
people of Polish and Roumanian origin.”
Furthermore, they also found that the rate
of outbreeding in a community is inversely
proportional to the relative representation
of that community in the population.
Hence, being a persecuted minority group
in the larger Pale population probably
tended to further increase the withingroup solidarity of the Jews.

Additionally, the Jews were further
subdivided into numerous religious and
political factions (Trotsky, 1966; Dubnow,
1918; G. Aronson, 1966) which separated
the Hasidim from the non-Hasidim and
assimilationists. Hence, the number of
suitable marriage partners was rather
limited, and inbreeding within the
compatible groups which composed the
larger population of total Jews must have
been considerable. This was a cultural,
not necessarily a familial, inbreeding at
that point in history.

“In the life of the shtetl (Jewish section),
there was little mobility and most of the
individuals who married were born and
reared, literally, in homes next to each
other” (Waller and Hill, 1956, p. 142).
Furthermore, because of a series of restrictions placed upon the Jews by the
Russian government, a shtetl Jew, who
was often destitute, had to purchase an
expensive passport to travel more than 35
miles within the bounds of the Pale (Dubnow, 1918).

By the middle of the nineteenth century,
the Jews were being forced from all the
villages into the towns and cities within
the Pale of Settlement, which resulted in
the formation of larger-sized Jewish communities. In the towns, Jews usually
constituted 30 to 80 per cent of the population (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p.
365). As the people were herded into the
cities, they congregated with existing
residents whose religious and political beliefs were compatible, so that many marriage partners originated from different
towns and villages within the Pale. This
situation is exactly what Myrianthopoulos
and Aronson (1966, p. 314) found was true
of the great-grandparents and grandparents of the twentieth-century TSD children.

.The reforms of the 1860’s intensified the
division in Russian Jewry because the assimilationists and socialists, who tended to
be members of the intelligentsia, saw
Russianization as the only potential means
for obtaining equal civil and _ political
rights for the Jews. The vast majority of
village and town dwellers, on the other
hand, interpreted assimilation as a threat
to the continued existence of Judaism
itself. They passively resisted Russianization by totally ignoring all inducements
offered by the government (Dubnow,
1918). The continual harassment by the
Russian government coupled with the
cholera epidemic of 1868, Polish famine of
1869, and the isolated pogrom of 1871 in
Odessa resulted in about 40,000 Jews (Rischin, 1962), principally from the Polish
provinces neighboring the Baltic Sea area
(i.e., Kovno and Suwalik), leaving Russia
for the United States (Keller, 1966, p.
468).

Aronson (1964) and Myrianthopoulos
and Aronson (1972) found that a majority
(45 per cent) of the ancestors of the
twentieth-century TSD children  originated principally from the pre-World War

Tay-Sachs Disease

127

II Russian-Polish border areas, i.e., the
provinces of Grodno, Vilna, Kovno, and
Suwalik. Aronson (1964, pp. 140, 143)
also noted that a significant number of the
ancestors were from the Lithuanian cities
of Mariampol (total population in 1902
census: 5,533), Kovno, Lida, Grodno, and
Vilna. A glance at the map (Figure 3) will
reveal that these cities enclose an area of
only about eighty miles and represent the
cities that villagers and townspeople were
being forced into.

The mass emigration of Russian Jews to
the United States, via Western Europe
and England, began early in 1881, immediately following the assassination of
Alexander II, the great reformer, which
precipitated another wave of widespread
devastating pogroms against all Jews
throughout the Empire.

From a total estimated Russian Jewish
population of five million in the beginning
of 1881, only three million remained in the
Empire by the end of that year. The mass
exodus had begun, and a vast majority
of the poverty-stricken and destitute
(Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 365) Jews
eventually, over a period of several years,
emigrated to America.

It was in 1881 that British ophthalmologist Warren Tay first described the
characteristic disease picture of TSD.

WHY TSD APPEARED IN AMERICA

Prior to 1881, it is difficult to isolate
many cases of TSD from the existing medical literature (Volk, 1964); therefore, it
has been concluded (Aronson, 1964) that it
must have occurred very infrequently.
Indeed, Lasareff (1897, quoted in Aronson, 1964) suggested that it seemed as
though the disease waited until the carriers emigrated to America or England
before appearing.

It seems highly unlikely that the disease
did not appear before the Russian Jews

emigrated to America. “It seems likely
that . . . the frequency of the disease was
high in Eastern Europe, especially in
Poland” (Myrianthopoulos et al., 1970). In
light of the historical data, it seems most
probable that the disease Just was not recognized in East Europe. Prior to recent

 

times, infant deaths were an accepted fact
of life, and accurate records concerning
the cause of death, even if known, were
not kept for a majority of the world’s
populations. In Jewish communities,
deaths of infants and young children,
usually up to the age of thirteen or fourDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 2

teen, remained uncounted in olden times
and were not even entered in the registers
of the burial societies (Weinryb, 1972, p.
320).

According to Baron (1964), the Polish
Jewish population increased from four
hundred thousand in 1820 to six hundred
thousand in 1851 to about one million in
1880. Baron further estimates that the
average Jewish birth rate in the early to
mid-nineteenth century was about 40
births per 1,000 persons.

Tf the TSD rene --ere already present in
the Polish population of 1852 with a birth
incidence of 1:6,000 (Myrianthopoulos,
1962), using the estimated number of
births for that year (Fraikor, 1973), there
would have been only three or four children born with TSD in Poland that year.
Since at that time about one-third (approximately 200,000) of the Jews still lived in
villages (Schwarz, 1951; Baron, 1964) and
since infant deaths were not recorded, it is
highly unlikely that these cases would be
reported in the medical literature.
Additionally, for the most part, doctors
were located in cities; villagers, whe hada
higher birth rate, were usually treated by a
felisher, a semiskilled medical practioner
(Kaplan, 1967).

Even as late as 1898 when the total
Jewish population in all Russian cities was
about 623,000 (Baron, 1964; Landman,
1943), there would have been only some
three or four TSD births, assuming a city
birth rate of 35.31/1.000 VJlewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 10). A doctor may or may
not have recognized, much less recorded,
the cause of death.

In the United States, the situation was
completely different. Most of the earliest
East European Jewish immigrants, i.e.,
those prior to 1881, had been from the
provinces of Kovno and Suwalik. According to immigration data (Joseph, 1914),
between the years 1886 and 1898, 87.8 per
cent of aj] Russian Jews Janded in New

Tay-Sachs Disease

129

York City. Of these, about 33.8 per cent,
or 112,169, were children under 16 years
of age. These children represent the parents of the observed TSD children.

If the carrier frequency of TSD were
1:30, there would have been at least
3,738 carriers by 1900. All these carriers
were now concentrated in one small
section of Manhattan Borough—the
Lower East Side—which encompasses an
area of about 25 city blocks. The total
population of Manhattan Borough in 1900
was 1,850,093 (Delury, World Almanac,
1973) of which about 331,860 were
Russian Jews. They represented, therefore, about 18 per cent of the total population, and the endopatric endogamy effect mentioned earlier prevailed.

However, as in the Russian Empire, the
Russian Jews were not a homogeneous
minority. Rischin (1962) writes:

Practically all East European immigrants
arriving after 1870 initially found their way
to the Lower East Side (p. 79)... . Five major
varieties of Jews lived there. Clustered in
their separate Jewries, they were set side by
side in a pattern suggesting the cultural...
geography of the old world (p. 76).

And, as Wirth (1956, pp. 204, 224) emphasizes:

The social distances between Roumanian
Jews and Hungarian Jews, between Lithuanians and Poles, between Poles and
Russians, and between Russians and Galiclans are sometimes so great as to make corporate action within the Ghetto almost impossible,

The impoverished Russian Jews turned
to each other for both socioeconomic and
religious support in the Lower East Side
by establishing a new form of mutual aid
society called a landsmanshaft. Members
of a landsmanshaft were called landsmann, and their religious and political beliefs were so narrowly focused that most
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

130 Fraikor

landsmanshaften had less than twenty
founding members (Doroshkin, 1969).

Furthermore, as impoverished as they
were, “every immigrant considered it his
duty to save up money for boat fare
for relatives remaining in Russia”
(Osherovich, 1966, p. 441), and most
“Jewish workers managed to save enough
money to make at least a down payment
on a shifskarte, a steerage ticket to bring
their families into the country” (Rich,
1948, p. 401). “It is estimated that more
than 80 per cent of the over two million
immigrants from Eastern Europe between
the early 1880’s and 1915 were brought
over to America by relatives who had
arrived here earlier’ (Menes, 1948, p.
339). And once the families were in this
country, they became members of the
same landsmanshaft. “Not only do the
Landsleute belong to the same synagogue,
but as a rule, they engage in similar
vocations, become partners in business,
live in the same neighborhood, and intermarry within their own group” (Wirth,
1956, p. 148).

As in the Old Country, early marriages
were the rule among the immigrants.
“Parents usually arranged to give away a
son or daughter between the ages of 13
and 17” (Sherman, 1948, p. 261) and
“among the Orthodox, marriage is arranged by the parents . . .” (Hapgood,
1902, p. 88). Selection of marriage
partners was from the eligible persons
within the landsmanshaft.

The low intermarriage rate, even between
individuals of the diverse East European
Jewries, reflected their small-group solidarity. Before 1900, the equipose between the
sexes in each group and a clan-centered social life especially limited contacts (Rischin,
1962, p. 110).

Furthermore, immigrant families were
producing greater numbers of children

Social Biology

than native-born American Jews (James,
1907). As early as 1889, it was noted
(Goldberg, 1948, p. 27) that immigrants
averaged 5.6 children while the
American-born Jews averaged only 3.6.
Goldberg attributes this difference to the
fact that immigrant mothers married at
earlier ages. “Wives and mothers at 16, at
30, they are ‘old’ ” (Riis, 1902, p. 98).

Therefore, in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth century, first generation
immigrant Jewish women were marrying
at young ages, having large families, marrying landsmann who were at least distantly related, and producing babies with
Tay-Sachs disease.

Even among the non-Orthodox Russian
Jews, marriage between distant relatives
was probably quite common, even though
unknown to them. Those marriages which
were not between landsmann were
often of an undeterminable degree of
consanguinity because many immigrants
did not know who their relatives were.
Families were often separated during the
numerous expulsions from their homes
and the nineteenth-century conscription of
young Jewish males into the Russian army
(Dubnow, 1918; Keller, 1966). To further
complicate the situation, immigration
officials often changed the difficult-topronounce surnames of immigrants; and,
if they did not, teachers in the public
school system did. The new names assigned to the children were often adopted
by their parents, especially if the father
were a businessman (New York Tribune,
July 3, 1898, quoted in Schoener, 1967, p.
122). Hence, many immigrants did not
know many of their relatives.

SUMMARY

The carrier frequency for TSD was
probably already significant in Russia in
the nineteenth century because the origi

nal mutant carrier was probably already
present in the German population prior to
their forced migration to the East. The
combination of polygamy, inbreeding,
small effective population size, and large
numbers of progeny could have elevated
the frequency of the TSD allele in the descendants of those populations. The subsequent period of seminomadism resulted
in numerous individual carriers being
scattered in many parts of Eastern
Europe. Some carriers probably also
remained in Germany or Western Europe.

During the Golden Age of the sixteenth
century, the rapid population expansion
and freedom of migration within the territory of Poland greatly enhanced the
chances for carriers to marry noncarriers.
Such marriages would further increase the
number of carriers in the total population,
and selection against the gene would be
reduced because affected homozygotes
were not being produced in significant
numbers,

When confined within the boundaries of
the Pale of Settlement, the Jews expelled
from their villages were forced to live in
towns and cities where they banded
together in shtetl communities. Shtetl
membership was based on similar religious and political beliefs, and marriages
were arranged by parents from among
their neighbors. This compressing of the
living area for the Jewish population had
the effect of bringing formerly geographically scattered carriers into close physical
proximity. Hence, marriages were arranged between persons who recorded
birthplaces from all parts of Eastern
Europe. Most of the Jews were destitute
and unable to afford the services of a real
doctor, and infant deaths were still an
accepted fact of their harsh lives.
Additionally, the disease had not yet been
characterized.

Soon the mass migration to America

Tay-Sachs Disease

131

began. Because not everyone was able to
emigrate, arrival in New York City
resulted in the formation of groups even
smaller than the shtetl—the landsmanshaften. Landsmann helped finance the
emigration of their relatives still in Russia.
Since most of the pre-1881 East European
immigrants originated from Kovno and
Suwalik, those persons were in a better
economic position to secure passage for
their relatives, many of whom were also
carriers of the TSD gene because of the
lineal and booster effects. There were
subsequent waves of Russian Jewish
immigration after 1900, and the immigrants all swarmed to their landsmann for
initial aid.

The Russian Jews were now crowded in
a small section of Manhattan, the Lower
East Side, an even smaller geographical
area than the Pale of Settlement. Landsmann intermarried, infant deaths were no
longer acceptable, and the births of TSD
children were soon noted. Thus, it seemed
as though the disease waited until the carriers emigrated to America or England
before appearing.

The reason that a high frequency of
TSD has not been reported from the
mother-areas of the immigrants is probably due to the familial nature of Jewish
immigration (Joseph, 1914). As suggested
by Aronson (1964) as being “remotely conceivable,” most of the carriers did happen
to emigrate to either America or England.
The result is exactly what would be expected from the booster effect in immigrant families.

To further eliminate the chance that
numerous carriers would marry in the Old
Country, the tragic events of the world
wars must be considered. World War II
alone reduced the remaining Polish and
Lithuanian Jewish populations by more
than 85 to 95 per cent respectively (Finkelstein, 1960). Hence, any increase in the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

132

incidence of TSD would necessarily be observed in America and Israel.

IS THE TSD GENE INCREASING?

Shaw and Smith (1969) suggested that
the TSD gene might be increasing in frequency in the American population.
Myrianthopoulos et al. (1970) have
commented that “there is nothing to support the notion that heterozygotes have
greater fitness in North America, Britain
or Israel.”

It seems unlikely that the gene frequency will increase, but for reasons other
than a presumed relaxed selection for the
heterozygote. If the current trends toward
increasing intermarriage (Lestchinsky,
1948; Warach, 1970), decreasing consanguinity (Klein, 1967), and reduced family
size (Shapiro, 1970) continue among the
Ashkenazim, the TSD gene will become
diluted in the general population. Furthermore, a stable population, i.e., one in
which each marriage produces only two

Fraikor

children, will increase the probability of
extinction of the TSD gene. Also, there are
now genetic counseling clinics to which
marrying coreligionists may go to be tested
for heterozygosity. Therefore, modern
prophylactic medicine and amniocentesis
should help to prevent the birth of
TSD children, and the accompanying
heartbreak for parents, and could reduce
the frequency of the TSD gene in the
Ashkenazim population.
