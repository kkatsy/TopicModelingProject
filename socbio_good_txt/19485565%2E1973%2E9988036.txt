Fertility in Rural Chile

When the Chilean National Health Service expanded its network of rural posts in
1968, a prospective study was begun to
compare trends in natality and health in
communities where family planning would
be included among health services with
others where it would not. By replicating
the comparisons in a series of small,
matched, relatively isolated populations,
the effects of the family planning programs
might be measured, essentially freed from
the influence of other variables. The costs
of the programs were also to be measured
and related to any attributive benefits.

Before any changes were introduced, a
base-line survey was made with maps of
15 villages, censuses of their 3,982 households with over 20,000 members, and interviews with 3,528 resident women of reproductive age. This initial report describes the
demographic conditions and the family
planning attitudes and practices existing in
rural Chile before contraceptive education
and materials were offered in selected
localities.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
To achieve maximum representativeness
in the sample, suitable communities were

sought throughout the area starting several
hundred miles north of Santiago, beyond
which most rural people live in small oasis
settlements or around scattered mines, to
about a thousand miles south where rain
and cold impose their constraints. The 15
communities? eventually selected, however,
were all located in the country’s principal
agricultural zone between 150 and 600 miles
south of the capital. While farming of
various types was the primary economic
activity in most of the localities, lumbering predominated in two towns in the
Andean foothills and fishing in two others
on the coast.

The sample was chosen on the basis of
the following criteria: It was essential that
each site have approximately 1,000 to 2,500
people; that it match another, preferably
dependent upon the same base hospital, in
its demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; that it be relatively remote from
the nearest city and hospital while remaining accessible to the interviewing team;

and that it have a Health Service post with
a resident auxiliary and periodic visits by
a physician. Ideally, all of the population
theoretically dependent upon the post
would have been included, but those families
in the most inaccessible parts of the area
of attraction were necessarily excluded. Because of these factors in selection, the final
sample was not strictly representative of all
of rural Chile.

Every community was mapped to
localize the households and respondents
precisely. The map established the boundaries of the study area and facilitated covering every house, making supervisory checks,
and returning for subsequent interviews or
Clarification.

A de jure census was made of each household to identify its head and all members
by age, sex, education, occupation, marital
status, and relationship, Information on the
house and its facilities (e.g., water supply,
radio, sewage disposal) was also recorded.

The censuses and interviews were conducted by female students and graduates in
social work or related professions from the
regional branches of the University of
Chile in Talca and Temuco. All had had
interviewing experience but were further
trained in theory and practice for this particular investigation.

Of the 3,677 women of fertile age (15-44
inclusive) identified by the census, 96%
were interviewed.? All of the communities
were visited on at least three separate
occasions to accomplish this, but the high
success rate was principally attributable to
the respondents’ receptive cooperation.
Although this seemed characteristic of rural
Chileans, it may have been enhanced by
the survey’s focus on an area of special
concern to the families: their health prob

lems. The interviewing team was always
accompanied by the authors, one of whom
(Milanesi) completed some of the more
difficult interviews and spot-checked others
for reliability. Each census form and questionnaire was reviewed on completion, and
the necessary clarifications were made immediately whenever feasible. The interviewers were quite well paid, but only for
their satisfactorily completed questionnaires; they were persistent.

To facilitate comparisons, a number of
items developed and tested by investigators
at CELADE (the United Nations’ Latin
American Demographic Center) and the
University of Chile were utilized in the
questionnaire. Complete reproductive histories were recorded. An additional series of
questions was asked of women currently
pregnant or having had a delivery or abortion within the preceding five years. Information was obtained on medical service
utilization and on relevant socioeconomic
and personal data. After a pretest, the
open-ended questions were closed and precoding completed.

The first 1,817 interviews included a
question on the woman’s attitude toward
family planning education. This question
was then modified to elict reactions from the
other 1,711 respondents to the possibility
of having family planning programs in their
local health posts.

The field work was carried out between
February 19, 1969 and February 18, 1970.

DATA
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

The age and sex distribution of the 21,246
residents covered by the censuses is shown
in Figure 1 along with the same information
for all of Chile (CELADE, 1969). The
most notable contrast between the two
population profiles is the deficit of young
adults in the rural area and the corresponding preponderance of children and the old.

Consequently, the rural dependency ratio
was 30% greater than that of the country
as a whole. The proportional difference was
even greater for the aged than for the
children (Table 1). The pattern reflects the
limited opportunities in the rural sector
and the consequent emigration of young
people, especially girls, to the larger towns
and cities (Elizaga, 1969).

The distortion of the population pyramid
was also conditioned by the high fertility of
the women who remained and by some emigrant mothers leaving children behind with
their grandparents. As a result, the child/

woman ratio of 778 was roughly a quarter
above the national figure. The ratio may
have declined somewhat in the last few
years, judging by Figure 1 which shows
more children aged 5—10 than under 5. Although this could have resulted from underreporting of babies or overstating young
children’s ages, it is consistent with the recently increased contraceptive use in these
communities reported below.

According to recent data (United Nations’ Demographic Yearbook, 1969),
women marry later in Chile than in any
other American country, and this seemed
to hold true in the rural area as well (Table
2). Only 7.7% of those interviewed between
the ages of 15 and 19 were married and
0.6% were living in consensual union in
contrast to women of the same age in
Colombia, for example, among whom the
cohabitation rate was almost double
(11.2% married and 4.2% in consensual
union). Even in the age group 20-24,
Chilean women would be expected to have

a considerably lower natality than Colombians simply because nearly 20% fewer
of them were married. Adding to the effects
of late marriage, about 15% of the rural
women remained single throughout their
fertile years. AS a consequence of these
nuptial patterns, only 51.9% of all women
interviewed were currently married or in
consensual union.

Although the demographic impact of delayed marriage and spinsterhood could be
offset by illegitimate births, the proportion
of these, too, is estimated (United Nations’
Demographic Yearbook, 1970) to be lower
in Chile than in any other Latin American
country. The rank does not necessarily
imply a high degree of premarital chastity;
reproductive histories showed that 55.9%
of the first conceptions occurred among
single women. Nearly three quarters of
these girls subsequently married, however,
usually during the pregnancy, and an additional 8.5% established common-law marriages. The rest were still unmarried when
interviewed and constituted 13.2% of all
single women. (The national figure, for a
slightly older age distribution, was 15.5%
[Direccién de Estadistica, Chile, 1967]).
Single mothers were still relatively young
compared to married women, suggesting
that they would likely establish stable
unions also, or emigrate. Only 9.0% of

Plank and Milanesi

them had had a second or higher order
birth.

FERTILITY

Birth and general fertility rates were
estimated from reviews of the reproductive
histories, The 3,528 women interviewed at
ages 15 to 44 reported having 687 live births
in 1968, the last complete year before the
study began. Based on this figure, the
general fertility rate was 194.7, roughly
50% above the Chilean rate. Due to the
rural deficit of women of fertile age, however, the birth rate of 32.3 was only 7%
higher than the nation’s (Direccién de
Estadistica, Chile, 1967).

Countering the demographic, social, and
contraceptive restraints on natality was the
general practice of early weaning (Plank
and Milanesi, in press). This tended to
shorten birth intervals and thereby increase
fertility.

Correcting for the 149 missed interviews
(mostly young, single students) and assuming that undernumeration totaled 3% of
reported live births, that the population
size did not change between mid-1968 and
the time of the interviews, and that outmigration of mothers with births that year
was offset by in-migration of others, the
general fertility rate was approximately
192 and the birth rate about 33 in this
rural population in 1968 (Table 3).

FETAL DEATHS

In addition to their 687 live births, the
rural women reported the loss of 91 fetuses

in 1968. By the definition generally employed in Chile of 6 months menstrual age
as the dividing line (CELADE, 1968), 20
of these were stillbirths and 71 were abortions, 4 admittedly induced. Omitting the
abortions, so that only fetuses at risk were
included (Shapiro et al., 1971), the stillbirth rate was 28.2 per thousand pregnancies. This was nearly twice the rate observed by Shapiro and his coworkers (1971)
in New York City for fetuses of the same
age. The greater mortality was associated
with substantially lower levels of prenatal
attention. Almost 90% of the New York
women were already under medical supervision by their sixteenth week, whereas
nearly a third of these rural women had no
such care at any time. Part of the difference, of course, may have been due to
misclassifying early neonatal deaths as stillbirths in the study areas.

The spontaneous abortion rate, on the
other hand, was considerably below that
noted in New York, (86.6/1,000 pregnancies vs. 131.5/1,000), and even there losses
to women not presenting themselves for
professional care went unrecorded. While
biological explanations could be suggested,
the apparent difference may have resulted
entirely from defective recall. Milanesi,
Berquo, and Silva (1972), for example,
used home interviews to ascertain the
events of the preceding year, as here, and
then followed the respondents prospectively.
The latter method detected 85% more
spontaneous abortions, and probably at
least that much recognizable pregnancy
wastage went unreported in these rural communities.

It seems clear, therefore, that the retrospective method was inadequate for measuring early fetal deaths. It was the technique used in other studies of abortion in
Chile, however, and the findings are compared in Table 4. Examining data from the
year immediately preceding their interviews

in Santiago, Armijo and Monreal (1965a)
found that 186 pregnancies in every thousand (excluding induced abortions so that
the denominator contained only fetuses at
risk) reportedly ended in spontaneous abortion. Requena (1965a) published data, also
from Santiago, which yielded a rate of 146.
Most of their difference was evidently due
to Requena’s inquiry having extended back
a full ten years with consequent memory
loss and lower ages and parities; the rural
rate dropped nearly 30% when lifetime
reproductive histories were considered. Correcting Requena’s figure by this proportion
would yield a rate almost identical to
Armijo and Monreal’s.

The urban rates calculated were more
than double the rural one of 87 and would
still have been significantly higher (p<
0.001) even if induced abortions had been
included in the denominator. Since the interview method was the same, the discrepancy
apparently resulted from environmental
conditions or differences between the city
and country women. Although multiple
factors may have contributed, it is difficult
not to conclude that respondents in Santiago
frequently claimed that their criminal abortions were spontaneous.

The rural rate of 6 induced abortions per

1,000 pregnancies is likely an underestimate
too; but the combination of high fertility,
low reported spontaneous abortion rate, and
fairly extensive contraceptive practice (see
below) in the region indicates that the
abortion problem there was not nearly of
the magnitude reported for the rest of
Chile (Armijo and Monreal, 19655; Requena, 1965a,; Requena and Monreal, 1968;

two other rural areas (Schulz, 1968; Hall,

(CELADE, 1965) and Santiago (Requena,
19655) (Table 5).

The earlier authors found far fewer contraceptors and much less efficient methods
being used. Since then, oral contraceptives
and IUD’s have gained rapid and diffuse
acceptance. As Table 6 shows, these two

law wives included) were asked, so the
calculation that 11.7% of all women aged
20-24 were using pills or IUD’s represents
a minimum. The rate for the same age
group, regardless of marital status, in urban
Santiago was estimated at 11.2% only two
years before (Monreal and Armijo, 1968).

Of those using IUD’s and pills, 66.1%
said they were provided by the National
Health Service while the rest indicated other
health agencies, private physicians, or
pharmacists directly. Among those naming
the Service, fewer than a third used oral
contraceptives in contrast to almost 70% of
those cared for by private doctors. These
two groups also differed in that twice as
many private as Service patients had employed their method for two years or more.
Although part of the difference may have
resulted from a lower dropout rate for
private patients, the data are consistent
with the trend to incorporate contraceptive
care into Service activities during the past
several years. The integration has apparently been greatly facilitated by the inclusion of family planning rationale and
methods in Chilean medical curricula. Recently graduated physicians and midwives
assigned to the regional hospitals recognize
contraception as an integral component of
their health care responsibility.

FAMILY PLANNING ATTITUDES

The 1,711 women who were asked their
thoughts on including family planning
among their posts’ activities were 89.2% in
favor, 8.5% opposed, and 2.3% without
opinion. Those favoring the policy did so
principally on the basis of the economic
difficulties of feeding, clothing, and educating children in the straits in which they
saw themselves. Lesser numbers cited the
health needs of mothers, the dangers of induced abortion, or the rights of couples to
determine and spacing of their children.
One cited the population explosion.

Fertility in Rural Chile 157

Opposition originated almost entirely in
religious and health concerns, with moral
objections about twice as common as fears
of health hazards from contraceptive use.
Religious opposition among the 3,100
Catholics was less than half that of the 293
Evangelists and other Protestants (4.6% vs.
10.3%). Clearly, at least in this population,
Catholicism is not the obstacle it is stereotyped to be.

Among the 1,817 women who were asked
the alternative question of whether or not
education on how to prevent pregnancy
ought to be available to any married woman
wanting it, 81.7% were in favor, 16.9%
opposed, and 1.4% without opinion. While
married women were considerably more
favorable than single women (86.7% vs.
76.7%) on this question, those in consensual union were the least so (71.1%).
(Some in these latter 2 groups objected to
the question’s implicitly excluding them
from the privilege, arguing that married
women needed contraception less than the
unmarried), But even the common-law
wives were more receptive than the rural
men (54%) in Hall’s sample (Hall, 1971).
Although those with 9 or more years of education were more favorable than others, no
linear correlation with years of schooling
was noted. By age, the youngest and the
oldest were the least favorable and those 25
to 29 the most so, apparently reflecting the
woman’s perception of her own immediate
benefit. Eighty per cent of respondents
thought that schools should offer family
planning education, but there was no consensus on the appropriate age for this
education.

DISCUSSION

The moderate birth rate of these communities was determined by multiple factors
among which the population structure, affected by selective emigration of young
women, was one. A second was the complex
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

158 Plank and Milanesi

of socioeconomic forces leading to fertility
control motivation. Rural Chileans are
probably less bound by traditionalism than
are the citizens of most developing countries
and literacy rates are high; about 80% of
the respondents claimed that they could
read. Also, more than half of them thought
that the economic situation of the region
was worse than it used to be, and economic
duress was the most frequently cited reason
for favoring family planning.
Contraception was the third major influence on natality. Modern, effective contraceptives were available to the population
through their health services. While it is
obvious that these would have accomplished
little in the absence of motivation, they
facilitated achieving family-limiting objectives where these existed and prevented
such motivation from being channeled into
illegal abortions. Chile has a relatively large
number of physicians and _ universitytrained midwives and through its National
Health Service has sought for an equitable
access to their services. These professionals
consider fertility regulation as part of their
responsibilities. Even in the fairly remote
villages, the majority of mothers had been
delivered in hospitals and others had had
prenatal or infant care at their local posts.
Such contact with the health sector appears to have been directly responsible for
the use by a quarter of all couples of pills,
IUD’s, and surgical sterilization. Since
these most effective methods are medically
dependent, the frequently neglected factor
of health care should be recognized as a
key variable in studies of human fertility.

SUMMARY
Conditions are described in 15 rural
Chilean communities with 21,246 inhabitants at the beginning of a prospective controlled study of the effects of family plan

ning programs on natality and health. From
the census data and interviews with 3,528
women aged 15~44, the general fertility
rate in 1968 was estimated at about 192
while the birth rate was only 33, due to
the emigration of young women. Delayed
marriage was characteristic of those who
stayed. Even including common-law wives,
only about half of the women of reproductive age were married, and 15% were still
spinisters at ages 40-44. This pattern was
distinct from other parts of Latin America.
Illegitimacy was also below the regional
norms, although more than half of first conceptions occurred before marriage and one
single woman in 8 was a mother.

Nearly 90% of the respondents favored
having family planning included among the
activities of their local health posts, and a
third of all couples were already controlling
their fertility. The great majority (75%)
of these couples were employing the pill,
the IUD, or had been surgically sterilized.
Induced abortion was only a minor fraction
of its magnitude in urban Chile, and with
the increasing availability of modern contraceptives may never emerge as a problem.
The relatively high use rate of effective
contraception was attributed in large part
to the incorporation of family planning into
medical curricula and into the comprehensive maternal-infant programs of the Chilean
National Health Service.
