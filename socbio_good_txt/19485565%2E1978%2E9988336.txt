Nonrecursive Analysis of 1970 U.S. Rates

ABSTRACT: This study tests two theories accounting for observed relationships between U.S.
rates of childlessness and sociodemographic characteristics using data on Black and white women
aged 30-44 from the 1970 U.S. census. Traditional theory sees the observed correlations as
spuriously caused by involuntary sterility, while voluntaristic theory interprets the associations as
evidence of influences on the decisions of fecund couples to remain childless. We examine the two
positions by estimating and then comparing the aggregate causal structures of childless rates and
cumulative fertility rates of women with proven fecundity. The traditional approach expects little
if any relationship, while the voluntaristic approach predicts high similarity between the two
estimated structures. Results support the voluntaristic position and thus offer indirect substantia
tion of the voluntaristic theory of areal variation in childless rates.

Previous research on childlessness has
demonstrated significant relationships between childless rates and sociodemographic variables, including education, female labor force participation, population
density, marital status, age at marriage,
and migration (Grabill and Glick, 1959;
Cutright and Polonko, 1977). Some scholars have interpreted variables associated
with childlessness as factors influencing a
voluntary decision to bear a first child. For
example, Cutright and Polonko (1977)
interpret their findings in a cost-reward
framework derived from Scanzoni (1975,
Chap. 2). Other studies have also used
voluntaristic models in examining variation in rates of childlessness (Nason and
Paloma, 1974; Veevers, 1973; Gustavus
and Henley, 1971). These “voluntaristic”
theorists view relationships between rates
of childlessness and sociodemographic
variables as causal effects on decision processes underlying the 0-1 parity transition
probability.

The emphasis on voluntary choice represents a major change from traditional

demographic perspectives on childlessness. Early studies (Kiser, 1939; Lorimer
and Osborn, 1934) reported that about
three-fourths of childless couples said they
had never practiced any form of contraception and expressed disappointment
over their inability to bear children. From
these data the authors inferred that the
principal determinant of childlessness was
involuntary sterility, i.e., the inability to
bear a child. This interpretation was supported by later demographers. (Whelpton
et al., 1966, pp. 162-166; Farley, 1970,
Chap. 9) who also concluded that childlessness resulted largely from  physiological dysfunction.

Recent analysts (Griffith, 1973; Namboodiri, 1972; Blake, 1968) contend that
married couples are under strong normative pressure to bear at least two children.
Thus, few fecund couples remain childless
by choice. Sterility (as a function of age at
marriage and/or physiological disorder)
explains the relationships between childlessness and socioeconomic variables.
For example, Sweet (1973) noted that

169

170 Freshnock and Cutright

wives unable to bear children are more
likely to work, thereby increasing the positive association between female labor
force participation and childless rates,
while Veevers (1971a) and others have related age at marriage to fecundity and
childless rates. This perspective views
areal correlations between childless rates
and sociodemographic variables as spuriously caused by areal variation in involuntary sterility.

However, recent trends suggest that the
traditional view of childlessness as largely
involuntary may no longer be appropriate.
For example, between 1967 and 1975, the
proportion of white wives aged 18-24 saying they intend to remain childless increased from 1.3 to 4.4 per cent (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1977, Table 78).
Actual childlessness among younger women has also increased steadily over the
past decade (Heuser, 1976, Table 6A). Because health care and medical technology
have improved, recent increases in childless rates cannot be attributed to higher
rates of sterility.

Some analysts (Cutright and Polonko,
1977; Scanzoni, 1975; Griffith, 1973) have
suggested that the normative pressure on
young married couples to bear children is
decreasing. Also, egalitarianism in familial sex roles, believed to be an important
predictor of childlessness (Veevers, 1974),
is increasing (Scanzoni, 1975). Of course,
the recent increase in childlessness may
only reflect postponement of childbearing
among younger couples. However, some
evidence indicates that the decision to remain childless usually follows a sequence
of earlier decisions to postpone childbearing. Eventually, rewards from alternative
roles available to childless couples make
the costs of bearing a child prohibitive
(Scanzoni and Polonko, 1975; Veevers,
1973). Thus, voluntary childlessness early
in the life cycle may exert an independent
effect on later fertility by altering the rela

tive costs and rewards of subsequent
childbearing.

In sum, two opposing theories account
for the relationships between childless
rates and a number of sociodemographic variables. The traditional perspective
states that observed correlations are spuriously caused by covariation between involuntary sterility and sociodemographic
indicators. In opposition, the voluntaristic
position views observed relations as evidence that causal variables influence voluntary decisions to remain childless.

Whether using regression or simpler
statistical models, prior work did not adequately test these alternative explanations.
For example, Cutright and Polonko (1977)
estimated a recursive regression model of
childless rates of wives and interpreted
their results within a voluntaristic costreward framework. However, their study
is vulnerable to the traditional criticism
that associations interpreted as evidence of
voluntary choice are spuriously caused by
correlations between sterility and the
sociodemographic variables. For example,
sterility may influence female migration,
labor force participation, or other variables which then appear, in cross-section,
to be causes of childlessness. Thus, while
the cost-reward framework lends interpretive coherence to Cutright and Polonko’s
findings, nothing in their data allows a test
between the voluntaristic and traditional
explanations of variation in areal rates of
childlessness. We now discuss the logic of
an indirect test of these two opposing positions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

AN INDIRECT TEST

To the extent the couples are childless
by choice, Veevers (1971c, p. 547) hypothesized that “variations in the incidence of
childlessness will occur concomitantly,
and in the expected direction, with varia

tions in determinants know to affect fertility.” Thus, “voluntaristic” theory predicts
that childlessness is causally influenced by
sociodemographic variables that also affect measures of cumulative fertility of
fecund women; both influences occur
through voluntary choice. However, traditional theorists may respond by stating
that areal variation in involuntary sterility, by definition, should be negatively related to cumulative fertility while positively influencing childless rates. This is
expected because, all else equal, areas
with many childless women will also have
low rates of cumulative fertility among all
women.

To resolve this impasse, we estimate
and compare the effects of sociodemographic indicators on childless rates and the
cumulative fertility of women of proven
fecundity by examining rates only among
women who have borne at least one child.
To the extent that variation in voluntary
childlessness determines variation in the
childless rate, we hypothesize that the
causal structures of rates of childlessness
and the cumulative fertility of fecund
women should be similar and of opposite
sign. A comparative analysis of these two
fertility variables should reduce the criticism that causal similarity is spuriously
caused by involuntary sterility. However,
the test is not definitive in that only the
voluntaristic position may be disproved
directly. For certain variables, such as
labor force participation, causal similarity
could still reflect spurious influences of
sterility. We now discuss the rationale for
using aggregate data to test this hypothesis.

THE USE OF AGGREGATE DATA

Individual-level studies comparing the
fertility of childless women and mothers
are hard pressed (1) to match adequately
the two samples, (2) to include measures of

community health care and the availabil- .

171

ity of comparable birth control methods,
and (3) to measure the effect of female
labor force opportunity. Individual-level
studies usually do not estimate the effect of
female labor force opportunity on the fertility of women who are not employed because “among individual households the
wage rate of wives is either unknown (for
the approximately two-thirds of wives
who are not working) or is likely to be
highly endogenous” (Cain and Weininger,
1973, p. 208). This so-called “shadowprice” of a woman’s time, as estimated by
the actual female labor force rate, should
be important in studies of childlessness because the opportunity costs of a first child
may be greater than those of succeeding
births.

By using aggregate data, the effect of
the female labor force participation rate
includes the influence of the employment
opportunity structure on both the fertility
of women who are employed and those not
in the Jabor force. Thus, aggregate analysis allows an assessment of the impact on
fertility of areal differences in the female
opportunity structure. Further, grouped
data suppresses variation in individual
tastes for children and reduces effects of
measurement error in both endogenous
and exogenous variables. By using large
areas, we assume that measurement error
and child preferences are normally distributed and therefore have an expected
value of zero within each area (Cain and
Weininger, 1973). However, if variation
in tastes or measurement error is related to
the grouping procedure through selective
migration or inaccurate data collection,
this assumption is invalid. In sum, areal
data improves our ability to compare the
determinants of rates of childlessness with
those determinants of cumulative fertility
rates in the fecund population.

We caution that estimated parameters
cannot be interpreted as individual-level
effects (Hannan and Burstein, 1974).

172

Rather, our purpose is to determine which
of two theoretical positions, the traditional
or the voluntaristic, best describes the relationship between the aggregate causal
structures of childlessness and the cumulative fertility of fecund women. The voluntaristic position predicts high similarity,
while traditional theory foresees little if
any relationship.

DATA

Data are special tabulations from the
1970 census. Cutright and Jaffe (1977a, p.
10, for justification) created statistical
areal units (SAU’s) by aggregating
county-level data. For whites, one county
became one SAU if it had at least 20,000
white women aged 15-44; counties with
smaller white female populations were
combined with contiguous areas. The
3,067 counties with usable data for whites
were reduced to 778 SAU’s.

Because 1,577 counties have few or no
Black women aged 15-44, Cutright and
Jaffe created separate SAU’s for Blacks.
Single counties with at least 10,000 Black
women aged 15-44 became separate
SAU’s, while counties with smaller Black
female populations were merged. In this
way, data on Black women in 1,490 counties were reduced to 237 SAU’s.

DESIGN

A linear simultaneous-equation model is
used to estimate the effects of causal variables on rates of childlessness and children
ever born per mother (CEBM). The model
is nonrecursive because female labor
force participation may be reciprocally
influenced by fertility (Sweet, 1973).
Coefficients were estimated by the method
of two-stage least squares (see Johnston,
1972, for a discussion of identification and
estimation procedures). The basic regression model is fitted separately to data for
Black and white women because mean
childlessness and CEBM (Table 1) differ
by race and because causal variables may
interact with race.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES

The childless rate per 1,000 women
aged 30-44, by race, is one dependent
variable. Although this is a broad age
group, if the white birth cohort of 1926 is
taken as an example, the mean rate per
1,000 with a first birth for exact ages
31-45 is 894, or 98.5 per cent of the final
rate of 908 by exact age 45 (Heuser, 1976,
Table 6B).

The second dependent variable is the
number of children ever born per 1,000
mothers (CEBM) aged 30-44, by race.

The mean rate for children ever born to
the white birth cohort of 1926 for exact
ages 31—45 is 2,702, or 92.6 per cent of the
final rate of 2,917 by exact age 45 (Heuser,
1976, Table 6B).

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

After defining each independent variable, we include a rationale for expecting
the variable to affect childlessness. We
omit parallel explanations for expecting
the opposite effect on CEBM.

Population density is the natural logarithm of 1970 total population in the
counties that make up a SAU, divided by
square miles. Increases in density should
increase rates of childlessness (Grabill and
Glick, 1959; Veevers, 1971a,b) because
density is positively related to the cost of
bearing and raising children (Rainwater,
1973) and to the availability of alternative
roles for women that encourage childlessness. Across both white and Black SAU’s,
population density is positively related (r
= 0.64) to the percentage of women in
urban areas and fits rates of childlessness
slightly better than does the percentage of
women living in urban areas.

Southern residence is important because Southern whites are more likely
than whites outside the South to postpone
first births, whether before or after marriage (Freshnock and Cutright, unpublished, 1978a, Tables 3 and 4). This regional difference may affect rates of
childlessness for older white women. We
included region in analyses of Blacks to
test whether the traditionally low
childlessness and high cumulative fertility
of Southern Blacks (Farley, 1970, Chap.
4) persisted in 1970. This variable is coded
1 for SAU’s in the South and 0 for all
others.

Low education in an age-race subgroup
is measured by the number of women per
1,000 with less than eight completed years
of school. We expect low education to be

Determinants of Childlessness

173

negatively related to childlessness and
positively related to CEBM because
women with little education have fewer
alternatives to childbearing than do
women with more education (Grabill and
Glick, 1959) and less effective control over
fertility (Ryder, 1973).

Education is measured in this way because (1) a “common level of birth control
information may exist throughout the
middle and upper ranges of the educational strata. Thus, variation in percentages of the least educated group may explain more of the variation in fertility”
(Cain and Weininger, 1973, p. 210) and (2)
recent research (Rao, 1974, Table 3) indicates that by educational level, the per
cent of women childless differs only between those completing Grades 1-8 and
those with more than eight years of education.

Migration is the number of women per
1,000 in an age-race subgroup who in 1965
resided outside the county of residence in
1970. High rates of migration may be related to economic opportunities for unmarried women as well as for wives and
their husbands. Also, childless couples
and those with small families may be more
likely to migrate than other couples. Thus,
high rates of migration should be positively related to rates of childlessness.

Physician density in each SAU is measured by the number of primary-care doctors and chiropractors per 1,000 women
aged 15-44. Interns, residents, fellows,
and physicians primarily concerned with
teaching or research are omitted (Office of
Economic Opportunity, 1972, p. 298).
The measure is not race specific; it indicates availability of general medical care
to women of reproductive age. If the density of physicians increases access to
physician-controlled contraceptive or
other birth control services, then net of
other factors, the more physicians, the
more likely that women who want to re

174

main childless will be able to find the medical care necessary to achieve this goal.
Physician density should reduce CEBM.

Program enrollment is a proxy for community attitudes toward birth control and
responsiveness of the health care system to
women’s need for birth control. The
numerator is the 1969 count of patients
enrolled in organized family planning programs in the SAU; the denominator is the
estimated number of women in the SAU
whose family incomes were below 200 per
cent of the 1969 federal poverty line and
who were estimated to be at risk of unwanted pregnancy because they were sexually active, not sterile, not pregnant, and
did not want a pregnancy (Office of Economic Opportunity, 1972; Dryfoos, 1973).

Program enrollment differences among
SAU’s in 1969 reflect historical differences
in the delivery of family planning services
to upper- and lower-income women (Cutright and Jaffe, 1977b). In the 1960’s,*
communities with positive attitudes and
practices toward birth control were the
first to claim federal funds for family
planning programs and therefore had
more patients in 1969 than did communities with negative attitudes and practices. This variable does not measure the
effect of 1969 enrollment on fertility because the services are generally restricted
to lower-income women, our fertility rates
are not income specific, and most births to
women aged 30-44 occurred before the
U.S. program included a significant number of patients.

Marital status is measured by the num-.
ber of never-married women per 1,000
women in each age and race subgroup.
Among whites the number of nevermarried women should directly increase
childlessness because in the average SAU
only 12 per cent of older, white, nevermarried women have borne children; the
corresponding figure for Black women is
40 per cent (Freshnock and Cutright, un
Freshnock and Cutright

Social Biology

published, 19785, Table 1). Further,
wives aged 30-44 in areas with high proportions of never-married women should
be older at marriage than wives of comparable age in areas with few nevermarried women. In areas with later age at
marriage, older childless wives may experience higher costs of having a first child
and less disapproval of childlessness
(Poston, 1974; Veevers, 1971a,b; Mitra,
1966). Therefore, this variable should
influence fertility rates because (1) it is an
indicator of marital status and (2) it is also
a proxy for wives’ age at marriage.
Labor force participation per 1,000
women aged 30-44 by age and race is an
endogenous variable (Sweet, 1973). We
expect that childlessness will be higher
and CEBM will be lower in SAU’s with
high female labor force participation because such areas provide women with jobs
and, thus, offer alternatives to the role of
wife and mother. Such areas also tend to
be higher income areas; thus, they attract
more female workers (Cain, 1966, Table
3). Therefore, even after the effects of fertility on employment are controlled,
higher rates of labor force participation
should increase childlessness because opportunity costs of women who do not work
will be greater in SAU’s with high labor
force rates (Cain and Dooley, 1976).

RESULTS

Means and standard deviations for all
variables are presented in Table 1. Both
childless rates and CEBM are higher
among Black than white women. Black
SAU’s tend to be more densely populated
and more likely to be in the South than
white SAU’s. Low education, program enrollment, number of physicians, per cent
never-married, labor force participation,
and low income are also higher for Black
than white women. In contrast, white
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 25, No. 3

SAU’s show higher migration rates than
Black SAU’s.

Table 2 presents the metric and beta
coefficients by race of causal variables hypothesized to influence childless and
cumulative fertility rates of fecund
women. For each of the two white and
two Black equations the beta coefficients
indicate the relative importance of variables within each equation, and the metric
coefficients measure the change in a dependent variable that is related to a oneunit change in each independent variable,
net of other predictors in the equation.

In analyses of white fertility, population
density, Southern residence, low education, migration, family planning program
enrollment, per cent never married, and
labor force participation, all show significant and expected effects on rates of
childlessness. Only density of physicians is
unrelated. The metric coefficient for
never-married women is slightly greater
than 1.0, a plausible finding because 88
per cent of never-married whites in this
age group are childless, and the variable
also is a proxy for older age at marriage of
wives. The two effects on childlessness
should be additive.

Determinants of Childlessness

175

The parallel analysis of white CEBM
supports the interpretation that the causal
structure of childless rates is similar to that
of cumulative fertility among fecund
women. Six of eight variables show significant opposite-sign effects on the two
measures of fertility, providing evidence
that the factors affecting childless rates
parallel those that affect the number of
children ever born to fecund women.

An exception to this pattern is the same
sign for the rate of never-married women.
The variable influences rates of childlessness as expected, but has a small, though
significant, positive effect on CEBM.
Among white women, the never-married
rate is more highly correlated with population density (y = 0.50) than with any other
variable. Separate regressions showed that .
deleting population density from the white
analysis caused the effect of the nevermarried rate on CEBM to become negative as expected.

The beta coefficients show that the
never-married variable is by far the most
important measure in the white childless
equation, while labor force and population
density are the two next most important,
followed by migration, program enroll

ment, and Southern region with relatively
similar effects.

Among Blacks, the beta coefficients indicate that the three most important determinants of childlessness are labor force
participation, the never-married rate, and
population density. Southern region, low
education, program enrollment, and
number of physicians are also significant,
but of lesser importance, and migration is
of borderline significance. All eight variables have expected effects on Black
childless rates.

For Blacks, seven of eight variables
have significant opposite-sign effects on
the two measures of fertility. For example,
population density increases childlessness
while decreasing children per 1,000 mothers; labor force participation increases
childlessness among Black women while
decreasing CEBM, and low education
decreases childlessness and_ increases
CEBM. We take these findings as further
evidence that the relationship of independent variables to rates of childlessness is
not the result of concomitant areal variation in involuntary sterility. The socioeconomic determinants of CEBM also affect
rates of childlessness.

Comparing coefficients for Black and
white women, the effect of one variable,
Southern residence, shows a marked interaction with race. Sly (1970) reported a
similar interaction. For Blacks, the
finding of higher fertility and fewer childless women in the South supports research
by Farley (1970, p. 116). The opposite pattern for whites has also been documented
previously (Cain and Weininger, 1973)
with 1960 census data.

The smaller never-married effect (measured by the metric coefficient) on
childlessness among Black than among
white women reflects the greater incidence
of illegitimacy in that subgroup (Cutright,
1973). Effects on childless rates of popula

tion density, low education, migration,
program enrollment, physicians, and
labor force participation are similar
among Black and white women.

DISCUSSION

Despite racial differences in illegitimacy
and control over first births, the socioeconomic determinants of childlessness and
CEBM are similar in the analysis of Black
and white women. One major exception,
the strong interaction of race with the effects of Southern region on fertility, mirrors findings reported by Ryder and Westoff (1971, Table 4-7) and may decline
with time.

The results of nonrecursive regression
analyses of childlessness, when compared
to analyses of fertility among women of
proven fecundity, suggest that areal variation in rates of childlessness among older
American women in 1970 is highly structured. Fifteen of 16 variables show significant effects on the number of children
per mother (p = 0.10). Of these 15 vaniables, 13 were also significantly related to
childlessness in the opposite direction, as
hypothesized by the voluntaristic theory.

The effects of sociodemographic variables on childless rates were compared
with those on cumulative fertility rates of
women who had borne at least one child.
By definition, these latter effects are not
attributable to areal variation in involuntary sterility. Thus, the strong similarity in
the causal structures of childless and
cumulative rates of mothers should not be
explained as a spurious result of variation
in the inability to bear a first child.

These results provide strong but indirect support for the voluntaristic theorists’
contention that areal variation in 1970
