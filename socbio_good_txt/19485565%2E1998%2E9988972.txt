ABSTRACT: The study examines Chinese fertility in Canada in the context of minority-status and
fertility. Chinese-Canadians are compared with British-Canadians, who are considered in this
analysis as the majority group. The study is unique in three ways. First, we argue that discrimi
nation brings a minority group not only psychological insecurity but also social-economic inse
curity, which can be measured by Chinese husbands’ economic status relative to the British. Second, we analyze the relationship between discrimination against the Chinese at the social class
level and Chinese fertility behavior at the individual level, which has been ignored by most previous studies. Third, we describe “insecurities” effects to explain the fertility behavior of the
Chinese across social classes, including the lower classes to which many researchers believe the
minority status hypothesis is not applicable. We conclude that discrimination variations over social classes combined with normative influence are a major factor in causing class fertility differ
entials between the Chinese and the British in Canada.

Since the mid 1970’s the Chinese have
grown to be the largest visible minority
group in Canada. There were 586,645
Chinese-Canadians enumerated in the
1991 census, constituting 2.2 per cent of
the total Canadian population and 7.6 per
cent of all immigrants.' The present study
intends to examine Chinese fertility in
Canada in the context of the association
between minority-status and fertility. The
Chinese are compared to the British, who
made up 23.5 per cent of the Canadian
population in the 199] census and are
considered in this analysis as the majority
group in the sociological sense.

We choose British-Canadians rather
than the whole whites because BritishCanadians are not only the majority of
the whites but also the largest ethnic
group in Canada. They best reflect the social-economic characteristics of the ma

jority at the average. Chinese-Canadians
are one ethnic group among the minomnties. Comparing them with an ethnic
group rather than the whole whites would
avoid possible biases.

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE

A dominant approach in the literature
on minority group fertility is the characteristics hypothesis which predicts that
the distinctive fertility of a racial subgroup arises from the unique social, demographic, and economic distinctions
characterizing the minority group. Therefore, it is not race or ethnicity per se but
the “characteristics” associated with race
or ethnic membership that are thought to
have causal import for explaining subgroup fertility. It may be deduced from
this thesis that when the soctal, demographic, and economic characteristics of
minority and majority populations become similar, through statistical standard

ization or at some time in the future,
group differences in fertility will disappear (Lee and Lee, 1959). This explanation is also called the assimilationist perspective (Jiobu and Marshall, 1977).
However, this hypothesis fails to take into
account the presence of discrimination
against a minority group and the effects
of discrimination on minority fertility behavior.

The minority-status hypothesis developed by Goldscheider and Uhlenberg
(1969) introduces the role of discrimination into the analysis of minority fertility
behavior. This hypothesis posits that dis
' crimination against minority members

per se affects fertility independently of
compositional differences between the
minority and majority. Their argument is
based in part on their analysis of fertility
differentials of blacks and whites in the
United States. When variables such as education or place of residence were controlled, the more highly educated blacks
showed lower fertility than the highly educated whites, thus contradicting expectations of the characteristics hypothesis.
The assumed causal mechanism in this
effect was explicated as being the depressing effects on black family size of
upward mobility in combination with minority status. The social-psychological insecurity felt by upwardly mobile blacks
translates into reduced fertility in relation
to upwardly mobile whites, who by virtue
of their majority status do not feel the
same degrees of “insecurities” as do
members of a disadvantaged minority
group.

The attention gained by the minoritystatus hypothesis has stimulated extensive
empirical tests and commentaries in various parts of the world, especially between
the 1970’s and the 1980’s (Sly, 1970;

   

Chinese Fertility 173

Ritchey, 1975; Kennedy, 1973; Jiobu and
Marshall, 1977; Bean and Marcum, 1978;
Johnson, 1979; Johnson and Nishida,
1980; Goodkind, 1995; Burr and Bean,
1997). However, this hypothesis has not
received overwhelming support in the literature because of a number of factors.

First, researchers have not discovered
direct indicators to measure insecurity
caused by discrimination. In order to distinguish the function of insecurity from
social-economic characteristics, Goldscheider and Uhlenberg stress the importance
of psychological mechanisms. They argue that well-educated minority members
experience insecurity psychologically and
that the desire for social and economic
mobility induces them to work hard
and to reduce their childbearing. Since
insecurity is considered a psychological
variable, it is very difficult to operationalize.

Second, previous studies have focused
on either the aggregate or the individual
levels of analysis and have paid less attention to comparative analysis at the social
class level. An absence of such analysis
would result in ambiguous conclusions.
For instance, a fertility similarity between
a minority group and a majority group at
the aggregate level may conceal significant fertility differentials between the two
groups at the social class level. In addition, most studies have failed to realize
that discrimination against minority members varies across social strata. Thus, the
degree of discrimination experienced by
minority members varies by one’s social
class, which would affect fertility behavior differently among minority members
in different classes.

Third, Goldscheider and Uhlenberg
claim that the minority-status thesis best
applies to minority members within the

174

middle and upper classes. In their opinion, education is the key indicator of assimilation. Once minorities achieve the
average education level of the majority,
according to the characteristics hypothesis, their fertility level should converge to
the majority. However, as observed, welleducated blacks, who have been assimilated to the majority educationally, have
lower fertility than the whites. This situation, Goldscheider and Uhlenberg believe, is caused by the minority status. On
the contrary, the poorly educated blacks
have higher fertility than the majority.
Goldscheider and Uhlenberg explain that
it is because the desire for upward mobility (which makes the psychological insecurity active) is not as strong as among
minority members in the middle and upper classes. Accordingly, minority-status
or “insecurities” effects related to discrimination cannot be assumed to apply
in the explanation of fertility behavior
among lower class members. The above
viewpoints may in fact be too limiting.

Johnson (1979) suggests that the higher
fertility of less educated blacks might be
explained wholly by their disadvantageous
social, demographic, and economic characteristics. Because her thesis is based on
the comparison between the blacks at low
classes and the whites in general, it is less
applicable to explaining why poorly educated minority members possess higher
fertility than majority members who have
the same social-economic characteristics
and are at the same classes.

Perhaps this situation can be best explained by normative influences, as suggested by Roberts and Lee (1974), Fisbie
and Bean (1978), and Gurak (1977). That
is to say, poorly educated minority members may have higher fertility than their
majority counterparts because they are

strongly influenced by the group’s pronatalist norms when the minority group as
a whole possess an identifiable pronatalist
culture. Yet, according to Goldscheider
and Uhlenberg, minority groups having a
pronatalist ideology are not considered as
subject to the minority-status and “insecurities” effects. In such cases, high income
would likely encourage rather than depress the fertility of minority members in
middle and upper classes. From the above
discussion, we can see that the minoritystatus hypothesis only applies to certain
ethnic groups and certain social classes. It
would be desirable to develop, ultimately,
an explanation of the fertility behavior
across all minority groups and across all
social classes.

RESEARCH STRATEGY

The present study is intended (1) to
find a direct indicator to measure degrees
of discrimination and insecurities, and (2)
to explore the impact of discrimination
and insecurities on the fertility behavior
of the native-born or Canadian-born Chinese across social classes.

We choose native-born or Canadianborn Chinese to test the function of discrimination on fertility for the following
reasons. First, the native-born ChineseCanadians are highly assimilated to the
majority. In Figure 1, there are five educational levels: elementary school, junior
high school, high school, university (undergraduate studies including bachelor
degree), and master degree and beyond.
Native-born Chinese married males (aged
17-51) and females (aged 15-49) have a
much higher percentage with university
and higher degrees than the British of the
same age category. In Figure 2, occupation is classified as four categories: Skill I

(manual jobs), Skill II (clerical workers
and semiskilled manual workers), Skill
III (semiprofessionals, supervisors, and
senior clerical workers), and Skill IV
(managers and professionals). Chinese
males and females are more concentrated
than the British in the categories of Skill
III and IV. These comparisons indicate
that the native-born Chinese are highly
integrated into the educational and occupational structures of Canadian society.
In fact, they surpass the British on these
variables.

Second, the Chinese have a pronatalist
ideology. Previous studies of Chinese fertility in North America all assumed that
there is no pronatalist ideology associated
with this group (Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969; Jiobu and Marshall, 1977;
Johnson, 1980; Chui and Trovato, 1989).
In fact, traditional Chinese culture is
very pronatalist (Cleland et al., 1983;
Coale, 1984; Stacey, 1983; Croll, 1985;
Banister, 1987; Tang, 1995). Freedman
and Coombs (1974) organized and coordinated a project concerning sex preference among developing and developed
countries in the early years of the 1970's.
According to their report, Taiwan belonged to the group with strong son preference. The mean number of sons preferred by the Chinese in Taiwan was 2.1
and the mean number of desired children
was 3.9, which was not only higher than
those of European countries and the
United States, but also higher than those
of most developing countries, including
India, Korea, and Thailand. Son preference is a key mechanism in formulating
Chinese pronatalist culture and is also directly related to the desire for a large
family size.

Since World War II Chinese reproductive norms have changed gradually over

Chinese Fertility 177

time. The norm of large family size has
been replaced by small family size. It has
been reported that the total fertility in the
whole Chinese world dropped dramatically in the 1980’s. However, it cannot be
assumed that pronatalist ideology has
completely vanished. Traditional reproductive norms concerning family size still
exert a certain influence on some Chinese
families, especially in the countryside
and among the poorly educated. Since the
traditional family value of continuing
clans and generations sustains strong influence on Chinese family life, son preference (as well as universal marriage to
some degree) has not lost its significance
in reproductive norms. This family value
would keep the fertility rate in the Chinese world higher than in the Western
world (Huang, 1982; Arnold and Liu,
1986; Freedman, 1986; Cooney and Li,
1994). From Table 1 we can see that as
compared with British-Canadians, the
Chinese fertility pattern in all the three
major Chinese areas displays pronatalist
endowments. Even at the youngest age
group (20-24), which could be most
Westernized, the Chinese women (except
for those in Hong Kong) have more children than British-Canadian women.

One may assume that such pronatalist
influence should also exist in some degree among the Chinese in North America. Based on an estimation made by
Basavarajappa and Halli (1984), the Chinese in Canada had the second highest
fertility among a large number of Canadian ethnic groups between 1921 and
1961. According to the 1971 Canada census, Chinese women aged 15-49, including both foreign-born and native-born,
possessed a higher fertility rate than
British-Canadians at the average as well
as at almost every education level. These

> As explained by the minority-status
gy hypothesis, discrimination engenders insecure feelings among minority group
members. Yet, the consequences of dis= crimination is not only psychological but
Aalso physical, mainly appearing as economic insecurity. Economic insecurity,
which determines social security, plays
the same role as psychological feelings in
driving minorities to work hard, and, at
the same time, reinforces the insecure
feelings (see Figure 3).

Economic insecurity, as an index of
discrimination, could be measured quantitatively. We develop such a measure by
taking the ratio of annual income per

schooling year of minority members divided by the same value of majority members (i.e., British-Canadians in this paper).
We call this Relative Economic Status
(RES). As salary (or wage) reflects the extent of discrimination more accurately than
income, in this study, salary is employed
in the estimation of RES. If Chinese-Canadians have the same education as BritishCanadians, controlled for age or working
experience, but do not earn the same
amount of money, we assume there is discrimination against them. Starting from
this point of view, if the RES ratio is close
to or more than unity, the Chinese have the
same as or relatively better economic status than the British, and therefore greater
economic security and less discrimination.
If the ratio is less than unity, the Chinese
have a relatively inferior economic status,
which means less economic security (or
stated differently economic insecurity compared to the British), and greater discrimination. This ratio could be calculated for
individuals, social classes, and communities to determine individual economic security, class economic security, and com

munity economic security respectively,
presenting degrees of discrimination at
the three levels.’ Since this study focuses
on the effects of group context on individual behavior, RES at social class level
or class economic security will be most
often used.

With regard to attained social-economic status, education might be one area
where minorities would perhaps experience the least discrimination. However,
equalization of education levels would not
necessarily offer minority members the
same job opportunities. It was observed
that blacks’ occupational chances in the
United States were consistently inferior to
whites (Blau and Duncan, 1967; Blau,
1987; Gill, 1993). According to the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men
(NLS), for these individuals who stated

‘Individual RES (in society) = individual wage per
schooling year of the minority/community mean of annual wage per schooling year of the majority. Individual
RES (in specific class) = individual wage per schooling
year of the minority/class mean of annual wage per
schooling year of the majority. Class RES = class mean
of annual wage per schooling year of the minority/class
mean of annual wage per schooling year of the majority.
Community RES = community mean of annual wage
per schooling year of the minority/community mean of
annual wage per schooling year of the majority.

that they desired to work in managerial
sales and clerical, and craft occupations,
blacks were significantly less likely than
whites to end up working in these occupations, controlling for such factors as education and training background.

Even if minority members are offered
the same job as majority members, pay
may not be equal. Blau and Duncan (1967)
noted that in the United States the occupational status of both the Japanese and the
Chinese was higher than that of the whites,
but the income level of whites was nevertheless the highest of all ethnic groups.
They believed that this discrepancy must
be attributed to ethnic status itself and
probably to discrimination. Minority members are more likely integrated into the educational institution than into the institutional income. The 1995 CPS (Current
Population Survey) reports that the people
who have an education of four years of
college account for 24 per cent of the
whites and 28.5 per cent of the Asians in
the United States. But, per capital income
is $18,304 for whites and only $16,567 for
Asians. Thus, income, especially wage differentials at the same education level, may
be viewed as an objective indicator of
degree of injustice against the minority.
 

180

Economic insecurity among minority
groups may be reduced by female labor
force activity. In our patriarchal society,
discrimination against minorities often
concentrates on minority males. If a minority husband has inferior RES, his wife
would probably work hard to supplement
family income and thus maintain living
standards compatible with their social
_,, Status, which could be represented by the
= & husband’s education. The average living
a standard within a specific social class is
usually modelled on the consumption
% level and pattern of the majority group,
A which may explain why levels of em% ployment among black women have his26 torically exceeded those of white women
co in the United States (Shapiro and Mott,

= 1979; Herring and Wilson-Sadberry,
3 1993). A high level of wives’ labor force
Sbparticipation would, all things being
5 equal, reduce childbearing. In this sense,
a it could be proposed that husband’s RES
© is a principal factor in shaping a house= hold’s family size. These mechanisms are
© shown in Figure 3.

We will explore the relationship be—tween discrimination against Chinese
© males at a given social class (or at a given
2 education level) and Chinese females’
& fertility behavior at both individual and
E social class levels. We are interested in
& husbands’ RES at the social class level

because discrimination against minorities

varies with classes. It has been observed
that white-nonwhite income differentials
in the United States increase with increasing education. The largest income
differential between whites and nonwhites was observed for men with some
college. In 1995, the amount of earnings
for African Americans without a highschool education was 94.9 per cent of the
income of whites. African Americans

with a high school education earned 89
per cent, and African Americans with a
college education earned 72 per cent.
Thus, discrimination against minorities
is probably more severe in the middle
and upper classes than in lower classes.
We hypothesize that the lower the education level of Chinese husbands, the less
severe the discrimination against them
and thus the greater the relative degree of
economic security. In such a context,
there is less necessity for Chinese wives
to work hard, and as a result the fertility
of the Chinese relative to that of the
British at a given class will be higher. By
contrast, the higher the education level of
husbands, the more severe the discrimination and thus the lower the husbands’
relative economic security. Correspondingly, there is greater necessity for Chinese wives to work hard, and therefore
the fertility of the Chinese relative to that
of the British at a given class will be
lower. Pronatalist culture is assumed in
our hypothesis that improvement in Chinese husbands’ economic security (as
measured by RES) will positively affect
their family size. At higher levels of economic insecurity, the effect of pronatalism
on fertility becomes unimportant, because
it would be overcome by considerations
of economic security.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data from the Public Use Sample
Tape (PUST) of the 1991 Canada census
are utilized in this study. The unit of
analysis is native-born or Canadian-born
currently married women aged 15—49 of
Chinese or British ethnicity. It is impossible to acquire current fertility data from
the 1991 Canada census. As an alternative, this study employs the number of

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

children ever born as a proxy on the assumption that Chinese women maintained their social-economic characteristics until the time of the 1991 census.

A major issue in studies conducted in
the past regarding minority-status is that
immigration effects were not separated
from other fertility determinants, which
is perhaps one reason why there appeared
contradictory findings in previous research concerning Chinese fertility in
North America. Some studies employed
intercept difference in the minority/majority regression decomposition equation
(Jiobu and Marshall, 1977; Halli, 1987)
to explain the role of minority-status in
Chinese fertility behavior. As immigrants
make up a large percentage of the Chinese living in North America, the intercepts could be affected by various factors
in immigration process and therefore can
not be regarded as pure functions of minority status. In addition, immigrants
would possibly compare their income
with their economic conditions in their
home countries, so that their conclusions
about their economic security could be
very different from their Canadian-born
compatriots. Furthermore, as immigrants
do not speak fluent English and could not
find a job relevant to their education,
their relative economic status (RES)
would be worse than their native-born
compatriots. Under this situation, minority-status effects or insecurities effects on
fertility behavior could be distorted.
Choosing the native-born Chinese excludes the possible confounding influence from immigration.

This study is concerned with how Chinese husbands’ economic status influences their wives’ fertility behavior. Data
on husbands’ social-economic variables
and wives’ variables would be needed.

181

Unfortunately, the PUST file does not
contain explicit information on the Chinese (as they are lumped with “other ethnicities’’). We use data from the individual file and assume that married Chinese
males are husbands of married Chinese
females in the same file. Strictly speaking, some of these assumed “linked” couples are not in actuality married. Since
this study focuses on the role of group
context (i.e., husband, class, economic
security) on individual behavior, this assumption is not very problematic. In order to eliminate international marriage,
only respondents who married a Chinese
person are considered in this study. Generally, the age difference between wives
and husbands is about two years (husbands being older); married males aged
17-51 are included in this study to complement the females aged 15-49. It is
commonly held that traditionally Chinese
women should not marry men who are
less educated than they (Cheung, 1988;
Leete, 1994). We found from the family
file in the 1980 Canada census that 67.3
per cent of Chinese women were married
to men with the same education and 28.2
per cent of them were married to men
with higher education. Under the circumstances, we assume that Chinese wives
have the same education as their husbands and therefore are in the same social
class as their husbands.

appears in Chinese husbands’ RES at
four occupation categories. The higher
the occupational class, the lower the
RES. These figures show clearly that discrimination against the Chinese is more
severe at middle and upper classes than at
lower classes.

The amount of wage could be affected
by working experience. We did not find
significant changes as compared with the
actual RES after standardizing Chinese
husbands’ RES on the length of working
experience (age minus numbers of years
in school), which means, even controlled
for age or working experience, Chinese
husbands at middle and upper classes still
make less money than the British. This
finding demonstrates that the wage differentials between the two groups are
mainly generated by discrimination.

Table 3 shows a comparison of number
of weeks worked in 1990 and labor force
participation rates between Chinese and
British wives. The ratios of Chinese wives’

weeks worked and labor force participation
rate relative to the British go upward while
their husbands’ relative economic status
(RES) goes downward. The higher the
Chinese wives’ education level, the more
the weeks worked as well as the higher the
labor force participation rate compared to
British wives. This finding is consistent
with our expectations that Chinese husbands’ RES or economic security would
have a bearing on their wives’ labor force
activity. One may argue that our assumption about women’s working to supplement a deficit in husbands’ income ignores
other influences. However, even though
other factors such as self-satisfaction play
important roles in women’s employment,
we cannot deny that economic initiatives
are still the most active driving power.
Apart from economics, we are unable to
explain why well-educated Chinese
women worked more time than the British
women with the same education. In 1981,
as a result of working more, AfricanAmerican women with four years of college or more earned 82.3 per cent as much
as similarly educated black men, whereas

white women earned only 66.5 per cent as
much as white men. Meanwhile, African
American women with a junior-highschool education or less earned 71.1 per
cent as much as black men, whereas white
women eared 63.8 per cent as much as
white men (Mellor and Stamas, 1982). Obviously, this finding cannot be attributed to
African-American women’s higher initiatives of self-satisfaction.

One may also argue that insecure feelings of their own desires for mobility
drive highly educated Chinese wives to
work hard. If we extend the comparison
to nonmarried Chinese women aged
15-49, this picture would be clearer.
Table 4 indicates that nonmarried Chinese
women at most education levels work less
and have lower labor force participation
rates than their British counterparts. Their
employment behavior is evidently different from that of married Chinese women.
This finding suggests that nonmarried
Chinese women do not experience the
pressure from men’s economic insecurity
and do not need to work as much as married Chinese women, who need to keep
their living standards compatible with
their family social status. Desires for mobility could exert a certain influence on
the married Chinese women. However,

the pressure resulted from their husbands’
inferior RES would be the most important
driving factor in their employment. For
most Chinese, family income still depends highly on husbands’ income.

Table 5 shows the fertility (i.e., the
number of children ever born) to Chinese
and British wives. There is no education
level of elementary school for the Chinese women in this sample. Chinese fertility at three education levels including
high school, university, and master degree beyond, is lower than that of the
British. At junior-high-school level, the
Chinese have higher fertility.

Figure 4 summarizes the relationship
between Chinese husbands’ RES (as
shown by Column 1 in Table 2) and Chinese wives’ fertility behavior at class levels. The latter is operationalized as the ratio of Chinese fertility relative to that of
the British (as shown by Column 3 in
Table 5) and follows the trend of the former, the index of economic security. This
finding illustrates that Chinese husbands’
economic security has a positive impact
on their wives’ childbearing. In other
words, discrimination against the Chinese
husbands at a given social class negatively affects their wives’ fertility behavior. From the figure we can see that the

two curves do not overlap and that there
is a gap between them. The discrepancy
reflects effects of other variables. For instance, at the middle- and upper-class
levels, a psychological feeling of insecurity and desire for upward mobility may
shift the curve of relative fertility further
downward. Meanwhile, traditional pronatalist norms may cause a positive vertical
translation effect to the curve of relative
fertility at lower classes. The negative
gap between Chinese husbands’ RES and
wives’ felative fertility rate becomes
wider with increasing education, which,
on the one hand, demonstrates the function of decreasing economic security

(RES), and, on the other hand, reflects
the elasticity of response to RES. Chinese
families in the highest social class are
highly sensitive to their relative economic
status (RES). Economic insecurity would
change their fertility more significantly
than it does on families in other classes.

MULTI-LEVEL ANALYSIS

The previous section mainly illustrates
the relationship between Chinese husbands’ economic security and their
wives’ fertility behavior at class levels. In
this section, we will examine how the
discrimination at a given social class affects Chinese women’s individual fertility

behavior. The appropriate _ statistical
method for the analysis of variables at
two different levels, social classes (i.e.,
macro-level) and individuals (i.e., microlevel), is contextual analysis, which concerns the role of group context on
the actions and attitudes of individuals
(Iversen, 1991). A fundamental assumption of contextual analysis is that the micro values of the response variable in
some way depend on the social context,
and the effects of the micro determinants
may vary systematically as a function of
the social context. A Chinese wife’s
childbearing is affected by not only her
individual social, economic, and demographic characteristics, but also the social-economic environment, that is to say,
it is affected by discrimination against
her husband in the class context. Here,
Chinese husbands’ RES at a given class is
regarded as a macro-level variable.

It is said that ordinary least-square regression model (OLS) would result in unreliable estimates of standard errors in
dealing with multi-level analysis (Cochran, 1977). The random-coefficient model
(RC) can handle data collected at different levels of a hierarchy in an appropriate
way (Kraft and Leeuw, 1994). In this
sense, RC model is utilized in this study.
Suppose we have P explanatory variables
Kai (p = l,......P) at the individual level,
and Q explanatory variables G,; (q = 1,
— Q) at the social class level, following
the approach of Mason, Wong, and Entwisle (1984), the micro equation 1s given

The intercept Bo and the slopes B.. are

where G is the macro regressor. Equations (2) and (3) represent the effects of
contextual characteristics G, on the two
parameters of the micro model. We acquire a single equation expression for the
multilevel model by substituting Equation (2) and (3) into Equation (1):

This model is a mixed model, containing fixed coefficients (the 1’s) and random coefficients (the «’s).* Children-everborn (CEB) by married Chinese females
aged 15-49 is the dependent variable Yj.
We have five independent variables at the
individual level, including age, income,
employment or labor force participation

force = 0), weeks worked in 1990
(WEEKS), and education (EDU, total

years of schooling).* One independent
variable is measured at the class level:
Chinese husbands’ RES within five education levels (i.e., elementary school, junior high school, high school, university,
and M.A.+).

A principal assumption of RC model
is that elements at both group and individual levels are randomly sampled.
Some scholars have considered social
classes as fixed categories. In this study,
however, social classes are assumed randomly sampled because the classes are
categorized on the randomly selected elements. Therefore, classes in this study
could be considered a sample of classes
in population.

To make a comparison with multilevel analysis, we first use an ordinary
least square regression model (OLS) to
test the effects of individual level variables on Chinese wives’ fertility behavior. The regression equation is given by

cients, and e. is the error term. We have
five independent variables at the individual level as mentioned previously. Generally, women would have more children
with their increasing age during their reproductive span. We expect that age will
have positive effect on CEB. It is hypothesized that income would negatively affect women’s fertility behavior because,
under most situations, behind high income, there is usually more working time
or more schooling years, which would reduce fertility. Labor force activity will
also negatively affect CEB. Chinese
women who participated in labor force
would possibly bear fewer children than
those not in labor force. Meanwhile, Chinese women who worked more time will
possibly have fewer children than those
who worked less time, assuming that
these women had held this working pattern by the census time. Finally, we expect that there will be a negative relationship between schooling years and CEB.

The multivariate regression coefficients are given in Table 6. AGE has a
positive effect and all the other variables
have negative effects on children ever
born, suggesting that Chinese fertility increases with age, but decreases with the
increasing education, labor participation
rate, working time, and income. This is
consistent with the observation of most
previous studies. All independent variables are statistically significant except
for employment (EMP).

We now switch to the random-coefficient model (RC) to execute the contextual analysis. Following the approach
adopted by Hox (1994) in his research,
we first examine the micro-level-only
model, which contains explanatory variables at the individual level as fixed variables. Equation (4) simplifies to:

 

Chinese Fertility

187

Yi; = Noo + "9 oi +
(a; + Xai OD + g, ) (6)
(terms defined earlier).

The RC model omits EMP which was
not significant in OLS model. The program MLn is employed in the computation.® The parameter estimates, constant,
and two variance estimates, o2 for the
residual variance at the class level, and
o2 for constant variance at individual
level, are summarized in Table 7.

The signs of these parameter estimates
are the same as those in the OLS model
and all the estimates are statistically significant.

The next step involves the addition of
the class variable G.. (i.e., macro-level
variable), Chinese husbands’ RES at five
education levels, to this model, giving the
following equation (terms defined earlier):

Vig = Noo + Nog Gai + Myo Xpiy *

(A; + X,;,0,,; + Ei) (7)

The parameter estimates, constant, and
variances are summarized in Table 7.
Chinese husbands’ RES is a “structural”
variable at class level, meaning that the
measurement is made from community or
group characteristics not from individuals. Therefore, we could avoid the possibility of an issue of inter-correlation between class-level and individual-level
variables.

The subsequent model is Equation (4),
which is a complete single equation of
RC model and includes interaction terms

of micro (individual) variables and macro
(class) variables. In this study the only
significant interaction term is that of
Weeks Worked with the class variable
RES (WEEKRES). We only show this
term in Table 7.

The comparison of the variances across
the models and deviances based on the
chi-square test show the fit of the different
models (Hox, 1994). From Table 7 we can

see that the values of g2 and g2 reduce
from one model to the next; thus, both the
individual and class variables explain a
significant portion of the initial variance in
children ever born. Moreover, the more
terms in the model, the smaller the values
of the deviance. Hence, the more complete
models provide a better fit.

After adding the class variable to the
model, we discover that Chinese husDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

bands’ RES has a positive effect on children-ever-born. That is to say, if discrimination against Chinese husbands at a
given class is reduced, Chinese husbands
would be more secure economically and
then their wives would have more children. The sign of the interaction term involving WEEKS (which could be regarded as the indicator of women’s labor
force activity) and RES indicates that improved economic security within a given
class would lower the negative effect of
Chinese wives’ working on fertility. This
point can be further explored in Table 8,
which displays the partial derivatives of
wives’ weeks worked on children ever
born conditional on husbands’ RES level.
This table illustrates that the negative effect of Chinese wives’ working on children-ever-born becomes weaker when
Chinese husbands’ relative economic status becomes increasingly better. This result could be explained from two perspectives. First, Chinese wives would
probably reduce their labor force activity
and consequently increase their childbearing when their husbands have better
economic security (higher RES). Second,
Chinese wives in upper social classes
may feel more pressure than those at
lower classes due to their husbands’ low
RES. If the former work the same time as
the latter, the former would have fewer
children.

DISCUSSION

The descriptive statistical analysis
shows that the native-born Chinese have
been well integrated educationally and
occupationally to the majority group, represented by British-Canadians. However,
they have not achieved the same economic status as the British even controlling for age and working experience. We

hypothesized that this finding is a function of discrimination. Chinese husbands’
relative economic status deteriorates with
increasing education. The most severe
discrimination occurs at the highest education levels, suggesting that the door
leading to the ruling class and managerial
stratum for the Chinese is not open
widely.

As indicated in most previous studies
of minority-status and fertility, we observed that at low levels of education the
Chinese-Canadians have higher fertility
than the British-Canadians and that at
high levels of education Chinese fertility
is below that of the British. Correspondingly, we found that as the relative economic status of Chinese husbands rises,
the fertility of Chinese wives relative to
the British also rises, and vice versa.

The Chinese people in Canada are a
minority group with a relatively high fertility culture. Their fertility behavior is
affected by both minority status (i.e., discrimination) and pronatalist ideology (as
compared to the mainstream culture). To
illustrate the effects caused by the two
conflicting functions, we need to introduce the concepts of economic security
in society and economic security in specific social class.

Discrimination against a minority operates at both the society level and social

190

class level. The two types of discrimination would separately affect a minority
male member’s income relative to the average earned by the majority in society
and his income relative to the average
earned by the majority in a given social
group with which it is identified. This
discrimination would determine the minority member’s economic security in society and also his economic security
within a class.

In general, a minority member’s economic status as well as social status is
limited by his education. On the one
hand, he will not be able to pursue the
economic status beyond his education.
On the other hand, he will not be satisfied
with the economic status which cannot
provide him with the same average living
standard as the majority in his social
class (characterized by education). Therefore, for a minority family, the husband’s
relative economic status or the index of
economic security or insecurity in his social class (which also determined his social status in that class) may be of more
significance than his relative economic
status in society. In other words, a minority family would most likely seek economic security accommodated with their
social class. As a result, in affecting minority individual reproductive behavior,
discrimination in a given social class,
which directly determines a minority
member’s class economic security, plays
a more important role than discrimination
in society, which explains why we focus
on the impact of discrimination in the
class context.

It seems that discrimination against the
Chinese is less severe at low classes than
at middle and upper classes. A poorly educated Chinese man may feel secure economically in his class despite his inferior

Tang and Trovato

economic status in society. In this context,
the traditional Chinese pronatalist ideology would serve to enhance childbearing.
A well-educated Chinese man may feel
insecure economically in his social class
even though his economic status is relatively favorable in society, as compared
with low classes. In this situation, his
pronatalist orientation would be overridden by economic security considerations,
his wife would likely increase her labor
force activity, and fertility would therefore decline. However, it does not mean
that pronatalist ideology has less influence on the middle and upper classes than
on the low classes, but rather means that
economic insecurity would weaken Chinese normative influence. Our contextual
analysis denotes that if discrimination is
reduced and economic security improved,
due to the inherently pronatalist culture,
the Chinese people would probably increase their childbearing regardless of the
level of education.

We may conclude from this study that
economic insecurity (or security) measured by RES within a given class combined with normative influence could be
a critical factor in affecting class fertility
differentials between the Chinese and the
British in Canada. For the Chinese at
middle and upper classes, as long as discrimination against a minority does not
disappear altogether, the Chinese will not
be able to entirely achieve the same economic and social status as the British and
therefore will not feel secure economically and socially, even if they have successfully assimilated educationally and
occupationally. Consequently, they will
reduce their fertility. For the Chinese at
low classes, where discrimination is not
so severe as that at middle and upper
classes and where they have relatively

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

better social and economic status within
their classes, the pronatalist culture
would influence them to bear more children. Under the circumstances, class fertility differentials between the two groups
will not necessarily disappear. The ethnic
fertility discrepancy is mainly attributed
to the normative distinctions and socialeconomic inequalities. These distinctions
and inequalities are determined by ethnicity and discrimination. In this sense,
this study affords a certain support to the
minority-status hypothesis.

An important limitation in this study
is imposed by a lack of available information. For instance, current fertility data
would be more valuable in establishing
an explicit causal model for Chinese fertility behavior and determinants. One dimension that needs to be explored in future studies is to extend the study of
discrimination thesis to other minority

Chinese Fertility

191

groups. We have concluded that discrimination variations over social classes are a
major factor causing fertility differentials
between the Chinese and the British in
Canada. Whether this conclusion is applicable only in the Chinese case or it is
of general significance depends on the
application of the thesis to other groups.
