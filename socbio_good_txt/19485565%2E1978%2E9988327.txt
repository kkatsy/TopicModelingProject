Age at Menarche, Socio-sexual Behavior,
and Fertility

ABSTRACT: This paper examines the relationship between age at menarche and fertility from two
perspectives. Age at menarche is regarded as a crude indicator of the timing of fecundity that may
affect the timing of conception among those sexually active; and age at menarche is regarded as a
crude indicator of the timing of sexual maturation that may influence the timing of socio-sexual
behavior, namely dating and sexual intercourse. The data are drawn from a survey of New York
City women who recently had their first child. The findings suggest that age at menarche as an
indicator of fecundity is not a good predictor of the timing of the first birth, when controlling for
age at first sexual intercourse. Looking only at initial noncontraceptors, however, we find the
relationship is stronger. Age at menarche, viewed as an indicator of the timing of sexual maturation, does seem to have some influence on the timing of dating, but only for Blacks. For both

 

races, age at first date is related to age at first sexual intercourse.

The onset of menstruation (menarche)
may be considered a crude indicator of
when the female: reproductive span begins. Initially, cycles tend to be relatively
long and irregular, and the incidence of
anovulatory cycles is high (Reymert and
Jost, 1947-48; Presser, 19746). Full fecundity may not be achieved until several
years later, if then. Since age at full fecundity cannot be directly assessed, it is
crudely estimated by adding two or three
years to age at menarche. The median age
at menarche in the United States is 12.8
(U.S. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare, 1973); thus, a reasonable
guess at the median age at full fecundity is
about 15.

The apparent decline in the age at
menarche, estimated to be about one year
per generation (Damon et al., 1969; U.S.
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, 1973), along with the rise in fertility among teenagers under 16 years of
age (Baldwin, 1976), has led to some

speculation about the relationship between the two trends. Cutright (1972) has
argued that the two trends are related, although his analysis focuses on trends in
illegitimacy among teenagers rather than
on total teenage fertility; moreover, because the data come from different
sources, the direct relationship between
age at menarche and teenage fertility for
individuals is not examined. Our search
through the literature uncovered only one
study that directly examines this relationship.! Comparing a small sample of pregnant teenagers with a control group of
nonpregnant teenagers, the investigators
found that those pregnant had an earlier
age at menarche (Gottschalk et al., 1964).

1 Ryder and Westoff (1971) examined the relationship between age at menarche and fertility for married women of all parities, based on data from the
1965 National Fertility Survey. Acknowledging that
the analysis was undertaken “purely out of curiosity,” they found that age at menarche was inversely
related to pregnancy. For the first year of nonuse of
contraception, those who were youngest at menarche
generally had the highest pregnancy rate.

The expectation that a declining age at
menarche serves to increase teenage fertility assumes that the corresponding change
in fecundity among females is a critical determinant of fertility; that is, more young
women are “at risk” of conceiving. This
risk is relevant, however, only to young
women who are sexually active. It could
also be argued that age at menarche, insofar as it is related to the level of sexual
maturation, may influence the timing of
dating and sexual intercourse. In other
words, age at menarche among those
teenagers who are sexually active may affect not only the risk of conceiving, but
also the timing of exposure to this risk.

In this paper, we shall consider both aspects, using data from a survey of recent
mothers. First, we shall consider some of
the socioeconomic correlates of age at
menarche. Next, we shall examine the relationship between age at menarche and
the timing of first births, controlling for
the effect of age at first sexual intercourse.
Age at menarche will then be examined in
relation to socio-sexual behavior, spesifically age at first date and age at first
sexual intercourse. Differences by race
will be considered. Before exploring these
relationships, we shall briefly describe the
sample.

THE SAMPLE

The basic purpose of the overall study
was to examine factors associated with
mother’s age at first birth. A sample was
drawn from the birth records of women
residing in the New York City boroughs of
Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens who
had their first child in July of 1970, 1971,
or 1972. The sample was restricted to
Black or white mothers born on the U.S.
mainland who had singleton first births
and were aged 15-29 at the time of their
first birth.2 This age range constitutes

2 The median age at first birth for this New York

Age at Menarche and Fertility 95

about 90 per cent of all first births in New
York City.

A stratified random sample of women
was drawn from those who met the above
conditions. It included married and unmarried women of all economic statuses.
A total of 541 eligible cases was located,
and 408 were interviewed (75 per cent of
those eligible). The interviews were conducted in person during the period January 15-March 14, 1973.3

The sample is comprised of women who
have recently carried a pregnancy to term.
Thus, we are looking at the process
whereby age at menarche may affect the
timing of the first birth for a sample of
fecund women who, in their recent past
(and perhaps earlier) were exposed to the
risk of conception.

SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AND AGE
AT MENARCHE

The literature suggests that nutritional
levels affect age at menarche; females with
poor nutritional histories tend to have
later ages at menarche (Tanner, 1968).
Various indicators of socioeconomic
status, which are highly related to nutrition, also seem to be associated with
menarcheal age (Zacharias and Wurtman,
1969; Carfagna et al., 1972).

In our study, we may consider two
background factors as indicators of socioeconomic status during early adolescence:
race and the respondent’s mother’s education.4 We would expect that both Blacks

City sample (ages 15 to 29) is 21.5-22.7 for whites
and 19.0 for Blacks. This figure closely compares to
the median age at first birth for the total United
States (all ages) of 22.1 in 1972—22.4 for whites and
19.7 for Blacks (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1977, Table 1-13).

3 For further description of the sample, see
Presser, 1974a. There have since been two follow-up
interviews in 1974 and 1976, but these data are not
included in the present analysis.

* Mother’s education is used rather than father’s
education or a combined measure of both parents

and women whose mothers had little education would have relatively late ages at
menarche. On the other hand, data for the
total United States suggests that the age at
menarche for Blacks is earlier than that
for whites (U.S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, 1973). This
finding runs counter to other studies of
more select populations that show the reverse (Zacharias and Wurtman, 1969).

For our sample of New York City
mothers, Black women report a later age
at menarche than do white women. The
mean ages are 12.7 for Blacks, and 12.3
for whites (12.5 for the total sample).* The
mode, or most frequent age at menarche,
is 13 for both races. As may be seen in
Table 1, there is a substantial difference in
the proportion of Blacks who experienced
menarche at the late ages of 15 to 18 (17
per cent) as compared to whites (5 per
cent). The differences in the distributions
are significant at the 0.01 level.

Mother’s education is only weakly associated with age at menarche. As shown in
Table 2, women whose mothers had less
than 8 years of education were oldest at
menarche (mean age, 12.6) in contrast to
those whose mothers were high-school
graduates or better (mean age, 12.4). It
may be noted that the sharpest contrast by
mother’s education is the per cent who
were ages 15 to 18 at menarche: 13 per
cent of those whose mothers had less than
8 years of schooling compared with only 4
per cent of those with mothers who had
completed 13 years or more.

AGE AT MENARCHE AND FERTILITY

We now turn to the question of whether
there is a direct relationship between age

Only 4 per cent grew up without a real, step-, or
adoptive mother in the home. In these cases, ‘the
education of the mother-substitute was used.

5 Age at menarche is reported as age at last birthday (as are all age data in this paper). To estimate
actual age in months, the figures would need to be
inflated by 0.5.

become mothers at an early age women
who experienced menarche at an early
age? The Pearson product-moment correlation between the exact age at each event
is weak (r = 0.07; p > 0.05). Considering
each race separately, however, we find a
stronger relationship for Blacks (r = 0.19;
p < 0.01) than for whites (r = 0.09; p >
0.05). The data in Table 3 indicate that
Black women who had their first birth in
their late twenties were especially likely to
have had a late age at menarche; 47 per
cent were aged 14 to 18.

If age at menarche is to be considered as
a fecundity measure that influences the
timing of first births, then we need to control for differences in exposure to the risk
of conception. A relevant control is age at
first sexual intercourse. Accordingly, we
may ask: Given a similar time of first exposure to the risk of conception, does age
at menarche affect fertility? As may be
seen in Table 4, the partial correlations
between age at menarche and age at first
birth, controlling for age at first sexual intercourse, are weak and are not statistically significant, either for the total or
separately for Blacks or whites. (We excluded from this analysis the eight women
who first had sexual intercourse before age
14, since other women who did have such
early sexual experience and had a child

before age 15 are excluded from our sample.) Thus, although age at menarche may
be a crude indicator of fecundity, it does
not seem to differentiate the timing of the
first birth for those who initiate sex at similar ages.

It may be argued that age at first sexual
experience is too crude an indicator of exposure to conception and that a better test
of the fecundity effect of age at menarche
would be achieved if we considered only
those women who were not contraceptive
users. Women were asked whether they
used any method of contraception at the
time of first sexual intercourse; 48 per cent
said no. Although most women did not
conceive their first child at this time, even
when they did not use contraception, we
can assume that those who did not use
contraception at first sexual intercourse
represent a disproportionate number of
subsequent irregular or noncontraceptive
users.© For this relatively high risk subgroup, does age at menarche relate to age
at first birth when controlling for age at
first sexual intercourse? As may be seen
again in Table 4, the partial correlation for
this subgroup as a whole is 0.16. The relationship is stronger for whites (0.22) than
for Blacks (0.18). Thus, there is some evidence that in the absence of contraceptive
use—at least at the time of first sexual
experience—early age at menarche may be
related to early age at first birth.

Another factor relevant to the risk of
conception, in addition to contraceptive
use, is the regularity of sexual intercourse.
Clearly, among noncontraceptors, those
who have sexual intercourse regularly
generally are more at risk of conceiving
than those who do not. Women were asked
whether, soon after their first sexual experience, they had intercourse regularly,

contraception at first sexual intercourse were women
who at the time of first interview reported that they
have never used contraception.

occasionally, or only that once. Only 37
per cent responded that it was regular.

For the high risk subgroup of women
who did not use contraception the first
time and had sexual intercourse regularly
soon after (15 per cent of the total sample),
we may ask: Is age at menarche related to
age at first birth, when we control for age
at first sex? As may be seen in Table 4, the
answer is negative. The partial correlation
for the total sample is 0.03. For whites it is
much greater (0.23); for Blacks, there is a
strong inverse relationship (—0.63), but
this finding is based only on nine cases.

Limiting the analysis to this apparently
high risk subgroup of sexually active
women does not, then, strengthen the
positive correlation for initial noncontraceptors between age at menarche and
age at first birth when we control for age
at first sexual intercourse. It may be that
regular sexual activity, even for those who
did not initially use contraception, is associated with regular contraceptive use; this
use could offset the positive effect of age at
menarche on the timing of first births.

We have thus far been considering factors associated with the risk of conception.
Conception, of course, does not necessarily lead to alive birth. Fourteen per cent of
the women in the sample experienced
either a miscarriage or induced abortion
prior to their first birth. Thus, in exploring
the relevance of menarche as a fecundity
variable, we need to examine the relationship between age at menarche and age at
first pregnancy (including miscarriages
and induced abortions). Repeating the
preceding analysis for age at first pregnancy rather than age at first birth, we
found the partial correlation coefficients
generally were somewhat weaker (data not
shown), leading us to interpretations similar to those above.’

7 It should be remembered that this is a sample of
first-parity mothers and excludes women who may
have been pregnant but never had a child.

AGE AT MENARCHE AND SOCIOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR

We have been considering age at
menarche as a fecundity variable having a
biological influence on fertility. Age at
menarche may also be considered as a
crude indicator of sexual maturation, having a sociological influence on the timing
of dating and sexual intercourse. These
aspects of socio-sexual behavior may, in
turn, be related to the timing of first
births, although we are unable to consider
this issue here, given the nature of the
sample (young mothers necessarily had
early ages at first sex).

First, let us consider dating behavior.
To the extent that dating behavior is
influenced by the sexual maturation of females, we would expect to find that those
who mature early would begin to date
early. This supposition is supported by our
data. The correlation between exact age at
menarche and exact age at first date is 0.16
(p < 0.001). Considering each race separately, however, we find the relationship is
strong for Blacks (Yr = 0.29; p < 0.001),
but almost nil for whites (7 = 0.01; p >
0.05). As may be seen in Table 5, in general, Blacks started dating at a somewhat
later age than whites. Controlling for age
at menarche, however, we see that later
dating for Blacks is specific to those who
experienced menarche at age 12 or later.
Both races show similar mean ages at first
date for those who experienced menarche
at ages 9 through 11. Blacks who experienced menarche at ages 14 to 18 are especially late daters, both in relation to other
Blacks and in relation to whites of similar
menarcheal age.

It would seem that a delay in dating
would be associated with a relatively late
age at first sexual intercourse (irrespective
of whether or not one marries). This hypothesis is supported by the positive correlation between exact age at first date and

exact age at first sex (r = 0.26; p < 0.001).
The correlation is particularly strong
among Blacks (r = 0.61; p < 0.001), but
holds for whites as well (ry = 0.26; p <
0.001). The interval between first date and
first sexual intercourse is smaller for
Blacks (an average of 1.6 years) than for
whites (an average of 4.9 years). Thus, although Blacks began going out with boys
at a later age than whites, they began having sexual intercourse at an earlier age. As
may be seen in Table 6, earlier sexual experience among Blacks is evident for all
ages at first date. It may also be noted that
early dating for Blacks seems to be especially conducive to early sexual experience—at least for women who subsequently have children. Blacks who
began dating before age 14 were, on the
average, 14.8 years old when they first experienced sexual intercourse.

Although marriage may postpone the
timing of first sexual intercourse for some
women, it is not highly relevant in this
analysis. Over one-fourth (28 per cent) of
the women in our sample were not married at the time their first child was born.

The percentage is much higher for Blacks
(58 per cent) than for whites (8 per cent).
Even for those women who did marry
prior to motherhood, most did not postpone sex until marriage. Fifty-one per cent
reported a younger age at first sexual intercourse than at first marriage; 66 per
cent for Blacks and 47 per cent for whites.
For the remainder who gave identical
ages for both events, some may still have
experienced sex prior to marriage (anywhere up to a year before).

CONCLUSION

Our data suggest that age at menarche
as an indicator of fecundity (controlling for
age at first sexual intercourse) does not
seem to be a good predictor of the timing
of motherhood for women in general. It
may be that differential contraceptive use
offsets whatever effect fecundity might
have as a determinant of fertility. When
considering only those who did not use

Presser

Social Biology

contraception at the time of first sex, we
found the partial correlations to be
stronger both for whites and Blacks. In
other words, for noncontraceptive users,
early menarche may increase the risk of
conception and influence the timing of the
first birth.

As an indicator of sexual maturation,
age at menarche appears to have some
influence on the timing of dating for
Blacks. For both races, age at first date is
correlated with age at first sexual intercourse, but this correlation is particularly
strong for Blacks. Although we cannot
consider the relationship between age at
first sexual intercourse and age at first
birth with this truncated sample, we
would expect this relationship to be
strong. Accordingly, at least for Blacks,
age at menarche may be regarded as a determinant of socio-sexual behavior that
may, in turn, influence the timing of
motherhood.

This analysis suggests that attributing
the increase in early adolescent fertility to
the declining age at menarche requires further specification about contraceptive use
and the process by which age at menarche
affects socio-sexual behavior. There is a
clear need for research in this area.
