Inbreeding and Reproductive Parameters

Among Mennonites in Kansas

ABSTRACT: The relationship between inbreeding and certain reproductive parameters was
studied by analyzing the reproductive history questionnaires collected from 194 women who
attended a research clinic in the Mennonite community of Goessel, Kansas, and for whom
pedigrees were constructed from data at the Mennonite Historical Library and at the
Alexanderwohl Church. Five reproductive parameters, age of menarche, age of menopause,
length of reproductive span, number of children, and fetal wastage, were compared in inbred
and noninbred women. There is no consistent evidence that absence of inbreeding or degree of
inbreeding (F = 0.00024—0.0332) significantly affects these reproductive parameters in this
sample of Mennonite women. If inbreeding does have an effect on these reproductive variables,

it is too small to be detected in this sample.

Inbreeding depression in domestic
and experimental animals has long been
known to result from the mating of biologically related individuals. Falconer
(1960) in his discussion of inbreeding depression states that the reduction in
mean phenotypic values with inbreeding
is greatest for traits that are associated
with reproductive fitness. Thus, characters such as litter size or lactation in
mammals are more strongly affected
than those such as bristle number in
Drosophila, which shows little or no
change.

The effects of inbreeding in human
populations have been a topic of research for many years. Most published
studies have been concerned only with
the consequences of inbreeding in the
fetus, i.e., the offspring of parental consanguinity. But one can also study parental inbreeding by seeing if reproductive parameters of the individual are
affected by his or her own degree of inbreeding. In this paper the parameters
of age of menarche, age of menopause,

180

reproductive span, number of living
children, and fetal deaths will be examined in relation to degree of inbreeding
in women of the Mennonite community
of Goessel, Kansas. These data are part
of a large multidisciplinary study on aging carried out at the University of Kansas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MENNONITE POPULATION

The Mennonite community of Goessel traces its historical origins to the Przechowka Church in West Prussia in
1669. The members kept very good records which documented the population’s growth and eventual migration to
Russia in 1821. There, the congregation’s name was changed to Alexanderwohl in honor of the Czar. Later, in
1874, political and economic conditions
in Russia led the population to move to
the United States. Once in the United
States, the group partitioned into three
parts. The group that settled in Goessel

(40 miles north of Wichita) became
known as the “New Alexanderwohl”
congregation. The Alexanderwohl
Church underwent fissioning in 1909
and 1920, when two daughter congregations formed. This study focuses on the
New Alexanderwohl Church and its
daughter congregations—the Goessel
Mennonite Church and the Tabor Mennonite Church. All of these congregations are members of the General Conference of Mennonite Churches. More
details of Alexanderwohl history can be
found in Crawford and Rogers (1982).
The Goessel community is a stable,
homogeneous population living in a relatively low-stress environment. Members of this population share a common
religion, history, and form of subsistence, farming. Thus, the rich historical
record and homogeneous socioeconomic conditions make Goessel an ideal
population in which to compare reproductive parameters in inbred and noninbred women of the same community.

METHODS

Adult members of the Mennonite
community of Goessel were invited to
participate in a multidisciplinary study
on aging in January, 1980. The research
team which included anthropologists,
sociologists, psychologists, physioiogists, and medical doctors established a
research clinic to provide a meeting
place where the data could be collected.
Five hundred and seventy (570) individuals participated in the Goessel research
clinic. This number represents 51 per
cent of the adult resident membership of
Alexanderwohl, Tabor, and Goessel
churches. The participants consisted of
258 males and 312 females.

Women attending the clinic were
asked to fill out a reproductive history
questionnaire. The questionnaire ob
Mennonites in Kansas 181

tained information on age of menarche
and menopause, number of living children, pregnancies and fetal wastage
(miscarriages and stillborns), and if the
individual had undergone hormone
treatment, used the pill, or undergone
surgery affecting reproductive organs.

Pedigree data were collected at the
Mennonite Historical Library in North
Newton, Kansas, and at the Alexanderwohl Church in Goessel by Laurine
Rogers, formerly of the Department of
Anthropology, University of Kansas.
Of the pedigrees collected, 62.5 per cent
were five generations or more and 37.5
per cent were four generations or less.
Inbreeding coefficients were calculated
according to the method of Wright
(1922) by Dr. Rogers.

Reproductive variables of the inbred
and noninbred women were compared
using Student’s ¢ test. For analyses of
menopause and length of reproductive
span, all women who had surgery
(oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or
who had used the pill or had undergone
hormone treatment were excluded from
the analysis. Women using other forms
of birth control were not excluded.
Comparisons of numbers of children
and fetal wastage (miscarriages and stillborns) used data from women who had
completed their families. Women who
had experienced natural or surgical
menopause formed this group.

Further analyses included regressing
the reproductive parameters on F (inbreeding coefficient) and a Pearson’s
correlation matrix of the parameters.
Because there was such a wide range in
the degrees of inbreeding among the
women, the inbred group was divided
into three levels of inbreeding. The levels were determined by the F value that
is equivalent to the “‘n” values of the inbreeding coefficient formula, F = 4 x

1/2" (Wright, 1922). The reproductive
variables in each inbreeding level were
analyzed by Student’s ¢ test to determine
if degree of inbreeding had effects on
the parameters.

Both age at menarche and age of
menopause constitute recall data. The
inaccuracy of retrospective data is well
documented (Damon et al., 1969).
However, in order to examine the effects of parental inbreeding, one must
know age of menarche and menopause
in the same woman. Except for a few
studies like Treloar’s (1974) large prospective study in Minnesota, longitudinal data are not used. Therefore, most
status quo studies collect menarcheal
data from school girls and menopausal
data from an older female group. In this
study, one has to use recall data so that
age at menarche and age of menopause
are obtained from the same woman.

RESULTS

Of the 312 female participants in the
research clinic, 279 completed reproductive histories. The women ranged in
age from 18 to 93 with an average age of
54.5 years. Of the 279 women, pedigrees had been previously constructed
for 194 of the women answering the
questionnaires. Sixty-four (64) of these
women were inbred and 130 were not inbred. Individual inbreeding coefficients
(F) ranged from a low of 0.00024 to a
high of 0.0332. The average F of the
group of women for which pedigrees
were available was 0.003.

Table 1 compares five reproductive
parameters between inbred and noninbred females. Women in the inbred
group have F>Q and women in the
noninbred group have F = 0, The numbers () in each category of the analysis

swer every question and others could
not answer each question because of
their reproductive status (had not
reached menopause, had not completed
their family, had surgical menopause or
hormonal treatment, etc.). For example, some individuals did not give age of
menarche; others had not reached menopause. Both of these factors would affect the n’s of each of the five parameter
categories.

Although the inbred group does have
a later menarche and a shorter reproduction span, these differences are not
statistically significant, as in age of menopause. Live children and fetal deaths
were compared in inbred and noninbred
women who had completed their families. Fetal wastage is the average number of spontaneous abortions or stillbirths per woman. The two groups had
essentially the same average number of
children. The inbred group experienced

less, instead of more, fetal loss. However, this difference was not significant
according to the f test.

To examine further the effects of inbreeding on reproductive factors, we
performed regressions of age at menarche, age at menopause, reproductive
span, number of children, and fetal
wastage on F coefficients > 0. Neither
menarche, menopause, reproductive
span, nor fetal loss was significantly affected by the degree of inbreeding.
However a significant regression coefficient of 0.37 (p < 0.02) was obtained
when number of children was regressed
with F. In other words, women with a
higher degree of inbreeding had more
children. This of course is the opposite
of the prediction of the working hypothesis that inbreeding will depress reproductive fitness.

Pearson’s correlation coefficients,
shown 1n Table 2, essentially confirm the
results of the regression analyses. There
is no Significant correlation between F
coefficient and menarche, menopause,
and fetal wastage; and there is a positive
correlation with number of children.
Reproductive span is also significantly
correlated with F. Again, this is not expected with the working hypothesis that
inbred women have shorter reproductive spans.

In an attempt to elucidate why inbred
women have more children, the data
were examined to see if age were correlated with F by regressing number of
children with age. This could demonstrate a possible volitional shift to a
smaller family size in younger women
and a possible lower degree of inbreeding in younger women. Neither statistic
was significant; neither family size nor F
has a relationship to age in this sample.

Since there is such a large difference
in degrees of inbreeding among the
women (0.00024—0.0332), the F coefficients were divided into three groups:
Group 1 is the least inbred with
F< 0.0039; Group 2 is the intermediate
level with F values = 0.0040—0.0156;
and Group 3 is the most highly inbred
with F> 0.0156. Student’s t tests were
used to compare each inbred group by
pairs in order to see if the level of inbreeding was affecting age of menarche,
age of menopause, length of reproductive span, number of children and fetal
loss. Figure 1 shows the comparison of
the three levels of inbreeding and reproductive parameters. The n’s vary in each
parameter category for the same reasons given earlier. There is one less individual in the high F group and reproductive span because one woman did not
report age of menarche. The women in
the three inbred groups whose data are
analyzed in the children and fetal wastage categories are women who had experienced natural or surgical menopause. No significant differences were
seen comparing menarche, menopause,
span, number of children, and fetal
wastage. Though not statistically significant, the high inbred group surprisingly had an earlier menarche, later
menopause, longer reproductive span,
and more children per woman than the
low inbred group. These results are the

expect the inbred women would have
later menarches, earlier menopauses,
shorter reproductive spans, fewer children, and more fetal wastage. The
results of this study do not support this
hypothesis. Except for two positive correlations of children and reproductive
spans with inbreeding coefficient, there
appears to be no difference between inbred and noninbred women. Compared
to animal studies, this analysis is limited
by the small sample size and by the low F
coefficients in general. Inbreeding depression among animals is often studied
in full sib matings where the F of the offspring is 0.25.

A review of the literature has not
found any other studies that analyzed
the effect of degree of inbreeding on age
of menarche, age of menopause, and
length of reproductive span. However
there have been many studies investigating inbreeding and human fertility.
None of the largest and best designed
studies has demonstrated a consistent
significant effect of parental consanguinity on the frequency of deaths
(Schull, 1958, 1959; Schull and Neel,
1965; Schull et al., 1970a; Schull et al.,
19705; Schull and Neel, 1972; Hook and
Schull, 1973; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977).
These references are studies of Schull,
Neel, and their colleagues in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki and later in Hirado, Japan, and the investigations of Rao and
Inbaraj in Tamil Nadu, South India. In
relation to the positive correlation between F and number of children found
in this paper, it is noteworthy that the
parental inbreeding portion of the
Hirado study showed that inbred wives
had significantly more pregnancies and
livebirths than noninbred wives (Schull
et al., 1970a). In Schull’s study, the inbreeding coefficients of the inbred sam
Mennonites in Kansas

185

ple ranged from second cousins to first
cousins (F = 0.0156 to 0.06). The Mennonite women were not as highly inbred; only 15 of the sample had F values
in the range of 0.015 to 0.06 and of those
none had a F value higher than 0.0332.

Aside from Schull’s and his colleagues’ study in Hirado, there are only
two other reports dealing with parental
inbreeding. Warburton and Fraser
(1964) in their analysis of reproductive
histories of women at Montreal Children’s Hospital found no difference between abortion frequency among wives
of inbred and noninbred husbands. In
another study, Tanaka et al. (1967)
found a significant increase in sterility
among inbred wives, but no effect in inbred husbands living in Hoshino and
Kurogi, Japan.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, there is no consistent
evidence that inbreeding significantly
affects the reproductive parameters of
age of menarche, age of menopause,
length of reproductive span, number of
children, and fetal loss in this sample of
Mennonite women. The next step in the
analysis of this sample is to establish
which of the husbands of these women
are inbred and to obtain their F coefficients. In view of previous studies,
however, the conclusions outlined in
this paper will probably stay the same: if
inbreeding does have an effect on these
reproductive parameters, it is too small
to be detected in this sample.
