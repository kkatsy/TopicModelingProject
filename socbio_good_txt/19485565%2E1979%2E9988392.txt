A Comment

ABSTRACT: The negative correlation between annual homicide and fertility rates reported by Lyster
(1974) is confirmed by statistical analysis, which is extended to show that the correlation is largely
confined to the post-World-War-II years and holds for whites and nonwhites in nearly equal degree. Data are shown to support the hypothesis that homicide and fertility rates are responding to
variations in psychological stress among young adults associated with swings in relative cohort size,
the proportion of those age15-29 to those age 30-64. It is suggested that periods of increase in the
relative number of young men weakens their labor market position, and the result is to increase
psychological stress, to discourage traditional role fulfillment such as family building, and to encourage antisocial behavior, indexed here by the homicide rate.

In a brief report, William R. Lyster
(1974) points out a negative correlation
between annual homicide and fertility
rates in the United States for the period
from around 1910 onward. Although stating that “an acceptable explanation does
not readily present itself,’ Lyster suggests
that the relationship is not spurious and
may reflect variations in what he calls ‘‘social stress’’ (Lyster, 1974, pp. 389, 390).
The purpose of this brief note is to extend
further both the statistical analysis and
suggested explanation.

Lyster does not actually present statistical correlations, commenting only on the
apparent relationship between the homicide rate for the total population and two
other series that he presents, the fertility
rate of the total population and that of the
nonwhite. We have computed the Pearsonian correlation coefficients between the
total homicide rate and his two fertility se
ries. They are, respectively, —0.62 and
-0.67 and are statistically significant at the
99% confidence level (Table 1, Col. 1,
lines a and Db).

In addition to up-dating the period covered, we have extended the statistical
analysis in several ways: (1) The years
1942 through 1945 are omitted on the
grounds that the war years are subject to
unusual influences. (2) Correlations are
done separately for the homicide and fertility rates of the white population and of
the nonwhite population. (3) Correlations
are run for the years preceding and following World War II (Table 1, lines c and d).
The results show clearly that the correlation between homicide and fertility is
largely confined to the post-World-WarII years and that in that period it holds for
whites and nonwhites in nearly equal degree.

What is responsible for this pattern? In

our view both homicide and fertility are
responding to variations in psychological
stress among young adults associated with
swings in relative cohort size, the proportion of those aged 15-29 to those aged
30-64, a variable that has come to the
forefront in the period since World War
Il. The reasoning, briefly stated, is as follows': Other things constant, an increase
in the relative number of young men, asin
the period since 1960, weakens their labor
market position and thereby their ability
to realize their economic aspirations. The
result is to increase psychological stress, to
discourage traditional role fulfillment

1A fuller statement of this reasoning appears in
Richard A. Easterlin (1980), Chaps. 2 and 6. This
view with regard to the determinants of homicide is
similar to that of Robert K. Merton (1968) and AlIbert K. Cohen and James F. Short (1971).

such as marriage and family building, and
to encourage antisocial behavior such as
crime, indexed here by the homicide rate
(though, of course, relatively few persons
resort to extreme behavior such as crime).
The opposite is true when the relative
number of young men declines, as occurred between World War II and the late
fifties. In this period the economic situation for young men was relatively good
and was reflected in an adherence to traditional household roles, a decrease in psychological stress, and a decline in crime
rates. Before World War II the relative
number of young men did not exhibit a
marked swing, and the labor market was
importantly affected by immigration and
major fluctuations in labor demand, both
of which have since been largely stabilized
by government policies. Hence the corre

lation does not hold or holds 6nly weakly
in the earlier period.

In support of this hypothesis, we
present in linese and fof Table 1 the correlations with relative cohort size of the
homicide rate and fertility rate. Note the
very high correlations in the post-WorldWar-II period (Col. 4) consistent with our
expectations, in contrast to the preWorld-War-II correlations, which are
either insignificant (homicide) or in the
wrong direction (fertility)?

The inverse relation between homicide
and fertility appears to be paralleled by a
similar inverse relation between suicide

and fertility in the period since the 1930's,
which has been pointed out by Martin
O’Connell (1975) and explained by him
along lines similar to ours. Clearly the
suicide and fertility relationship buttresses
the present viewpoint and suggests the
need for broader investigation into the
economic and social manifestations of cohort size.

"In the case of homicide, if data relating
specifically to young males (15-24) rather than the
population as a whole are used, the correlation
coefficient in Col. 4 is virtually identical (0.97). The
problem with data by age, however, is that they refer
to victims rather than perpetrators of murder.
