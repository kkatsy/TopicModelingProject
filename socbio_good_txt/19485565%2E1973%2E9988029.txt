Symposium on the Human Genetic Load

A symposium entitled “What Is Happening to Gene Frequencies in Man?” will be
held in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 24,
1973. It will be sponsored jointly by the
American Society of Human Genetics and
by the Society for the Study of Social Biology. The symposium will be held on the
opening evening of the annual meeting of
the first society and in connection with the
annual business meeting of the second
society.

Barring late changes, the symposium program will include: “Medical Implications
of the Genetic Load,” W. J. Schull “Exposure of Modern Populations to Mutagenic
Agents,” H. E. Sutton; “Anticipated Effects
of Carrier Detection, Intrauterine Diagnosis, and Reproductive Compensation,” G. R.
