Female Age at Marriage and the
Birth Rate In India

C. R. Malaker

Indian Statistical Institute
Calcutta, India

Studies conducted in various parts of
India have established an approximate,
though not consistent, relationship between
female age at marriage and completed
family size. In the Mysore study (United
Nations, 1961), it was observed that females marrying between the ages of 14 and
17 gave birth to 5.9 children, while those
marrying between 18 and 21 years eventually gave birth to only 4.7 children. A
study in Calcutta among a middle-class
urban population (Poti, Malaker, and
Chakravorti 1960) showed that females
marrying below age 14 gave birth to 6.3
children, those marrying between 15 and
19 gave birth to 5.1 children, and those
marrying between 20 and 24 gave birth to
only 3.7 children.

Similar relationships have also been observed in model studies conducted by
demographers in different parts of the
world. Using a stable population model,
Coale and Tye (1961) demonstrated that
postponement of marriage can contribute
substantially to a reduction in birth rates
and population growth. This contribution
is potentially greatest in those countries
which have high fertility and a low average
age at marriage. William Leasure (1963)
showed that when the mean age at marriage in Bolivia rose from 22.5 years to 27.2
years, the birth rate declined from 41 to
30, or by about 27%, and that in Turkey,

 

when the female mean age at marriage rose
from 19,7 to 27.2 years, the birth rate declined from 50 to 33, or by about 34%.

In studies on the Indian birth rate, it has
been estimated that when the female age at
matriage is raised to nineteen or twenty
years, the birth-rate reduction ranges from
16% to 50% (Agarwala, 1964, 1965).
Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967) observed that the decline in the birth rate
would not be more than 10% by increasing
the minimum age at marriage to nineteen
to twenty years in India. Their findings
have been criticized by Talwar (1967) who
commented that their approach seemed to
involve many questionable assumptions.

On the other hand, several studies conducted in India and elsewhere (Sinha,
1952) gave no evidence of any consistent
relationship between age at marriage and
completed family size. This may be due to
differences in marriage cohorts associated
with different socioeconomic, cultural, and
ethnic characteristics.

Here an attempt has been made to study
the effect of female age at marriage on the
birth rate by considering a fixed marital
fertility schedule for Indian females, unchanging over time irrespective of the marriage habits of the population. The object
is to answer the simple question: If the
marital fertility schedule continues to operate in its present form but female age at

marriage is increased, what will be the effect on population growth?

The effect on fertility of increasing the
age at marriage of Indian women has been
considered for four different values of mean
age at marriage, namely, 15, 17, 19, and 21
years. The age at marriage of females for
rural and urban India by states (Government of India, 1961) was critically examined by applying MHajnal’s method
(1953) over the marital distribution of females for all India. Table 1 gives those

The averages of percentages of unmarried females for the states detailed in Table

at marriage derived therefrom. The states
included in each pattern resemble one
another closely in the marital distribution
of females. The percentage of unmarried
women in each five-year age group for each
“pattern” is presented in Table 2. By
considering averages of several states, bias
in reporting marital status may be assumed
to be minimized. The four patterns listed
in Table 2 show an association between increasing age at marriage with a relatively
higher percentage of single women in all

age groups. Moreover, the pattern associated with the highest age at marriage exhibits an unusually high percentage of
ultimate spinsters.

Regarding measures of fertility, three
indices have been considered: (a) the
crude birth rate (CBR); (5) the net reproduction rate assuming all marriages to
be taking place at the singulate mean age
at marriage (NRR,); and (c) the net
reproduction rate using nuptiality tables
(NRRg). Finally, a simple index, the total
fertility rate (TFR), has been calculated.

Crude birth rate (CBR): To ascertain
the effect of increasing age at marriage on
the CBR, the age-specific marital fertility
rates were taken from Vital Statistics of
India, 1961 (Government of India, 1963).
The averages of percentages of married females for different states included under a
particular age-at-marriage pattern were
taken as representative. The above percentages were applied to the all India female
age distribution in 1961 to arrive at the adjusted number of married females by fiveyear age groups. The crude birth rates were
then obtained as presented in Table 3.

From the above calculations it was observed that when the mean age at marriage
changes from 15 to 17 years there is practically no change in the CBR. If the mean
age at marriage increases to 19 years, the

riages at the singulate mean age at marriage
(NRR;): The following results are based
on a calculation which assumes (@) all females marry at the singulate mean age;
(5) all marriages are first female marriages
and remarriages are assumed negligible;
(c) mortality rate is independent of marital status; (d@) the age difference at marriage between males and females is 5 years;
(e) the sex ratio at birth is 0.4878.

The marital fertility rate for the age
interval 17-20 has been estimated linearly
from those of the age intervals 15—20 and
20-25, assuming any rate for an interval to
correspond approximately to the midvalue
of the interval. The net reproduction rates
corresponding to the four mean ages at
marriage of 15, 17, 19, and 21 years have
been calculated and are presented in Table
4,

Thus, with an increase in age at marriage
of 2, 4, and 6 years, the reductions in the
net reproduction rate are 3.3%, 8.7%, and

matriage for each pattern.

16.8%, respectively. The above figures are
comparable to the results obtained earlier.
Net reproduction rates using nuptiality
tables (NRR,z): From a cohort of 100,000
females, the net nuptiality tables corresponding to the four different marriage patterns enumerated earlier have been constructed (Malaker, 1970, 1971). Thus, the
number of female marriages within each
five-year age group have been obtained.
Assuming marriages to be distributed
uniformly throughout the year of age (x,
x-+-5), the average age at marriage may
be taken as x -+- 2.5. Table 5 shows a section of the net nuptiality tables corresponding to the four different marriage patterns.
The net reproduction rates corresponding
to the four marriage patterns have been
calculated and are given in Table 6.
Compared to those in Table 4, these

figures are lower by about five points. This
is partly due to the fact that all females do
not get married. The figures in Table 6,
however, are more representative of the
actual situation and are quite consistent
with the results obtained in previous sections. According to the above calculations,
an increase in age at marriage of 2, 4, and
6 years would result in percentage reductions in reproduction rates of 3.5%, 8.9%,
and 17.3%, respectively.

Total fertility rate (TFR): Here an
alternative approach to the measurement
of the effect of increasing age at marriage
on population growth is considered. To
study the effect of increasing age at marriage on the total number of children ever
born, an approximate measure of the completed family size, the ideal method is to
trace a cohort of married women marrying
at a particular age x and subjected to a
constant marital fertility schedule with no
mortality. Any difference observed in such
indices may be ascribable to differences in
age at marriage. Symbolically, if f, is the

Assuming all females marry at 15, 17,

and are presented in Table 7.

From Table 7 it can be observed that
when the mean age at marriage changes
from 15 to 17 years, the TFR declines from
6.35 to 6.04, or by about 5%. When it
increases to 19 years, the TFR declines
from 6.35 to 5.73, or by about 10%. With
an increase in age at marriage to 21 years,
the TFR declines by 17%.

SUMMARY

The study of the effect of increasing age
at marriage on fertility reveals a consistent
relationship between the two variables.
Different measures of fertility have been
considered, and it should be noted that
numerically they need not give identical
results. The percentage reductions in the
CBR are larger compared to other measures, particularly for postponement of
marriage for a longer number of years.
However, a close correspondence between
the different fertility indices and the corresponding percentage reduction strengthens
the basis of our analysis.

Thus, for an increase in age at marriage
of 2 years from 15 to 17, the CBR reduc

tion seems to be insignificant. A similar
result is obtained with other measures of
fertility. It appears there is a critical level
below which postponement of marriage will
not reduce the fertility index (Das, 1965)
to a significant extent. However, if the
mean age at marriage changes from 15 to
19 years, the CBR falls by 11%, the NRR
by 9%, and the TFR by 10%, approximately. With an increase in mean age at

marriage of 6 years, from 15 to 21, the
corresponding fertility reductions are 24%,
17%, and 17%, respectively. As observed
by Talwar (1967), our study also reveals a
larger percentage reduction of fertility,
approximately on the order of 20%, when
age at marriage increases from 15 to 21
years. These results are at variance with
those obtained by Basavarajappa and
Belvalgidad (1967).
