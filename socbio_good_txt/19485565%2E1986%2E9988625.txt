Patterns of Mortality and Causes of Death
Among Rhode Island Jews, 1979-1981

ABSTRACT: Using information provided by institutions handling Jewish deaths, this study
identified 735 deaths among Jewish residents of Rhode Island during 1979-81. Official death
records then provided data on the characteristics of the deceased and on cause of death,
allowing comparisons of Jewish/non-Jewish patterns of mortality and cause of death, as well as
analysis of differentials among the Jewish decedents, taking account of birthplace and
occupation. The findings indicate that relatively fewer Jewish males die at ages below 65, and
more at ages 85 and over than is true of total white males. Jewish females exhibit an
age-at-death pattern more similar to that of all white women. These sex differences characterize
cause of death as well. Differences are more pronounced between Jewish and non-Jewish males
than between the female groups. Most noteworthy, Jewish male deaths from diabetes are
significantly higher and deaths from respiratory disease significantly lower than among total
white men. Differentials in age of death between Jewish native-born and foreign-born are
largely a function of their differential age composition, and socioeconomic status showed no

 

clear relation to age at death or cause of death.

Although considerable interest exists
in Jewish mortality patterns and how
they compare to those of other ethnic/
religious subgroups in the American
population, only a limited number of
studies have undertaken such analyses.
Research is problematic because information on religion is not collected either
in the U.S. census or on vital records.
Definitive large-scale studies are therefore difficult and rare, and our knowl
edge of ethnic/religious differentials in

mortality must perforce be built up from
the accumulated evidence of small-scale
studies covering diverse subgroups at
various points in time. Nonetheless, interest in the possible distinctiveness of
Jewish mortality can be expected to
grow with the increased aging of both
the Jewish and American populations.
Studies for St. Louis (Gorwitz, 1962),
New York (Seidman et al., 1962), and

87

Providence (Goldstein, 1966) identified
a number of differences between Jews
and non-Jews: Mortality was generally
lower at younger ages for Jews than
non-Jews; the reverse pattern characterized older ages. The pattern was more
typical of Jewish males, however, than
of females, whose mortality quite
closely resembled that of non-Jewish
women. These studies all indicated that
the survival of the Jews to older ages
reflected a substantially lower rate of infant mortality and a relatively lower incidence of the infectious diseases fatal to
younger persons. As a result, relatively
more Jews lived to those ages plagued
by the chronic diseases.

The present study explores mortality
patterns of the Jews of Rhode Island
during 1979-81 and compares them to
those for the state’s entire white population in 1980 and, on a limited basis, to

patterns of Jewish mortality identified
for 1962-64. Some attention will also be
given to differentials within the Jewish
group as they are related to place of
birth and socioeconomic status.

The state’s approximately 18,000
Jews are concentrated in the Providence
metropolitan area, with smaller concentrations in a few outlying cities. Although they trace their origins largely to
Eastern Europe, the majority of Rhode
Island Jews are native-born. The
foreign-born are primarily in the older
age groups, with a small number being
recent, younger, Russian immigrants.
Like Jews elsewhere in the United
States, those in Rhode Island are characterized by very low fertility levels,
generally high educational achievement, and white-collar occupations. No
comprehensive demographic study of
the Jewish community of Rhode Island
has been undertaken since 1963 (Goldstein, 1964). Indirect evidence, however, indicates that since then the demographic changes that have occurred
within the Rhode Island Jewish community include a drop in the birth rate, redistribution within the state, and considerable out-migration. Unpublished data
(Aronson, 1985) indicate, for example,
that of Jewish funerals conducted in
Rhode Island, the percentage accounted for by persons living outside the
state has risen from 12 per cent in 1964—
68 to 16 per cent in 1979-83. This change
suggests that the elderly are among
those likely to have moved out. As a
result of these changes and in the absence of a reliable study since 1963 of
Rhode Island’s Jewish population, no
valid basis exists for computing mortality rates. Nonetheless, data on Jewish
deaths, when compared to those of the
State’s total population, can provide important insights on differential mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In the absence of official vital statistics by religion, scholars focusing on
Jews have been aided by the fact that in
many cities Jewish decedents are likely
to be handled by a limited number of funeral directors and interred in specific
cemeteries. Lists provided by funeral directors who handle Jewish deaths can
thereby identify Jewish deaths in a given
locality (see, e.g., Seidman, 1962;
Gorwitz, 1962; Goldstein, 1966). The
current study has taken a slightly different approach. The Jewish community of
Rhode Island is serviced by a weekly
newspaper which routinely includes
obituaries of interest to local Jewry, as
provided by funeral directors or families
of the deceased. These obituaries were
monitored for three years, from January
1979 through December 1981. Names
were culled of all Jewish deaths occurring in Rhode Island or to Rhode Island
residents who happened to be out of the
state at the time of their death. Excluded from our roster were deaths of
former Rhode Island residents whose
obituaries were included in the newspaper because they were still of some local
interest. Information about the decedent abstracted from the obituaries included name, age, sex, date of death,
usual address, place of birth, labor force
status, and occupation if employed at
time of death, or usual occupation. This
procedure resulted in a file of 636
names. This roster was augmented by
the addition of 99 deaths obtained
through checks with those institutions in
the state, including synagogues, that
handled Jewish deaths. A total of 735
Jewish deaths were thus identified as
having occurred to Jewish residents of
Rhode Island during 1979-81. Since almost no Jewish deaths in Rhode Island
are handled by anyone other than the in

stitutions contacted, we estimate virtually complete coverage of Jewish deaths
during the period.

Each of the names was then checked
in the death records maintained by the

Rhode Island Registry of Vital Statis
tics. The information obtained from the
published obituaries and additional listings was cross-checked for accuracy and
augmented when necessary. Additional
data abstracted from the death certificates included marital status at time of
death and causes of death as coded on
the death certificate.

The analysis which follows examines
the characteristics of the Jewish decedents, including age, sex, place of birth,
and socioeconomic status as defined by
occupation. Whenever possible, comparison will be made with the total white
population of Rhode Island. Because
only 735 deaths, about evenly divided
between men and women, were identified for the three-year period, only a
limited number of controls can be introduced at any one time; and since most of
the Jewish deaths were to men and
women over age 45, only very limited
analysis of deaths to younger persons

was undertaken. Since rates cannot be
calculated for the Jewish population in
general, comparisons with non-Jews
must be restricted to differential distributions by age.

Age at death. Previous research has
indicated more favorable death rates
among Jews compared to non-Jews at
younger ages, and the reverse pattern at
older ages. The data available for
Rhode Island Jews for 1979-81 (Table
1) conform to the expected patterns for
both men and women. For example,
among men, a significantly lower percentage of deaths occurred to Jews under age 65 (20.3 per cent) than to nonJews (34.6 per cent). The differential
was reversed for each of the higher age
groups of men; Jewish women had
slightly lower mortality at ages 65~74
and 85 and over. For both sexes, median
age at death is higher for Jews than for
total whites, by 3.6 years for men and
3.2 years for women.

Without information on the Jewish
base population, it is not possible to determine how much of the difference in
distribution by age at death is due to differences in the age distribution of the respective populations. A number of indicators suggest that the age distribution
of the Jewish population is more heavily
skewed toward the older ages than is
that of the total population (Goldstein,
1964). Nonetheless, the earlier noted
pattern of greater concentration of Jewish deaths among the older population is
strong enough and consistent enough
with earlier findings to suggest that it
would remain even when expressed in
terms of rates, although the absolute differences may be somewhat less.

With general improvements in health
care and with the greater similarity of
life styles among Jews and non-Jews,
these differences in age at death are
likely to disappear with time (cf. Goldstein, 1981, p. 11). That this does not appear to have occurred yet may reflect a
number of differences that still characterize the two populations. Jews may
still differ in their socioeconomic status
and life styles, and in their access to and
utilization of health services. The proportion foreign-born in the two populations may affect mortality levels (Rhode
Island has seen a considerable influx of
immigrants from Latin America during
the 1970’s, and these persons are classified as ‘‘white’’); and the genetic
make-up of the two groups, as it relates
to resistance to certain diseases, may
differ. Information on these variables is
not available in the published vital statistics. Some limited information is obtainable directly from the death certificate, however, on birthplace and occupation, and this has been abstracted for
the Jews. :

Place of birth.—Like many East

Social Biology

Coast cities, Providence received a
heavy influx of Jewish immigrants between 1880 and 1920, especially from
Eastern Europe. By 1980, however, the
Jewish community was constituted
largely of native-born persons, and the
foreign-born who remained were concentrated in the older ages (Goldstein
and Goldscheider, 1968, pp. 41-43).
This situation is clearly reflected in the
distribution of deaths by place of birth
and age.

Foreign-born deaths occurred heavily among those over 75 years of age,
and the distributions by age were very
similar for men and women (Table 2).
Deaths to native-born Jews were more
widely distributed by age, with one

quarter occurring to persons under age
65. Sex differentials in age at death are
also much more pronounced among the
native-born than the foreign-born.
Among the native-born men, 8 per cent
died before age 45, compared to only 3
per cent of the women. At the other end
of the age scale, just under half the
deaths to women were at ages 75 and
over, but only 30 per cent of the male
deaths occurred at these late ages.
Reflecting these patterns, median age at
death for the native born was much
younger than for foreign born, and the
median for female natives was four
years higher than for male natives.
These age-sex differentials by placeof-birth status may in part reflect the differential composition of the native- and
foreign-born Jews. Since the nativeborn are more evenly distributed among
the various age groups, one would expect a comparatively broader distribution of deaths as well and a general
reflection of sex differentials in age at
death. On the other hand, the foreignborn Jews living in Rhode Island are
largely the “survivors” of a group who
arrived in the state in the early decades
of the twentieth century. Therefore,
deaths to the foreign-born in 1979-81
are necessarily concentrated in the older
ages. Such concentration is likely to
lessen sex differential mortality. As the
foreign-born become an increasingly
smaller segment of the total Jewish population, the age distribution of Jewish
deaths can be expected to resemble that
of the total white population much more
closely, among whom a relatively
smaller proportion are foreign born.
Socioeconomic status.—Socioeconomic status (SES) has an important
bearing on health in general and on access to medical care (cf. Kitagawa and
Hauser, 1973, pp. 87-110), and there

fore on patterns of mortality. In the absence of any single comprehensive index
of socioeconomic status, education and/
or occupation are often used as indicators, although the shortcomings of these
measures are recognized (Therriault
and Logrillo, 1982). The present study
had to rely on current or usual occupation as the sole indicator of SES, because the Rhode Island death certificate
does not contain information on the educational achievement of decedents.
Information recorded on death certificates about occupation and, to a
lesser extent, labor force status, may be
of variable accuracy for a number of reasons. Problems arise primarily because
the information is provided by relatives
or acquaintances rather than the individual concerned, and these informants
may not be entirely certain of the usual
occupation of the decedent or of labor
force status. Additionally, the information on occupation may be gathered in
terms of either usual occupation or occupation at time of death; the latter may
differ from usual occupation among
older persons who have taken a second
job after initial retirement. Assessment
of this situation was undertaken using
data from a sample of the total Rhade
Island population (Gute and Fulton,
1982; Fulton and Gute, 1983), which
compared the information on the broad
census categories of occupation recorded on death certificates with that
gathered from a sample survey and that
contained in city directories. The results
indicated disagreement between the
death certificate occupation and that
from other sources for about one-third
of the men. For women, the discrepancies were much higher when an occupation other than “housewife”’ was listed,
but the listing of “housewife” per se appears to be a good indicator of lifetime

occupational activity. Assuming these
limitations apply equally to the death
certificate information for Jews, they
preclude any definitive assessment of
the effect of occupational differentials,
and of SES as indicated by occupation
on mortality levels. Nonetheless, some
broad patterns may be identified.

Of the 379 male decedents, only onefourth were employed at the time of
their death. Most of the remainder had
been retired. Among the women decedents, two-thirds were identified as
homemakers at time of death, onefourth as being retired, and only 5 per
cent as being in the labor force. These
patterns are not surprising in view of the
age distribution at death. They do, however, mean that information on occupation can be only suggestive, at best.

A number of studies have documented that American Jews in the midtwentieth century are overwhelmingly
employed in white-collar positions
(Goldstein, 1981, pp. 51-56), and that
within the broad white-collar category,
large proportions are professionals or
managers/proprietors. These occupational concentrations are reflected in the

Social Biology

data on the Jewish decedents. Only 15
per cent of the male decedents were reported to have been employed in bluecollar work; an almost equal percentage
had been professionals, and almost half
were identified as managers or proprietors. Of the women decedents with a
listed occupation, a similarly low percentage had been in blue collar jobs (18
per cent), and the largest percentage (44
per cent) had held clerical or sales positions. A much smaller percentage (26.5
per cent) of women than men had been
managers or proprietors, and 12 per
cent were identified as professionals. A
number of the 238 women with no occupation listed may also at some time in
their lives have been in the labor force,
most probably as lower white-collar or
blue collar employees.

In order to obtain some insights into
possible differentials in mortality by socloeconomic status, decedents were
classified as either higher (professionals,
managers, proprietors) or lower (all
other occupations) SES (Table 3).
Among the males, a slightly larger percentage of higher SES men died at ages
65-74 and at age 85 and over than was

true of those in the lower SES category.
More noteworthy is the significantly
larger percentage of lower SES men
dying during ages 75~84. It is this differential which largely accounts for the
substantial disparity in median age at
death between the two groups. This pattern is the reverse of earlier findings that
associate higher SES with higher living
standards and therefore better health
and longer life. Apparently, by the late
1970’s differences in SES no longer affected life styles in the same manner as
earlier. It is, in fact, quite likely that now
the stresses associated with higher SES
occupations tend to shorten life.

For the women, the small number of
cases and weaknesses in reporting occupations precludes analysis by SES status. The distribution by age at death for
those women identified as homemakers

shows the large majority (three-fourths)
dying at age 75 or later, and one-third as
surviving at least to age 85.

CAUSE OF DEATH

The foregoing discussion has suggested that Jews on the average die at
older ages than the total white population, a pattern found earlier in other
communities, including Greater Providence in the early 1960’s (Goldstein,
1966). Like the earlier report of Jewish
mortality, this study can also ascertain
major causes of death for the Rhode Island Jewish population. Comparisons
between the 1960 findings and those for
1979-81 indicate that, on the crude level
permitted by the available data (Table
4), the major causes of death—heart disease, cancer, and cerebro-vascular
disorders—remained the same for Jews

and non-Jews in both age groups and
continued to account for about threefourths of all deaths. Some shifts did occur in the relative importance of these
and other causes. The changes may,
however, in part be due to the aggregation of the data into very broad age categories and lack of distinction by sex; in
part, the differences may also reflect
changes in reporting cause of death by
the attending physicians or in coding
practices.

Cause of death by sex and age.—The
data for 1979-81 allow somewhat more
refined analysis of causes of death, controlling for age and sex. The Rhode Island death certificate provides listings of
multiple causes of death, identified as
immediate, intermediate, and underlying.! The underlying (primary) cause is
considered the official cause of death
and is the one coded and reported in the
published statistics. Since several causes
are often contributive to death, use of
one cause overly simplifies the situation.
Research has indicated, however, that
when the broad categories of underlying
cause of death are used, causes of mortality are reasonably represented (Manton and Stallard, 1984). Use of all the information provided on the death
certificate would, of course, provide a
more complete view of mortality causes,
but the underlying cause is the one used
in this study to allow comparisons between the Jewish and total white populations. Because of the very few deaths
to Jews under age 45, the analysis will
focus on deaths to persons aged 45 and
over. For efficiency of comparison, the
data for Jews have been standardized

of death are found in the Public Health Service,

for age, using total white male and female decedents as the standard.

Among Jewish males aged 45 and
over, acute myocardial infarctions
(AMJ), other heart diseases, and cancer
each account for 22 to 24 per cent of all
deaths (Table 5). No other single cause
accounts for as much as 10 per cent of
deaths. Data not shown in the table indicate that considerable variations in
these patterns exists for specific age
groups. Although AMI was the most
prominent cause of death among those
aged 45-64 (32.1 per cent), its importance declined continuously with increasing age, accounting for only 9.7 per
cent of deaths among men aged 85 and
over. Similarly, diabetes declines in importance as age at death increases, from
10.7 per cent to no reported deaths from
this cause among decedents aged 85 and
over. The reverse pattern characterizes
death from other heart diseases, which
rises from 14.3 per cent among the 4564 age group to 29.2 per cent of the oldest decedents. Cancer is an important
cause of death for each age group, but
much more so for men aged 45-74 than
for those aged 75 and over.

In general, these cause-of-death patterns characterize the total white male
decedents as well, although the levels
vary somewhat. The only significant differences in cause of death between the
two male groups are the elevated percentage of Jews reported as dying from
diabetes and the higher per cent of nonJews dying of respiratory ailments.

These differences are not readily explained by these data. Several factors
may be operating. Since diabetes may to
some extent be genetically determined,
it is not surprising that the Jews, a group
characterized by a high degree of inmarriage, should exhibit a relatively
high incidence of deaths from diabetes.

*Standardized for age 45 and over using the total white male and female decedent populations as the standard.
The proportion of Jews dying from specified cause is significantly different at the 0.05 level from that of the total whites dying

from the same cause.

The differentials in deaths from respiratory ailments may be linked to smoking
and/or work conditions. A number of
studies have found, for example, that
the lower incidence of lung cancer
among Jews is related to the fact that
cigarette smoking is less frequent among
Jews than Catholics or Protestants (e.g.,
Seidman, 1973; Herman and Enterline,
1973). On the other hand, although the
proportions of deaths due to cancer and
heart diseases appear very similar for
the two groups, these rather general categories may mask important differences
in types of cancer and heart disease.

In general, the major causes of death
account for about the same percentage
of Jewish female deaths as of males.
However, cerebro-vascular deaths are
relatively more important among
women than men, while the reverse
holds for deaths from diabetes. Deaths
from respiratory diseases are also somewhat more prevalent among Jewish
women than men. The patterns for Jewish women are remarkably similar to

those of total white women. Overall,
therefore, these data suggest that there
are important differences in cause of
death between males and females and
between Jewish males and total white
males, but that Jewish females closely
resemble total white females in distribution by cause of deaths.

Cause of death and socioeconomic
status.—Although earlier analysis has
indicated no sharp differences in distribution in age at death by socioeconomic
status for males, and for females when
homemakers are included, previous research on the general American population has suggested that SES status can be
an important factor in determining
cause of death (Kitagawa and Hauser,
1973). Because of the small number of
cases available to this study, analysis of
the relation between SES status and distribution of deaths by cause will be restricted to males, and even then, the
findings can only be viewed as suggestive.

For males, the overall patterns for

96 Goldstein

the higher and lower SES groups are
similar, and the differences narrow even
more when the data are standardized for
age (Table 6). The greatest absolute differences characterize deaths due to
AMI and cancer; each cause accounted
for a larger percentage of all deaths
among high SES than among low SES
males (for AMI, 25.0 vs. 21.8 per cent;
for cancer, 25.3 vs. 22.2 per cent). Differences in distribution vary considerably more within specific age groups, although the 45-64 age group is notable
for very little difference by SES status.
Among older ages, distributions are
quite variable but no consistent pattern
appears to help explain the differentials
for the two groups by age of death identified earlier (see Table 3). The differences between the two groups are especially pronounced among the oldest age
category. It is possible that not only occupational (SES) differentials are operating here, but also foreign-born status.
Older, lower SES males are more likely
to have been born outside the United
States than either higher SES older men
or younger men regardless of SES status. The health background of the lower
SES older men may therefore vary considerably from that of the other males
and be an important factor in differentiating them by cause of death.

Cause of death and place of birth.—
Since the foreign-born may have been
exposed to quite different health and living standards than the native-born,
place of birth status may in itself be an
important underlying variable in determining specific causes of death. For example, Russian-born (which would include a high percentage of Jews) have
been shown to be at especially high risk
for cardiovascular diseases and cancer
of the gastrointestinal tract and at low
risk for cancer of the reproductive tract

 

Social Biology

(Curtiss and Grahn, 1980: 494-495).
Among Rhode Island Jews, age-specific
cause-of-death patterns may also reflect
differences in the place-of-birth status of
persons in the various age groups.

When the data on cause of death are
tabulated separately for the native-born
and foreign-born, the age standardized
data suggest that native-born men are
somewhat more likely to die of AMI
(23.9 per cent), cancer (25.4 per cent),
and other heart diseases (25.2 per cent)
than are the foreign-born (21.8, 20.0,
and 21.7 per cent, respectively). Conversely, foreign-born males have a
higher proportion of deaths caused by
cerebro-vascular disorders and respiratory diseases. For no specific cause of
death are the differences statistically
significant. For women, the standardized data indicate a relatively higher
percentage of deaths from cancer (22.6
per cent) and a lower percentage from
respiratory ailments (2.1 per cent)
among the native-born; 18.3 per cent of
the foreign-born died of cancer and 6.7
per cent from respiratory diseases. The
significantly higher percentage of
foreign-born women who died of respiratory ailments may be the result of differences in smoking habits or differences in their environment. Many
foreign-born spent their early years in
small factories or sweat shops, which
may have impaired their respiratory systems.

Deaths from specific types of
cancer.—A number of studies (see Shiloh and Selavan, 1973) have found
lower rates of lung cancer for Jews compared to non-Jews. By contrast, studies
of differential rates of cancer of the genital organs have found few differences by
religious groups. The data for Rhode Island allow some limited assessment of
cause of death for cancer at specific sites

for the Jewish and total white population. The data for males when age is
controlled show cancer of the digestive
tract as a major cause-of-death site for
both groups, accounting for just under
one-third of all cancer. Equally important for total whites is cancer of the respiratory system, but this site is strikingly
less important (only 21.8 per cent) for
Jewish men. Conversely, Jews show
somewhat higher percentages of cancer
deaths involving the genital-urinary system (22.2 vs. 17.3 per cent), and of unspecified sites, but neither difference is
significant. Among females, the percentages dying from cancer of the respiratory system are generally similar for
Jews (8.0 per cent) and total whites
(10.6 per cent), as are the percentages
dying from cancer of the genital-urinary
system (16.3 and 14.9 per cent) and
from breast cancer (16.6 and 16.5 per
cent). The most striking difference
characterizes deaths from cancer of the
digestive system. Jewish women have a
considerably lower percentage of deaths
from cancer at this site (28.4 per cent)
than total whites (38.4 per cent).

The very large proportion of Jews
(between 23 and 31 per cent), males and
females, for whom cancer site is unspecified is puzzling and makes comparison
with the total group tentative, at best.
One possible explanation may be that
the good medical care generally utilized
by Jews is able to control to some extent
cancer at a specified site, and it is only
once the cancer has metastesized to multiple organs that it causes death. Nonetheless, it is likely that some of the differences for specific sites are large
enough and consistent enough across
age groups to reflect actual conditions.
The differences in respiratory cancer between the male groups, for example, are
large and consistently in the same

Social Biology

direction—higher for total whites than
Jews—in three of the four age groups
over 45. Moreover, the differential in
deaths due to respiratory cancer conforms to the overall pattern identified
earlier (Table 5) that death from respiratory diseases is generally lower among
Jewish men than among total white
males.

Deaths from specific types of cardiovascular diseases.—Unlike the differences between Jews and non-Jews
found for deaths due to specific cancers,
the patterns for the two groups for
deaths from various kinds of cardiovascular diseases are very similar. The similarity is especially strong for males, with
almost identical percentages of deaths
from acute myocardial infarction for the
two groups (43.5 vs. 44.1 percent), from
old myocardial infarction (28.8 and 29.8
per cent), and from cerebro-vascular
disorders (11.3 vs. 11.6 per cent). The
patterns for women are slightly varied.
Jewish women have a lower percentage
of deaths from old myocardial infarctions (27.9 per cent) than total white
women (32.1 per cent), but relatively
more deaths from other cardiovascular
diseases (19.0 and 16.7 per cent, respectively). These findings correspond to the
overall patterns of cause of death which
also indicated close similarity between
Jews and total whites in proportions
dying of cardiovascular diseases. Apparently the factors—whether environmental or genetic—which contribute to
differentials in the broad categories of
cause of death as well as in specific types
of cancer do not influence incidence of
various kinds of heart diseases.

SUMMARY

In assessing factors that influence
health and survival, the effect of religion

and ethnicity has been of some interest
because patterns of living, attitudes toward health and medical care, and genetic factors may all be related to
religious/ethnic group membership.
Such analysis is difficult, however, because Official vital records do not collect
information on religion or ethnicity. Using information provided by a newspaper and institutions handling Jewish
deaths, this study has been able to identify 735 deaths that occurred to Jewish
residents of Rhode Island during 197981. Through matching with official
death records, data were obtained on
the characteristics of the deceased and
on cause of death. Comparisons were
therefore possible of Jewish and total
white patterns of mortality and cause of
death, controlling for age and sex, and
analysis of differentials within the group
of Jewish decedents, taking account of
place of birth and occupation.

These data provide a unique opportunity to explore the patterns of death
for a single religious group. Unfortunately, lack of information on the exact
size and composition of the total Jewish
population of Rhode Island generally
precludes calculation of rates or of life
table values. Comparisons with deaths
in the total white population are therefore necessarily crude; differentials between the two groups are influenced by
differentials in the age composition of
the respective total populations. Standardization by age overcomes this limitation to some extent.

Consistent with previous research,
the current study indicates that a lower
percentage of Jewish males die at ages
below 65 and more at ages 85 and over
than is true of the total white population. By contrast, Jewish females exhibit
an age-at-death pattern similar to that of
the general population, but with a

Causes of Death Among Rhode Island Jews 99

higher percentage of Jewish women
dying between ages 75-84. These sex
differences characterize cause-of-death
patterns as well. Differences are more
pronounced between Jewish and total
white males, than between the female
groups. Restricting the analysis to persons aged 45 and over, for Jewish men,
as for total white males, heart diseases
and cancer account for almost threefourths of all deaths. Among Jews, respiratory diseases and diabetes each account for 4 per cent of all deaths over
age 45, and these percentages stand in
sharp contrast to those for total white
men. Jewish deaths from diabetes are
significantly higher and from respiratory
disease significantly lower than among
total white men. Differences between
the two groups also extend to sitespecific cancer deaths but not to specific
types of cardiovascular diseases as
causes of death. No such disparities in
causes of death are found when Jewish
females are compared to total white
women, either in terms of general
causes or for specific cancers and cardiovascular diseases.

A unique aspect of the data set being
used here is the availability of information on the socioeconomic characteristics of a large number of the Jewish decedents. Particular focus was on place of
birth (native-born/foreign-born) and socioeconomic status (high/low) as indicated by usual occupations, because
both types of characteristics are associated with differences in life styles and
therefore access to and utilization of
health services. Analysis by place of
birth suggests that observed differences
in cause of death between native-born
and foreign-born are largely a function
of their very different patterns of age at
death. Socioeconomic status (SES)
showed no clear or strong relation to

100 Goldstein

patterns of age at death or cause of
death, perhaps in part because the information on occupation is not as accurate
as desirable, especially for women. The
data do suggest, however, that higher
SES males are more likely to die of
acute myocardial infarction or cancer
than lower SES men.

The relatively few Jewish deaths
available to this study has limited the
scope of the analysis as well as affecting
the variability of the distributions.
Nonetheless, the differences identified
in age-specific patterns of death and in
cause of death indicate that religion and
ethnicity continue to influence mortality. At the same time, the present analysis suggests that in many respects, Jewish mortality very closely resembles that
of non-Jews. Whether the similarity in
mortality patterns is the result of convergence over the last several decades
cannot, however, be determined with

Social Biology

currently available data; and whether
future convergence will occur as Jewish
and non-Jewish life styles and characteristics become more nearly alike is also
open to question. The current study can
serve as a useful baseline for such extended research.
