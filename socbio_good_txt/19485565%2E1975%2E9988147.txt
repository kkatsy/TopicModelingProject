Alienation Antecedents of Unwanted

Fertility: A Longitudinal Study

H. Theodore Groat and Arthur G. Neal

Department of Sociology

Americans have today adopted a nearly
universal norm of fertility control in one
form or another (Westoff and Ryder,
1969). There has been a steady increase
in recent years in positive attitudes toward
contraceptive practice as well as in the
actual use of birth control techniques. This
increase has occurred among all segments
of the population, affecting a gradual contraction in differentials by such sociocultural categories as education and religion
(Westoff and Bumpass, 1973). Recent discussions of population policy have been
directed specifically at the implications of
this “revolution” in contraceptive behavior, especially as it may relate to the
question of unwanted fertility and, ultimately, to the rate of population growth
(see, for example, Bumpass and Westoff,
19705; Jaffe, 1971; and Commission on
Population Growth and the American Future, 1972).

Involved in any discussion of “perfect
contraceptive” populations is the dual issue
of means versus motives. The widespread
and rapid adoption of the contraceptive pill
by millions of American women has served
to focus attention on the potential efficacy
of an improved contraceptive technology
for the reduction or virtual elimination of

 

unwanted or unplanned births. Yet throughout the 1960’s, long after the ready availability of the pill and other effective means
of contraception, large numbers of American women reported unwanted births. Between 1960 and 1965, for example, 20 per
cent of all births were reported as unwanted (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970a).
Between 1965 and 1970, according to the
1970 National Fertility Study, nearly half
of all births were unplanned and fully 15
per cent were reported as never wanted
(Commission on Population Growth and
the American Future, 1972). Thus, presumably as many as 2.65 million births
over the latter five-year period would not
have occurred had couples been able to
realize their fertility preferences. We should
also bear in mind that the measures of
unwanted fertility used in making these
estimates were generally on the conservative side, due largely to the rationalization
involved in reporting unwanted births
(Bumpass and Westoff, 1970).

While Americans have overwhelmingly
adopted family planning as a prevailing
norm, the above data clearly suggest that
the efficacy of individual couples in realizing their reproductive goals is still highly
variant. In other words, the widespread

availability of highly effective contraceptives has not yet been translated into a
comparably high degree of fertility control. Thus, the question of motivation, along
with that of technological means, must be
raised as a critical issue for both research
and public policy. We know that unwanted
fertility occurs most frequently among persons with the lowest levels of education and
income, and that most unwanted fertility
occurs among women in their later years
of childbearing (Commission on Population
Growth and the American Future, 1972).
What we do not know is why these women
have such high rates of unwanted fertility
and why there is a persistent factor of
“excess” fertility even among the most
highly educated women in our society. The
present research is directed toward examining some suggestive leads for answering
these questions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Most of what we know about the incidence of unwanted fertility has been derived from responses to questions about
the circumstances of pregnancies that occurred at some point in the past. Reliable
reports are thus difficult to obtain, since the
admission of unwanted births may imply
unfavorable connotations about the parents
as well as the child. Rationalization, in
other words, is probably fairly common.

An alternative to ex post facto data collection procedures would be to ascertain
the fertility intentions of women at different parity levels and ages, including the
intention mot to have any more children,
and then to collect subsequent fertility data
as a way of measuring the efficacy of fertility control over a given period of time.?

1The best known research utilizing such a
longitudinal design is the Princeton Fertility
Study. The authors of the final volume in this
project report selected data on subsequent fertility among women who had indicated earlier
preferences for no additional children. By and

61

Such data were initially collected on a
series of fertility-related issues from a
sample of Toledo, Ohio mothers in 1963,
and subsequent data from the same sample,
on the same issues, in 1971. While the original study was not designed specifically to
measure correlates of unwanted fertility,
several dimensions of the two data sets
permit an examination of fertility control
over the eight-year interval.

The original sample for the collection of
data in 1963 was drawn from a completed
list of Toledo, Ohio women who had given
birth to a child during 1962. The questionnaires, consisting of a wide variety of attitudinal and census-type questions, were
returned by 68 per cent of the sampled
mothers. Seven hundred of these respondents were white Protestants and Catholics
and this subsample formed the basis for our
subsequent collection of data in 1971.
Through various procedures, current addresses were verified for 408 of the 1963
respondents. We were eventually successful
in obtaining follow-up data in 1971 from
336 subjects, or 82 per cent of the women
for whom current addresses could be determined. The longitudinal study, then, is
based on data collected from 47 per cent of
the respondents included in the original
1963 survey.”

. Our sampling procedure assured the inclusion of women with proven fecundity

large, however, no significant associations of fertility-planning success with personality characteristics were found. See L. L. Bumpass and C. F.
Westoff, 1970a.

2Drawing upon the 1963 data, a systematic
comparison of respondents and unlocated subjects
was made on each of the alienation, socioeconomic, and demographic variables. Of these numerous comparisons, only wife’s education and
religion were statistically differentiated at the 0.05
level. Protestants and those with less than a highschool education were somewhat over-represented
among unlocated subjects. In addition to the lack
of forwarding addresses, our impression is that
such factors as divorce, remarriage, residential dislocations through urban renewal projects, and
death were the primary conditions distinguishing
unlocated from located subjects.

and permitted a test for possible fertility
correlates operative during the childbearing years. Thus, the sample cuts across all
ages and marital durations and includes
parity levels from one to sixteen. While our
sample includes only women with proven
fecundity, we recognize that differential
subfecundity, especially among women past
age 35, may be a contributing factor to
differential fertility among our subjects.
The eight-year interval between 1963 and
1971 covers a span of mean ages for our
subjects from about 27 to 34 and thus
focuses on fertility correlates among women
in the later years of childbearing, where
the greatest incidence of unwanted fertility
occurs. Since the average marital duration
for our subjects in 1963 was about seven
years, the 1971 follow-up provides us with
subjects characterized by a mean marital
duration of between 14 and 15 years. Finally, only women with marriages uninterrupted by death or divorce between 1963
and 1971 are included in the present study.

It also seems important to note that our
sampling procedure biased our obtained
data in the direction of high fertility subjects. Women characterized by a high degree of fertility control and small families
had a lower probability of being selected
for our initial study. By using the 1963
respondents as the sample base for our
present research, a greater range of fertility variation is thereby obtained. Women
who have exhibited a high degree of fertility
control and successfully terminated their
childbearing, as well as women who have
experienced continued fertility beyond the
age and marital duration of completed family size for most women, are included in
the 1971 data.

RESULTS
We have listed data on a series of fertility and attitudinal variables by religion,
education, and occupation, shown in Table

Social Biology

1. These data provide an overview of the
obtained differentials by several customary
sociocultural categories and indicate the
generally high fertility of our particular
sample. The differentials by mean number
of children born between 1963 and 1971,
as well as average family size in 1971, are
in the usual and expected directions.
Nonetheless, the differentials by most recent
fertility (1963-71) are much smaller than
those by overall fertility in 1971, reflecting
the decreasing rate of childbearing which
accompanies the increasing age and marital
duration of our subjects.

The data on reported ideal family size
in 1963 and 1971 show that by 1971 the
women in our sample have invariably exceeded their own notions of what constitutes an ideal family size. Moreover, while
their fertility continued to increase between
1963 and 1971, the reported ideal family
size was drastically reduced over this same
time period. Other research has suggested
that the use of ideal family size as a basis
for determining unwanted fertility tends to
be a conservative criterion, since ideal family size generally exceeds the number of
children subjects desire for themselves or
that they intend to have (Ryder and Westoff, 1969). To the extent that such relationships between ideal, desired, and intended
fertility are applicable to our subjects, the
striking disparities between ideal and actual
fertility in 1971, shown in Table 1, are indicative of a significant incidence of unplanned and unwanted fertility. We shall
return to this point in subsequent tables.

If unwanted fertility does indeed constitute an important amount of the overall
fertility for our sample, it seems unlikely
that it is due to unfavorable attitudes toward family planning. Regardless of religion, education, or occupational status,
roughly 90 per cent of our respondents
reported approval of doing something to
limit the number and spacing of preg

nancies. However, the data on use of birth
control before the first pregnancy, and on
regular use of contraception, provide much
sharper differentials by the sociocultural
categories. Catholics, women with the least
education, and women married to husbands
in manual occupations all reported less use
of birth control before the first pregnancy
and less regular use overall than did Protestants, more highly educated women, and
women married to men in nonmanual occupations.

Accidental pregnancies (defined as pregnancies which began “while using some
method to prevent pregnancy”) were reported by about 35 per cent of our sample,
and with the exception of college-educated
women there is little difference between the
percentages by religion, education, or occupation. However, somewhat greater differentials are obtained within these same
categories in the percentages of women reporting they really wanted their last child.
The range of percentages within the education category, from only 56 per cent for
grade school wives to 73 per cent for col
lege-educated women, is particularly striking.

In summary, Table 1 shows a concomitant pattern of increasing fertility and decreasing ideal family size between 1963 and
1971 for women in our sample. We also see
a uniformly high acceptance of contraceptive use coupled with relatively low percentages of actual use on a regular basis.
Nearly 35 per cent of the women reported
accidental pregnancies while using some
method to prevent pregnancy, and considerably less than three-fourths of our sample
reported really wanting their last child, regardless of parity. Subsequent tables are
directed at providing us with insights into
selected socio-psychological correlates of the
family-forming process, with special attention to the issue of unwanted fertility.

Several recent studies have indicated the
potential relevancy of alienation theory to
fertility and family planning behavior. The
alienation dimensions of meaninglessness,
normlessness, powerlessness, and social isolation have been found to differentiate such
variables as age at marriage and family

size (Groat and Neal, 1967, 1973; Neal
and Groat, 1970), contraceptive practice
(Bauman and Udry, 1972), and planning
for the last child (Bullough, 1972). Rainwater (1960) was the first to elaborate a
broad, though implicit, perspective of
alienation theory at it may relate to fertility
behavior. For example, he emphasized that
many women may in a sense be “victimized” by a high fertility which stems
from particular combinations of perceptions
and motivations. Thus, highly alienated
women may be less successful in controlling their fertility, and larger families
may be due in part to unplanned and unwanted pregnancies generated by a life-style
of aimlessness and drift. In other words,
some minimal sense of stability and trust
in the predictability of future events seems
essential to consistent and effective family
planning. The kind of world view implied
by this rationale is precisely what is most
lacking among highly alienated persons.
Seeman’s (1959) well-known definition
of alienation has emphasized the multidimensionality of the concept into attitude
clusters. Thus, meaninglessness (perceived
complexity and chaos), powerlessness (subjectively-held probabilities for controlling
events), normlessness (perceived necessity
of socially disapproved conduct for goal
attainment), and social isolation (the experience of social cleavage) have been
operationalized as separate alienation dimensions.® Using these multiple indicators
of alienation, previously reported findings
(Groat and Neal, 1967) provided general

3 Each of the four alienation scales was organized in a Likert format and contained empirical
referents to events in the broader society. None
of the items contained specific referents to alienation within the family. The powerlessness, meaninglessness, and normlessness scales particularly
emphasized the themes of alienation in connection
with political and economic events. The isolation
scale concentrated on feeling of impersonality and
loneliness in relations with others. Copies of the
scales are available upon request.

Social Biology

support for the view that conditions of
alienation are associated with variations in
family size. Subsequently, by means of
scalogram analysis (Stouffer et al., 1952),
it was possible for us to construct empirical
profiles of alienation by drawing upon the
multiple scores derivable from the individual powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, and social isolation scales. The
results of this procedure yielded even better predictive results than those obtained
by use of the separate dimensions alone
(Neal and Groat, 1970; Groat and Neal,
1973).

Table 2 shows the separate alienation
profiles, constructed from 1963 alienation
scores, for Protestants and Catholics. The
separation of subjects by religion was made,
first, because the specific relationships between kinds of alienation and fertility
varied by religion; and secondly, because
the interrelationships of alienation components were varied between Protestants
and Catholics. Thus, an identifiable basis
for unity across alienation scales is a
function of the cohesion among variables
in the specific populations being studied.
Since social isolation among Catholics was
related to fertility in an anomalous pattern
by comparison with other variables, it was
obviously tapping a separate aspect of the
alienation problem. For this reason, isolation was eliminated from our scalogram
analysis of Catholic subjects.

Table 2 shows that each of our three
fertility measures relates to alienation profiles in the expected direction. Whether we
use the mean number of children over @
common time interval (1963 to 1971), the
total number of children in 1971, or the
extreme case of having five or more children, the results generally indicate that the
higher the level of alienation, the higher
the level of fertility. This finding applies
to Catholics as well as to Protestants. For
example, beween 1963 and 1971, Protes

tants with the highest alienation profiles
had, on the average, 1.12 children, in
contrast to only 0.65 children for their lowalienation Protestant counterparts. Similar
results are obtained for the Catholic sample. These differences by alienation profiles
within religious categories, whether in terms
of 1963-71 or total fertility, are nearly as
great, or greater, than the differentials obtained defween religious, educational, and
occupational categories shown in Table 1.

In Table 2, the data show that between
1963 and 1971, when fertility was still increasing, the proportions of both Protestants and Catholics who regarded five or
more children as ideal tended to decline.
The gaps between ideal and actual fertility
are quite large for all women in our high
fertility sample, though the disparities appear most striking among the most highly
alienated respondents. When we consider
mean age and marital duration, also listed
by alienation profiles, the inferences become
somewhat more clear. The most highly
alienated women (Protestant and Catholic)
are on the average younger, married earlier,
and have a shorter marital duration than
the women low in alienation. Thus, the potential for additional fertility, wanted or
unwanted, is greatest for precisely those
women who already have the highest fertility, that is, the highly alienated women
in profiles 3 and 2.

The excess of fertility over ideal family
size by 1971 is indicative of problems in
fertility control for both Protestant and
Catholic subjects. It may be, however, that
the result of excess fertility by the time of
the last child is in part determined by the
delayed use of contraception during the
early years of married life. The data on
the timing of first contraceptive use and
the status of the last child by alienation
profiles suggest that this may be the case.
Among Protestants, the decreasing ratio of
contraceptive use before the first pregnancy

Social Biology

was correspondingly related to increases in
alienation scores (Chi square = 10.19, significant at less than the 0.02 level). However, early use of contraception among
Catholics by alienation scores failed to
reach statistical significance, which may be
due to the as yet undetermined relationship
among Catholics to nonconformity with
church doctrine on contraceptive usage.
The more highly alienated Catholics were
characterized by a somewhat greater incidence of unwanted fertility at last parity.

The relatively small sample size with
which we must work makes difficult simultaneous controls by religion and socioeconomic status. Therefore, Table 3 was
prepared to suggest the extent to which
our alienation-fertility relationships may be
spuriously caused by associations between
fertility behavior and socioeconomic indicators.

Whether by husband’s occupation or
wife’s education, and with religion controlled, the data in Table 3 show striking
and significant fertility differentials by high
and low alienation. In the interest of economy and to sustain adequate numbers for
our cells under controlled conditions, we
have dichotomized the alienation profiles
into high (3, 2) and low (1, 0). Women
scoring high in alienation in 1963, regardless of religion or occupation and education
categories, show a consistent pattern of
higher subsequent fertility than their lowalienation counterparts. Considering that
these fertility measures are only for births
between 1963 and 1971, the differences are
quite large indeed. Thus, the alienation
profiles successfully differentiate levels of
fertility among the women in our sample
regardless of occupational or educational
status and seem to be tapping dimensions of
fertility behavior that have an independence
of their own.

family size at that time. By determining
subsequent childbearing for those who indicated in 1963 that “my family is just
about the right size,” we are provided with
an additional indicator of unsuccessful fertility control. We recognize that this measure of fertility intentions is indirect and
that some women may simply have changed
their minds at a later point in time. Nonetheless, by concentrating on women who
reported family size in 1963 as “about
right,” we may draw some cautious inferences, especially since the results corroborate those obtained by dealing with
ideal family size. These data are shown in
Table 4 for both Protestants and Catholics
and suggest the importance of alienation
profiles in accounting for excess fertility.
Table 4 indicates that among both Protestants and Catholics those mothers who
scored highest in 1963 alienation had the
greatest amount of additional fertility over
the next eight years. Thus, while a factor
of “unwanted” fertility is undoubtedly
present among both high and low alienation

women, the probabilities of having additional children were considerably greater
for high than for low alienation subjects.
The data on age and marital duration suggest that these fertility differences are not
due to demographic factors alone.

Consistent with the general trend of our
data, the ideal family size for this subsample sharply declined between 1963 and
1971. Disparities between actual and ideal
family size in 1971, however, are greater
for women in the high than in the low
alienation profiles, among both Protestants
and Catholics. The maximum obtained disparity between actual parity and ideal family size is for Catholics high in alienation.
Catholics who regarded their families as
“just about the right size” in 1963 and who
scored high on alienation profiles were
characterized by an actual parity of 5.64
children in 1971 in contrast to an ideal
family size of 3.50. In this special case,
the excess of fertility over ideal family size
was an average of 2.14 children.

differences by alienation in “ever use” and
“regular use” of birth control are in the
expected direction, though not very great.
However, the timing of first contraceptive
use is quite different by alienation scores
among Protestant women (Phi = 0.26, significant at the 0.01 level), though not
among Catholics. Finally, about 40 per cent
of the subjects included in Table 4, regardless of alienation level, reported an accidental pregnancy while using birth control
of some kind. Therefore, it would seem
that differences in fertility control by high
and low alienation are more closely related
to the timing and regularity of use of contraception than to contraceptive failure by
itself.

We also asked our subjects in 1963, “Do
you want to have another child?” The response format read “yes,” “no,” and “undecided.”” By combining the “undecided”
and “no” categories to inflate the sample
size, we have another possible measure of
family planning efficacy. These data are
listed separately, by religion, in Tables 5

and 6. And while the numbers are admittedly quite small, the results seem provocative and important enough to present
in tabular form.

The alienation profiles clearly differentiate the fertility behavior of these women
over an eight-year time interval. Among
Protestants (Table 5), subjects in the
highest alienation profile had a subsequent
fertility more than three times as great as
women with the lowest level of alienation,
even though they were younger and had
been married for a shorter period of time.

In addition, while average ideal family
size decreased considerably for women at all
levels of alienation, those in the highest
profiles (3, 2) show the greatest excess of
actual over ideal fertility in 1971. In fact,
Protestant women with the highest level of
alienation show over the eight-year interval
both the greatest increase in fertility and
the greatest decrease in ideal family size.
We believe this inconsistency reflects a serious problem of fertility control for women
in this category. The data on contraceptive

measures. This finding suggests again that
timing of contraceptive use rather than
contraceptive failure itself is most responsible for fertility differences by levels of
alienation. In other words, the highly alienated women may be as successful with contraception as those low in alienation, when
in fact they are wsing contraception. But
regularity of use, and especially timing of
use, are different matters. Looking at the
differences by alienation in number of pregnancies after which birth control was first
practiced is quite revealing. Protestant
mothers in the highest alienation category
began using birth control after an average
of almost two and a half children, in contrast with averages of 1.35, 1.06, and 1.12
children for women in each of the three
successive profiles, respectively.
Comparable data for the Catholics in
our sample are given in Table 6, and the
overall pattern is similar to that for Protestants. The subsequent fertility of Catholic
women who in 1963 were either undecided
or did not want additional children is
clearly differentiated by the alienation profiles. The most highly alienated Catholics,
for example, had nearly twice as many
children over the eight-year interval as
women in the lowest alienation profiles
(0.92 versus 0.50, respectively). Total fertility in 1971 follows a slightly more irregular pattern. While women in the three
highest alienation profiles have average
family sizes of 6.15, 5.22, and 4.65, respectively, the least alienated women have a
mean family size of 5.50. This departure
from the hypothesized pattern is probably
due to the tendencies of middle-class, welleducated Catholic women to exhibit higher
fertility and greater conformity to church
norms on contraception than do their less
well-educated counterparts. That is, to the
extent that these low-alienation Catholics
are middle-class (see Table 3), the data in
Table 6 probably reflect the usual U-shaped

 

Social Biology

pattern of fertility often reported for Catholics by socioeconomic indicators.

In addition, and more important to our
inferences about unwanted fertility, the
data on age and marital duration suggest
that the most highly alienated Catholics
also have the greatest probabilities for additional fertility. While the data do not
form a consistent pattern across the alienation profiles, the extremes do show that
women high in alienation are younger and
have been married a shorter time than
women low in alienation.

Like Protestants, Catholic women reported much lower ideal family sizes in
1971 than in 1963. But unlike Protestant
wives, the least alienated Catholics reported
the highest average ideal family size in
both years. Nonetheless, the greatest disparities between actual and ideal fertility
are found in the two highest ‘profiles, where
actual 1971 fertility exceeds 1971 ideal
family size by 2.39 and 1.68 children in
profiles 3 and 2, respectively.

The data on contraceptive use are somewhat anomalous. All of the low-alienated
Catholics reported some use of birth control, but not very regularly and not, as a
group, before the first pregnancy. And there
are virtually no differences by alienation in
the reported incidence of accidental pregnancy while using some method of birth
control. However, the ¢iming of contraceptive use, shown by the data on mean number of pregnancies after which birth control
was first practiced, is indeed differentiated
by the alienation profiles. Women in the
two highest profiles (3, 2) show initial birth
control use only after 3.69 and 3.19 pregnancies, respectively, in contrast to 2.81
and 3.27 pregnancies for the low-alienation
women, Again, the lowest alienation profile
indicates a reversal of the overall pattern.

The 130 women, taken alone, who reported in 1963 that they wanted no more
children constitute an additional and more

conservative basis for testing our hypothesis
regarding unwanted fertility. Table 7 lists
four separate measures of subsequent fertility, by each of the alienation profiles, for
Protestants and Catholics separately. Looking at Protestants first, we note that
whether by percentages with two or more
or one or more children, the alienation profiles uniformly discriminate subsequent fertility in the expected direction. The pattern
for Catholics is approximately the same,
although no important differentials are obtained for the highest fertility category
(two or more children). For both religious
groups, however, percentages of women
with no additional children and average
number of children since 1963 follow the
hypothesized pattern. That is, women low
in alienation in 1963 were considerably
more successful in controlling their subsequent fertility than were women in the
higher alienation categories.

Finally, Table 7 also lists data which
permit review of another potentially important consideration in fertility research.
In Rainwater’s discussion (1960, pp. 167—
168) of working class fertility, he emphasizes the effect on fertility of the relatively
stable and enduring quality of world views
which “do not admit such foreign elements
as conscious planning and emotion laden
contraceptive practices.” To partially test
this notion, again using only women who
specifically indicated in 1963 that they
wanted no more children, we divided our
subjects with stable alienation scores over
the eight-year time interval by levels of
alienation into stable high and stable low
groups. Women with high alienation scores
in both 1963 and 1971 should, by our hypothesis, be characterized by a higher incidence of unwanted pregnancy than those
who scored low in alienation at both points
in time.

The data in Table 7 provide very strong
support for this hypothesis. By each of

 

71

several measures of subsequent fertility,
and for each of the separate dimensions of
alienation within the religion categories, we
find that women consistently low in alienation over a period of eight years experienced
the greatest degree of family planning efficacy. By contrast, the fertility of women
with high alienation scores at the two points
in time (stable high) invariably experienced
higher subsequent fertility. Overall, the
1963-71 fertility of the high alienation
women is well over twice as high as that
for women with consistently low alienation
scores. And, we should reiterate, all women
in this sample expressed the indentical intention in 1963 of having no additional children. Thus, Rainwater may well be correct
in arguing that high fertility, and particularly unwanted fertility, partially derives
from alienated aspects of a relatively consistent and deeply-imbedded world view.

DISCUSSION

As we have operationalized our alienation variables, the relationships between
high alienation and high fertility should by
the theory under review be understood as
a differential capacity for control-relevant
behavior of many kinds. Essentially, our
interest has been to identify social-psychological variables empirically correlated with
information-retention, planning, and the
recognition of future consequences of conduct. Considerable research has pointed to
alienation dimensions as key factors in understanding variations among populations
in their potentials for long-range planning
and in their capacities for producing the
kinds of outcomes they desire for themselves and for others.

Specifically, women high in alienation
may in a sense be victimized by a higher
probability of having unwanted pregnancies
than women low in alienation. From this
perspective, high alienation may be concomitant with “a sense of [at most] going

through the motions of family planning
with a rather low confidence that one’s
ability will suffice to achieve the desired
goal and a tendency therefore not to be particularly involved in the mechanisms of family planning” (Rainwater, 1965, p. 289).
In other words, high alienation, in its separate and combined aspects, may constitute
a highly salient social-psychological obstacle
of the probability of acting with confidence
in the emotionally charged area of fertility
and family planning behavior. Hence, the
major control-relevant implication is that
ineffective family planning may derive not
only from lack of knowledge or of access
to methods, but also from the social-psychological inaccessibility of “knowledge,”
generating a dominance of emotional over
rational elements in the decision-making
process.

Alienation in the form of meaninglessness,
for example, may direct attention from the
kinds of information that are necessary for
making events intelligible and coherent.
Similarly, the detachment and anonymity in
feelings of social isolation may create barriers to forming the very kinds of social
relations supportive of information transmission and retention. There is, of course,
no reason why high alienation should be
the exclusive characteristic of any given
social class level. However, the fact that a
higher proportion of working class than of
middle class wives do in fact fall into the
high alienation categories (see Table 3)
suggests some interesting speculations on
the relationships between class position,
alienation, and such control-relevant variables as timing of contraceptive use and unwanted pregnancies.

There is no compelling reason to assume
that our highly alienated subjects actually
want more children than women low in
alienation. In fact, our data on 1963 fertility intentions, coupled with data on ideal
family size and actual fertility in 1971,

 

73

strongly indicate a marked divergence
among highly-alienated mothers between
their behavioral norms and their fertility
values and preferences. That we find a disproportionate number of high-alienation
women in the working class category (low
education and manual occupation) corroborates recent research on unwanted
births more generally. Bumpass and Westoff (1970) have shown that the incidence
of unwanted births is inversely related to
social class indicators. Wives with less than
a high-school education, for example, have
twice the proportion of unwanted births as
women with some college education. Similar findings were reported by income.
While our present sample is not large
enough for more refined tests, the data
point toward a coincidence of working class,
high alienation, and high fertility. If high
alienation is in fact one of the cultural
mechanisms linking working class membership to a high incidence of unwanted fertility, as our data suggest, we need to know
the extent to which high alienation may
represent a persisting life-style that will
continue to interfere with birth control
efficacy. It is possible, of course, that high
alienation may be a temporary situational
response to a future perceived as confused
and uncertain. Thus, the stability of alienation levels through time becomes a crucial
research question in its own right. Do
alienative world views have persistence and
stability over a period of years, thus constituting a motivational base for a life-style
of aimlessness and drift? Or, are alienation perspectives more situational, depending upon an immediate set of conditions
which may or may not persist? In the
latter instance, we would expect given
levels of alienation to change as situations
change or disappear. If high alienation is in
fact derived from adaptation to an enduring set of conditions, we need to know at
what point, and how, such internalized

perspectives take on stability as a generalized view of the world or as a “culture
of alienation.”
