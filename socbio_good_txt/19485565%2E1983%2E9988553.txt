ABSTRACT: Cohort approach is used to disentangle age, period, and cohort effects on maternal
mortality in New York State. By comparing various age * period * cohort linear logit models on
the logits of maternal! mortality rates, we conclude that period and age effects are the dominant
influences on maternal mortality, and cohort effect does not contribute as much as we expect
after adjustment for age and period. The implications are that, as a set, changes in those temporal variables which cut across cohorts appear to be more important than changes in those varia
bles which distinguish them.

The risk of maternal mortality has
undergone a most remarkable transformation within the lifetime of most
Americans. From 1917 to 1977 maternal
mortality dropped almost 99 per cent,
exceeding the large decrease in the
death rate at all ages from infectious diseases. During this period, the chance of
a pregnant woman dying from pregnancy-related causes went approximately
from one in 108 to one in 8,900. Maternai deaths accounted for 12 per cent of
all deaths among women of childbearing
age in 1917 and less than 1 per cent sixty
years later (U.S. NCHS Vital Statistics
reports).

Given the extremely rapid decline in
maternal mortality which took place between 1917 and 1977, one would wonder
if age patterns of maternal mortality respond only to period influences, so that
the experience of a cohort can be described completely by age effects and
the effects of the periods its members
live through, or if they respond to additional cohort influences as well. This pa
per attempts to apply cohort approach
to offer answers to the underlying motivating question: Did cohort effect apply
to maternal mortality during the period
1917-77? It is our intention to disentangle age, period, and cohort effects on
maternal mortality. After comparing
models for age, period, and cohort effects, we discuss our interpretation.
New York State was selected for two
reasons: First, the requisite data on live
births and maternal deaths are available
since 1917; second, from 1917 to 1956,
there were striking downturns in maternal mortality rates both in New York
and in the United States generally (see
Figure 1). The maternal mortality rates
in New York tended to parallel those for
the nation and were consistently lower
than U.S. rates during this period.
However, in 1957, the rate in New York
State fell not as rapidly as in the nation
and even come to be slightly higher than
the U.S. rate. This reversed parallel
trend between New York State and
U.S. rates continued until 1972. Thus,

while the pattern of maternal mortality
in New York State resembled that of the
nation from 1917 to 1977, the rates in
New York State fell considerably slower
than the national rates since 1957. With
this unique trend in maternal mortality,
New York as a case study perhaps provides an opportunity to understand age,
period, and cohort patterns of maternal

 

mortality which might be different from
previous research reported in the literature.

The relationship between age, parity,
and maternal mortality, and the ways in
which differences among cohorts in

their age and parity distributions of birth
can be expected to affect their maternal
mortality rates, has been investigated by
Berry (1977). These two influences on
maternal mortality can be referred to as
age and cohort effects respectively. Period effects refer to the influence of historical events.

Berry (1976) indicated that ‘‘age or
aging effect refers to the influence of the
biological process of aging and/or to the
movement through the age-graded social statuses of the life cycle. Period or
historical change effects refer to the impact of historical events which occur at a
certain point in time. Cohort or birth cohort membership effects refer to the influences of the differing sets of past experience which characterize different
cohorts. Cohort effects are interaction
between the impact of historical or environmental events and the age of the persons experiencing these events.”

Even though age, period, and cohort
effects often have separate influences on
period rates, period approach cannot
sort the influence of one effect from that
of another. Cohort analysis can, under
certain conditions, provide separate
measure of age, period, and cohort effects.-‘Several mathematical techniques
for obtaining these measures have been
developed in the literature of cohort
analysis (Blanchard, et al., 1977; Fienberg, et al., 1978; Glenn, 1977; Mason,
et al., 1973; Palmore, 1978; Pullum,
1977, 1980; Schaie, 1965; Price, 1974).
The measurement of period effects is
not too difficult since they have strong
influences on maternal mortality. The
measurement of cohort effects is more
problematic since very large pertod influences tend to mask whatever cohort
may be present. In comparison to period and age effects on maternal mortal

ity, cohort effects are probably very
small (Berry, 1977).

MEASUREMENT OF MATERNAL
MORTALITY

Conventionally, the maternal mortality rate is defined as the number of
deaths due to puerperal causes per
10,000 or 100,000 live births. A maternal mortality rate represents approximately the risk of dying as a result of
“complications of pregnancy, childbirth
and the puerperium” (Shryock and
Siegel. 1973). The most common puerperal causes of death are infection, hemorrhage, and toxemia. According to
Berry (1976), ‘“‘puerperal causes of
death generally are subdivided into direct and indirect causes. Direct causes
are produced solely by the experience of
pregnancy and childbirth, e.g., hemmorrhage or infection. Indirect causes
of maternal deaths are preexisting conditions, e.g., heart disease, diabetes,
kidney disease, which would probably
not have proved fatal without the additional stress imposed by pregnancy and
childbirth.”

The maternal mortality computed by
the above definition is only a rough measure of the puerperal risk, since the
deaths are related to live births instead
of pregnancies, for which data are not
usually available (Spiegelman, 1968). A
true rate of maternal mortality would be
defined in terms of total pregnancies
(i.e., denominator) regardless of gestation age. This definition theoretically
would result in a maternal mortality rate
one-fifth below the rate usually determined. However, since reporting of fetal deaths in most vital statistics is restricted to pregnancies of twenty weeks
gestation or more, and fetal deaths that
occur below twenty weeks gestation are

Vol. 30, No. 4

grossly underreported in vital statistics,
national rates based on all reported
pregnancy terminations would be indistinguishable from the customary rate
(Shapiro et al., 1968).

The maternal mortality rate can be
interpreted as the probability that pregnancy will result in the mother’s death.
In this paper, such rates will be denoted
by P,;’s, where i refers to an age level, j
to cohort, and k to period. Given this interpretation, it is natural to conceptualize an n(A) * n(C) * n(P) table of rates
(where (A) represents the number of
age categories, n(A) * n(C) * n(P) * 2 table of frequencies (n,x) where [=1 if a
pregnancy leads tot he death of the
mother and /=2 if it does not. It should
be pointed out here that at most one p,x
can be nonzero for each (i,j) age-cohort
combination and that the four-way n(A)
* n(C) * n(P) * 2 contingency table actually contains many structural zeros because of the logical relationship between
age, cohort, and period. In the analysis,
we will assume that Pj, = Myxr/ Nyx. #0
when n,, # 0, where nx. = Myg + Myk2
is the number of pregnancies in the specified (age, cohort, period) combination. This assumption is imposed to insure that all the parameter values in the
models are finite.

It is generally recognized that the
proper quantity for statistical modeling
in such a multinomial context with a binary response is the odds on maternal
death fox = My / Mg rather than the
age, cohort, and period-specific rates
themselves (Goodman, 1972; Bishop et
al., 1975; Pullum, 1980). These odds are
related to the rates through fy, = Dyk /
(1—p,,x) and will be used in our analysis.
In this paper, the number of surviving
mothers 1,42 is approximated by subtracting the number of maternal deaths

 

Maternal Mortality

403

Nyx from that of the total live births,
since the latter figure is used to estimate
the number of pregnancies.

The natural logarithm of such ratio,
termed logit, is a monotonic function of
the ratio and has the additional advantage of easy modeling in the binaryresponse situation (for detailed discussion on logit transformation, see
Fienberg, 1980). Therefore, we will use
logit model in this paper.

Data on maternal mortality by age
and live births by mother’s age have
been published in annual volumes of Vital Statistics of the U.S. since 1915. This
research is a secondary analysis of the
data on maternal deaths and live births
contained in these annual volumes.

To calculate a cohort maternal mortality for all ages, age-specific period
rates of maternal mortality are simply
rearranged into cohort form. Since cohort year, age, and calendar year are
functionally related, specification of two
of the three variables determines the
third. The relationship among the three
variables is:

Cohort Year of Birth=
Calendar Year— Age.

By using this simple relationship, selection of a particular age-specific period
ratio which describes the experience of a
given cohort at a given age and time is
straightforward.

The method of calculating period
rates for five-year age groups to describe
the experience, at five-year intervals, of
five-year cohorts, provides age-specific,
cohort-specific rates for only eight fiveyear cohorts (see Tables t and 2). Period
maternal mortality rates are available
only for the eight five-year cohorts that
have completed their childbearing years
and, therefore, their exposures to ma

eight five-year cohorts are the cohorts of
1898-1902, 1903-07, 1908-12, 1913-17,
1918-22, 1923-27, 1928-32 and 193337. These cohorts will be called the complete cohorts. The period categories can
be determined by knowledge of age and
cohort membership through the following relationship:

n(period) = n(age) + n(cohort)—1.

METHODOLOGY

We adopt the model-fitting procedure which provides us with parametric
models and their goodness-of-fit measures. The advantage of this approach is
to present models easy to understand
and interpret. Through the selected
model (or models), we are able to ascer
tain the association structure between
the variables of interest. In this context,
linear logit models utilizing additional
diagonal parameters (Goodman, 1972)
were employed to analyze the effects of
age, period, and cohort simultaneously.
The most general logit model under our
consideration is as follows:

logit(i,j,k) = In yl (1— pix)
= wtA,+C,, + Py

(1)

where p,, is the maternal mortality rate
introduced earlier and A,,, C, and p,,
represent the age, cohort, and period effects at the various levels.

By setting various terms in (1) equal
to zero, we obtained different logit models. The parameters in a proposed logit
model were estimated by the maximum
likelihood method. Cyclic ascent alDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

gorithm was used in a tailored Fortran
program to produce such estimates. Under this algorithm, Newton-Raphson
approximation was applied to sets of parameters, €.g., age parameters, period
parameters, and cohort parameters, respectively. In each iteration, the current
parameter values were used to estimate
the expected cell counts which were
then used to calculate the likelihood ratio statistic G* defined in (2). The parameter estimates were improved in a
cyclic fashion until the difference in the
successive G’’s was smaller than 0.0001
in five consecutive iterations. The asymptotic covariance of the parameters
estimates is given by the inverse of the
information matrix, a result from the
large sample theory. (In practice, the estimated parameters are substituted for
the unknown parameters for inference

purpose.)

The G? at convergence was used to
assess the fit of a proposed logit model.
The G*, which is asymptotically equivalent to the Pearson’s y’ statistic defined
in (3), has an asymptotic chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom given
by the ({the number of observed

the model] + [the number of constraints
imposed]).

The calculation of the degrees of
freedom for the logit models with at
most two factors can be carried out in
the usual way and poses no problem.
However, the calculation requires some
caution when all the age, period, and cohort effects are present. According to
Clogg (1980), there are four identification constraints on the parameters in the
additive age-cohort-period model for
two-way contingency tables when one
factor is introduced diagonally. A paral

lel argument to Clogg’s shows that the
inclusion of the inverse-diagonal parameters introduced by the period variable
to our age-cohort analysis results in four
similar identification constraints. Out of
the four, three of them are trivial in the
sense that they are required in order to
define main effects for the categories of
the three variables. The additional
fourth one, however, is nontrivial in that
the effect of an inverse-diagonal category is set equal to some specified constant. If this inverse-diagonal effect is
mistakenly assumed, all of the estimated
age, period, and cohort effects will be in
error. Clogg (1980) demonstrates how
an error in imposing this nontrivial identifying restriction propagates error or
bias in all the other effects of the model.
For detailed discussion, see Clogg
(1980). This problem regarding the specification of the identifying constraints
does not concern the two-parameter
models (models which contain only two
variables).

Due to the linear relationship between age, calendar year, and cohortship, several researchers (Baltes, 1968;
Goldstein, 1968; Glenn, 1976) suggest
excluding one of these three factors
from the model in the cohort analysis.
However, we prefer the argument given
by Mason et al. (1973) that such a procedure is not necessary and certain variables should be dropped only if they do
not seem to have significant effect upon
the dependent variable after adjustment
for other variables.

The contribution of a variable or variables in explaining the variation existing
in the data is measured by the difference
in the G? statistics between the two
models with and without the variable or
variables in question. The difference is
then compared to the percentiles of a
chi-square distribution with degrees of

freedom equal to the difference between the degrees of freedom of the two
corresponding G?’s. By doing this, we
can determine whether the reduction in
the fit is significant or not at a given level
(for detail in the G*-decomposition, see
Fienberg [1980].

RESULTS

The results of fitting various linear logit models to the data are shown in Table 3. The G’, x’, as well as the degrees
of freedom are given for each model
fitted. the convergence took place
within 15 iterations under all the models
we tried. As a comparison, we also included in Table 3 the 95 percentiles of
chi-square distributions with degrees of
freedom equal to those of the corresponding G?. Here, we face the same situation as Pullum (1980) did in his fertility study since these models were applied to the population data rather than
sample data drawn from the New York
State. However, if we consider US. national maternal mortality as the conceptual population and the New York State
data as a sample drawn from this population, we are still able to draw inferences regarding the age, period, or cohort effects from these goodness-of-fit
Statistics.

The results in Table 3 suggest that
age, period, and cohort, when included
in the models alone, all increase the fit
significantly. The results also suggest
that both Model (5) and (7) provide adequate fit to the data at the 0.05 level.
However, the reduction in G* by including the cohort variable after adjustment
for age and period effects is only 2.69
( =21.34—18.65) which is much too low
when compared to the percentiles of a
chi-square distribution with six degrees
of freedom. Therefore, we chose Model

(5) which suggests that both age and period are essential in explaining the difference in maternal mortality, and cohortship does not contribute much after both
age and period are already in the model.

This observation coincides with that
made by Pullum’s fertility study that
adding period dimension had greater
impact per degree of freedom than adding the cohort dimension (Pullum,
1980). This result is also implied by Figure 2 where the negatives of the observed logits were plotted agains the calendar years for each age group. Similar
trends along the years for the age groups
in Figure 2 cause the curves to be almost
parallel and suggest the additive effects
of age and period upon the logits. °

In Table 4, we give the parameter estimates W,A,,, P., and their standard errors under Model (5). The constraints
we adopted were A, =P(3,=0 which
put the last age and period groups as the
baseline groups. (The appropriateness
of the constraints is no longer a problem
since there are only two variables in
Model [5].) The age parameter estimates A q have the minimum value at
the 20-24 age group. This phenomenon
is also reflected in Figure 2 since the
curve corresponding to this age group
lies above all the other curves. The Ag
and) are of similar magnitude and the

 

 

two corresponding curves in Figure 2
cross each other. The fact that the other
three age curves (for age groups 30-34,
35-39, and 40-44) are lying unintersected and in a decreasing order yields
similar relationships among Aw)s As,
and Aj.

The results regarding age parameters
suggest that the age group 20-24 faces
the least maternal mortality risk, while
for women beyond 30 the maternal mortality risk increases rather rapidly with
the increase of age. This occurred prob

ably because medical advances were
able to control causes of maternal death
such as infection, hemorrhage, and toxemia more effectively than indirect
causes such as heart disease or diabetes.
Since indirect causes are more common
among older women, they benefited less
from the overall decline in maternal
mortality.

The period parameters estimates
Po. plotted against the years in Figure
3, show some monotonic decreasing
trend except for Puy which corresponds
to 1962 and is slightly larger than the
value for the previous period level. This,
presumably, is due to the big dip occurring in the 40-44 age group curve given in
Figure 2. Due to the fact that there is
only one pair of observations (corre
sponding to the age group 40-44) in the
1977 data and that one of them is zero,
the estimate for this year is less precise
compared to the rest and ts therefore excluded from the discussion and Figure 3.
Among the 12 remaining period intervals, the period effects estimates decrease slightly from 9.521 to 9.393 between 1917 and 1932. The decreasing
trend picks up speed between 1932 and
1952, during which the estimates range
from 9.393 to 6.871. Then, quite,
abruptly this downward trends comes almost to a halt. Between 1952 and 1967
only minor decreases take place and
then another big jump is seen in 1972.
The period effects estimates were found
to be positively correlated from the asymptotic covariance calculation. This

result can also be seen from the generally monotonic trends across the calendar years in Figure 3.

To examine the fit of Model (5) further, we plotted in Figure 4 the residuals
in logit scale (= [observed logit]—[fitted
logit under Model (5)}) for each age
group across the periods where data are
available. The zigzag, up and down patterns in the residual plot indicate that
Model (5) does not show signs of significant lack of fit in any direction. The residuals for the younger age groups are
clustered around zero. The rather high
variation among the residuals for the
oldest age group (40-44) results from
the fact that the observed Jogits for this
group have higher variability than the

 

corresponding ones in other age groups
because of the diminishing numbers in
both the pregnancies and the maternal
deaths. The residuals for this group thus
have higher standard errors and exhibit
greater fluctuation. The two fairly
downward dips occurring around 1957
and 1962 cannot be fully explained by
the slight increase in the period effects
estimates around this time.

In examining Figure 4, we found also
that the observed logits for the next oldest age group (35-39) were smaller than
the fitted ones for the most recent years.
That is, the risk for this age group
seemed to have declined at a rate faster
than Model (5) suggests. This finding is
similar to those in Berry’s (1977) study.

Fic. 4.—Residuals in logit scale for age and period combination.

One possible explanation may lie in the
selecting out of higher order births as a
factor in the death rate decline and in
the possibility that at high mortality levels poor risks are weeded out earlier in
their reproductive careers, leaving a
hardier cohort to reproduce later in life
(Nortman, 1974).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A cohort study was invoked in this
paper on the logits of maternal mortality
rates. The results indicate that cohortship is not a significant explanatory variable to the logits of maternal mortality
after adjustment for age and period.
Also, adding period dimension after adjustment for age has greater impact per
degree of freedom than adding the cohort dimension after adjustment for

age. One possible reason is that cohort
effects on maternal mortality are extremely small, particularly in comparison to period effects. The implications
of our findings on New York maternal
mortality are that, as a set, changes in
those temporal variables which cut
across cohorts appear to be more important than changes in those variables
which distinguish them.

We also referred to specific parametrizations of the selected model and gave
interpretations to the parameters in the
model. The age * period logit model was
chosen to describe the data and the
trends across age groups and calendar
years were noticed and discussed. This
simple mode] was found to fit the data
reasonably well on average, although
the fluctuation in the residuals for the
Vol. 30, No. 4

oldest age group (40-44) is slightly
higher due to the stochastic variation in
diminishing small numbers of maternal
deaths and pregnancies in this group.
