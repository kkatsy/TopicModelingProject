& ABSTRACT: The analyses shown here indicate that the pervasiveness of fertility trends found
‘earlier for the 1950’s and 1960’s has continued for the 1970’s. The national period fertility
'& trends have occurred within every racial, social, and economic subgroup examined. As before,
& there is no evidence of a narrowing of fertility differentials within successive cross-sections. Var9 iables, such as race or education, continue to exert effects on cross-sectional fertility differences.
Q Standard socioeconomic variables operate to shift the entire trend line up or down, but do not
& explain the trend line. The question remains of what causes changes in period fertility rates in

D developed societies.

Since World War II, period fertility
rates have fluctuated with a relatively
‘Slarge amplitude. Despite the fact that
-= these fluctuations have had widespread
effects on many aspects of society, the
“= exact causes of these fluctuations are not
>,well understood. In earlier work (Rind‘2 fuss and Sweet, 1977), we examined ferStility trends and differentials in the
‘5 United States during the period from
>the late 1940’s to the late 1960’s. During
5 the period, we found that those fluctua3 tions were pervasive, that is, similar
-< fluctuations were found within every so2 cially defined subgroup that we could
Q examine.

In the early 1970s, there was a quite
rapid decline in the fertility rates of
American women. The fertility rate
reached an historic low in the mid-1970’s
and has been roughly constant since. In
the present paper, we use data from the
1976 Survey of Income and Education
and from the March Current Population
Surveys from 1968 to 1980 to examine
the degree to which these trends during
the 1970’s are found within various
strata of our society. To preview our

results, the answer is that the fertility
trends of the 1970’s have been just as
ubiquitous as those of the 1950’s and
1960's.

The next section of the paper discusses the methodological issues involved in estimating age-specific fertility
rates from survey data. Then we document the ubiquity of the fertility trends
of the 1970’s. Subsequently, we show
that cross-sectional differentials have remained virtually unchanged. The final
section discusses some implications of
these findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The fertility rates shown in this paper
have been calculated from own children
data—an approach which has now become standard in the study of period fertility rates (e.g., Cho, 1971; Cho et al.,
1970; Grabill and Cho, 1965; Retherford and Cho, 1974; Rindfuss and
Sweet, 1977). In the United States Census, an own child is defined as a child of
the household head or of a subfamily
head. This includes not only children

who have been born to the women, but
also children who have been adopted,
and stepchildren which the mother acquired by marrying the father of the
child. The fraction of all children who
are living with their mothers (or stepmothers) is very high and is similar in the
data sets used here. In Table 1 we provide measures of the fraction of children, by age and race, who are living
with their mothers. The fraction of children living with their mothers is larger at
all ages for whites in 1976 than 1970. The
differences are generally in the range of
0.8 to 1.5 percentage points higher in
1976 and tend to be larger at the older
ages than the younger ages. At each age
up to 12, 97 per cent of children are living with their mothers. For nonwhites,
there is also a tendency for this fraction

is slightly different. The SIE, like the
Current Population Survey, does not include the institutional population. The
increased fraction of children living with
their mothers may be due in part to the
exclusion of the institutional population
from the SIE. The fraction of children in
group quarters, most of whom are in institutions, in 1970 is shown in Table 2.
The difference in coverage probably
does not account for more than half of
the increase between 1970 and 1976.
The count of own children excludes
any children who may have died or

moved away and are thus not living with
the mother. In addition, the validity of
own-child fertility measurement depends on the completeness of enumeration of both mothers and children by
age, and the survival of mothers and
children to the time of the interview.

In our earlier study we made several
attempts to evaluate these own children
data. In general, we found that rates
produced in this manner track the annual change in fertility (as measured in
the Vital Statistics system) quite well,
but there is a scale difference. The rates
computed by the own-child methodology tend to be lower by a relatively constant proportion within a given social
group when compared to the vital statistics rates. However, the proportion varies among groups. For example, the differential is larger for blacks than it is for
whites. For purposes of comparison
across groups, restriction to marital fertility in recent years minimizes the scale
differences.

In many respects, the 1976 Survey of
Income and Education (SIE) and the
Current Population Survey (CPS) are
miniature versions of the decennial census. In general, a similar set of questions
was asked of persons in the March
CPS’s, the 1976 SIE, and the decennial
censuses. There are differences, however. The censuses, of course, are a
complete enumeration, while the SIE
and CPS are sample surveys. The interviewers used to conduct SIE and CPS
are professional interviewers who have
considerable training and experience in
the conduct of household enumeration.
In most areas of the United States, the
1970 Census was conducted not by an
enumerator, but rather by a procedure
of self-enumeration in which the individual respondent filled in and returned
the census form without the involvement of a census enumerator. Thus,

Fertility Trends 129

there is the question of whether surveys,
like the SIE, can do as good a job of
tracking annual trends in fertility among
subgroups as censuses.

In order to explore this issue, we
computed annual total fertility rates using own children data from the SIE and
compared these with rates obtained
from the vital registration system. The
results are shown in Figure 1 for whites
and nonwhites.! It can be seen that, for
both whites and nonwhites, the SIE estimates are below the vital statistics estimates. This is not surprising given such
factors as infant mortality or the giving
up of children for adoption. Note, however, that for both whites and nonwhites, the same trend estimates are obtained from the SIE series as the vital
registration series. This means that the
SIE can be used to accurately estimate
trends for various subgroups. These are
fertility estimates for all women irrespective of their marital status. Since
most children who do not live with their
mothers are children of women who are
not currently married, we can make
valid cross-sectional comparisons of recent marital fertility by restricting the
sample to currently married women.

A related question is how close are
the estimates from the SIE to the estimates from the census. In order to examine this question, we have taken the
Vital registration estimates as our standard of comparison and related the census and SIE estimates to this standard.
The results are shown in Table 3 for the
period 1945-1975. Looking first at the
averages for each data source, it can be
seen that for both whites and nonwhites,
the SIE estimates are somewhat closer
to the vital registration rates than the

1It should be noted that the SIE estimates have
not been adjusted for such factors as infant mortality or undercount. See Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977,
Chapter 2 for a fuller discussion of this issue.

census estimates. This may be the result
of the SIE relying more heavily on a
trained and experienced staff of professional interviewers. For example, when
an additional form is needed to list all
the members in a large household (e.g.,
Coale and Rives, 1973), professional interviewers are more likely to use such a
form and thus list the younger children
in the household.

A second point can be seen from Ta
ble 3. The annual comparisons of the
SIE estimates to the vital registration estimates tend to vary more from year to
year than the comparisons of the censuses. The reason is that the number of
cases upon which the SIE estimates are
based is substantially smaller than the
number of cases upon which the census
estimates are based. Similarly, the nonwhite SIE estimates tend to fluctuate
more than the white SIE estimates (see

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

TOTAL FERTILITY -RATE

132

Figure 1), because there are substantially fewer nonwhites than whites. The
reason, as Retherford and Bennett
(1977) point out, is that “the sample
sizes required to keep relative confidence intervals below 10 percent are
generally quite large.’’? Thus even
though the SIE is a large sample by normal social science standards, containing
over 100,000 women of childbearing
age, it will not be possible to examine
annual fertility rates for some of the
smaller subgroups as could be done with
census data.

At some points in this paper, we also
extend our time series past 1975 by using
own children estimates from the March
CPS’s. Because the sample sizes for the
CPS’s are considerably smaller than for
the SIE, whenever the CPS’s are used,

2Bean and Swicegood (1982) report similar
findings for 1974 and 1975.

Sweet and Rindfuss

Social Biology

estimates will be obtained by pooling
data from three adjacent CPS’s. When
we compared such estimates for 1969
with census estimates for 1969, the two
were almost identical, with the CPS estimates being slightly larger as expected.
Thus, with either the CPS or the SIE
surveys It is possible to obtain accurate
estimates of period fertility rates, provided the sample sizes are not too small.

RESULTS

Annual total fertility rates for five education groups are plotted in Figure 2.4

3The reader interested in more detail can write
to Sweet for a working paper describing comparisons of the census, CPS, and SIE estimates.

4As discussed in Rindfuss and Sweet (1977),
the rates for education groups for the two years
closest to the census are misleading and thus are
not shown here. Further, in both Figures 2 and 3,
whenever two valid estimates for the same year
were available they were averaged and then plotted.

As can be seen, the pervasiveness that
was evident during the 1950’s and 1960’s
has continued into the 1970’s. Even
though the series is a bit unstable for the
two lowest education groups because of
the small numbers of women involved,
all five groups experienced similar
trends, including a substantial decline in
fertility levels between the late 1960’s
and early 1970's.

The per cent decline in fertility between 1967 and 1973 for each of the educational groups is:

group, the relative declines in fertility
during this period are essentially identical. Pervasiveness has indeed continued
with respect to fertility trends and education.

Similarly, the trends have been ubiquitous across regions. Figure 3 shows the
trend in fertility since World War II for
Southern and non-Southern women.
Although there are a few differences
(see Rindfuss et al., 1978), both regions
overall have experienced similar trends.
Both groups experienced substantial declines in the early 1970’s.°

In order to examine the trend in fertility during the 1970’s among other subgroups, we shift to an alternative fertil
*Both groups also had a slight decrease in fertility in the late 1960’s. This increase was more pronounced among southerners. Examination of
more detailed figures shows that it is found among

all education groups and is more pronounced
among older than younger women.

ity measure; the number of own
children aged less than three years
among currently-married women. The
own children under three measure essentially averages three years of fertility
exposure, thus reducing the need for
larger samples. The restriction to
currently-married women also makes it
possible to use own children data to examine differentials within a crosssection (see Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977,
Ch, 2)—an advantage we will utilize in
the next section of this paper.°®

Further, to extend the time series
into the late 1970’s we use data from the
March Current Population Surveys of
1969-80. In order to obtain sufficient
cases to make reliable estimates, we
combine samples for 1969-71, 1975-77
and 1978-80—using the middle year to
identify the three-year combined sample. These estimates are shown in Table
4 separately for whites and blacks. Also
shown in Table 4 are estimates of fertil
6It needs to be emphasized that the trend and
differential estimates that follow only apply to currently married women. During the 1970's the marital status distribution of women in the childbearing
ages (18-39) changed considerably:

Marital Status 1969 1974 1980
Never married ..... 23 25 30
Currently married .. 69 65 57
Post married ...... 7 9 12
Total ....... 100 =100 ~~ =(100

We refer to our estimates as ‘“‘marital fertility.”
That is, strictly speaking, not correct. The reference period is the three years prior to the date of
survey. Some women were not married during all
of that period and some may have had a nonmarital birth during the period. Other women who
were married during the three-year reference period are no longer married. Hence some marital
births and some marital exposure to risk is missed.
In the absence of marital and birth histories, more
“correct” estimates are impossible. We are convinced that these estimates are satisfactory for our
purposes. However, age at first marriage, marital
disruption, remarriage, and pre- and intermarital
births do not occur at random in the population.
Some of the differentials reported here may be biased by these processes.

ity change from the Census-SIE comparison for 1970-76. In general, the
Census-SIE and the CPS series show
similar change patterns, although there
are some deviations. We will use the
CPS figures in the text.

For white women, fertility fell substantially between 1970 and 1976 for all
subpopulations. The aggregate decline
was about 20 per cent. For most subgroups shown, the decline was between
15 and 25 per cent. Larger declines were
experienced by older women aged 3539 (34 per cent) and for women at parities 2 and beyond (35-40 per cent).’

Between 1976 and 1979 the fertility of
white married women rose slightly by 2
per cent. For most subgroups, there was
an increase in fertility. For those groups
whose fertility continued to decline, the
rate of decline was slow in comparison
to that experienced in the earlier period.
There was an increase in fertility at all
ages except age 35-39. The historical decline in fertility of women in their late
30’s continued. There was an increase at
every education level except for college
graduates. Fertility continued to decline
at initial parities 1 and 2, reflecting the
increased concentration of family size at
one and two children. Women with initial parities 0, 3, and 4 or more all experienced increased fertility. There was a
small decline in fertility in the northeast
(4 per cent) and south (1 percent), anda

’Neither the SIE nor the March CPS’s asked
women the number of children that they had ever
borne. As a result, initial parity here had to be
defined as the number of own children under age
18 minus the number of own children under age
three. In our earlier work, initial parity was
defined as the number of children ever born minus
the number of own children under three. We were
concerned that for older women this might make a
considerable difference. To check, the results from
the 1970 census were run both ways and it makes
essentially no difference to the general pattern of
our results.

rise in the north central (7 per cent) and
western (4 per cent) regions. Fertility
levels rose for couples with husbands
earning relatively low incomes as well as
for couples with husbands earning relatively large incomes (incomes are ex
pressed in constant 1970 dollars), although for two income categories in the
low to moderate range, there appears to
be a slight decrease.

Overall, we are struck by the consistency among subgroups in the cessation

of marital fertility decline and the slight
increase in fertility experienced by most
subgroups during the later part of the
1970's.

For black women the overall decline
in marital fertility between 1970 and
1976 was 24 per cent. Almost every subgroup shown experienced a decline in
fertility. (The one exception—college
graduates—appears to be the result of
sampling variability, since the 1970
census—1976 SIE estimates for this
group show a large decrease in fertility.)® The declines were concentrated in
the 15 to 30 per cent range, with larger
declines experienced by women aged
35-39 (43 per cent), women living in
nonmetropolitan areas (35 per cent),
and women with initial parity of 3 and
over (about 45 per cent). Only a very
small decline was experienced by
women whose husbands earned less
than $2,000 (in 1970 dollars).

During the period 1976 to 1979, the
rate of decline in black fertility slowed to
3 per cent, compared to a 2 per cent increase for whites. For most subgroups
fertility either increased or decreased at
a slower rate than during the early
1970’s. However, the picture is not
nearly as orderly as that for the fertility
of white women. Given the comparatively small sample sizes for blacks, this
is not surprising. In general, however,
the black groups either had an increase
in fertility during the latter part of the
1970’s or asmaller decrease than was the
case during the early part of the 1970's.
There can be no doubt that for all of

’The Census-SIE and CPS estimate of fertility
change are quite similar for most subgroups. Apart
from the black college graduate discrepancy, the
other major exceptions are: black women under 20
and black women of parity zero. In both cases the
CPS shows a substantial decline, while the censusSIE series shows essentially no change.

these groups—black and white—the latter part of the 1970’s marked a transition
point for period fertility trends.

CROSS-SECTIONAL
DIFFERENCES

To this point we have been examining trends in fertility with various subgroups and have found them to be ubiquitous. Put differently, the standard
socioeconomic variables used in various
fertility studies do not predict or explain
the trend in fertility in the United States
during the 35 years we have examined.
There ts a related question, indeed one
which is more typically asked by social
demographers: To what extent do these
socioeconomic variables produce fertility differentials within a cross-section?
In the present section, we examine this
question and find that the same variables which did not differentiate with respect to trends produce substantial
cross-sectional differences in every
cross-section.

Because the concern is with differences in the levels of fertility between
groups, the focus is on the number of
own children under three for currentlymarried women aged less than 40. The
results shown in Table 5 are derived
from multiple regression analyses of differential fertility and are “net’’ differentials, i.e., after controlling for the other
factors discussed. The analyses were
conducted within each racial group and
within each year. The variables included
in the model are: education, husband’s
income in 1960 constant dollars, wife’s
age, initial parity of the wife, region of
residence, and the metropolitan and
farm status of her residence.

Among whites, the pattern of differentials observed in 1970 persists almost
unchanged in 1976. The higher the level

of education, the lower the fertility in
both years. In 1970, there was a continuOus decline of fertility with education.
However, by 1976, the fertility of college 13-15 groups is no different than
that of the college graduates. The relationship of fertility with husband’s income is also very similar in the two
years. With the one exception of husband’s income of $1000~1999 (in 1960
constant dollars) the two patterns are almost identical with the 1976 rates—
approximately 100 points lower than the

1970 rates at the given income level. In
both years there was the characteristic
upward slope of fertility on current income. Rindfuss and Sweet (1977, pp.
75-82) present evidence that this positive effect is due to the accelerated childbearing of young couples at the point
where their income increases. In short,
income has a positive effect on the timing of fertility, but not necessarily on the
quantity of fertility.

The relationship of fertility with initial parity is.also very similar in the two

time periods. Again, the 1976 values are
about 100 points below the 1970 values
at every initial parity level. Finally, the
regional differences are quite large. Fertility of white women was lowest in the
southern region in 1970 and highest in
the northeastern region net of other
compositional factors. By 1976, the pattern of differentials had changed very
little. Southern fertility was still the lowest and the northeast and north central
regions had almost identical levels,
which were considerably higher than
fertility in the western region. Exactly
why region should be related to fertility
is unknown at present. (This issue is discussed at length in Rindfuss, 1978.)

Among blacks, the education differential is quite similar in both 1970 and
1976—with the exception of those who
did not go beyond elementary school.
Similarly, the pattern by husband’s income is virtually unchanged between
1970 and 1976. In both cases, there is
generally a positive relationship. Also,
with the exception of childless women,
the effect of initial parity is very similar
in both years.

An exception to this similarity of patterns in both 1970 and 1976 is found for
the regional differentials among blacks.
In 1970, there was relatively little variation in black fertility among the regions.
The north central region had the highest
level and the rates for the other three regions were quite similar. By 1976 there
is more regional variation.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The analyses shown here indicate
that the pervasiveness of fertility trends
found earlier for the 1950’s and 1960's
has continued for the 1970’s. The national period fertility trends have occurred within every racial, social, and

Social Biology

economic subgroup that we have been
able to examine. As before, there is no
evidence of a narrowing of fertility differentials within successive crosssections as we proceed further into the
post-modern fertility era. Variables
such as race or education continue to exert effects on cross-sectional fertility differences.

Viewing the past 35 years in their entirety, socioeconomic variables seem to
act as “multipliers.” That is, standard
socioeconomic variables operate to shift
the entire trend line up or down, as the
case may be. However, they do not
“explain” the trend line; nor are predictions about future changes in the socioeconomic characteristics of the population likely to be helpful in predicting the
future course of fertility.

Thus, this still leaves American demographers with the problem of explaining the fluctuations in period fertility rates—fluctuations which have had,
and continue to have, important effects
on almost every institution within our
society. Why have these fluctuations occurred? What caused the “‘baby boom”’
or the “birth dearth’? Throughout
much of the 1970’s, Easterlin’s (1962,
1966, 1973, 1978, 1980) relative income
hypothesis was the leading contender to
explain these trends. However, recent
evidence at both the macro (Butz and
Ward, 1979; Ermisch, 1979) and the mi- —
cro (MacDonald and Rindfuss, 1978,
1981) level has failed to confirm the relative income hypothesis.

What factors then do explain these
fluctuations? Despite the fact that there
has been some conjecture in the literature, the simple fact is that we do not
know. This is one of the major tasks facing demographers today: What causes
changes in period fertility levels in developed societies? The very pervasiveDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

ness of the trends, both within and
among societies, constitutes an essential
fact with which any attempt at explanation must contend.
