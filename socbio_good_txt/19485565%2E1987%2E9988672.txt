Sex Differentials in Cardiovascular Mortality:
Spatial Variations in the United States

ABSTRACT: The nature and extent of spatial variations in sex-specific cardiovascular mortality
rates arid sex mortality ratios are examined at the county level for the United States. The
southeastern United States has the highest mortality rates for both males and females, while the
central United States has the highest sex mortality ratios. When mortality is aggregated by
levels of urbanization and types of migration for the United States as a whole, the pattern of
relationship varies. The lowest rates for both sexes are found in large urban in-migration
counties, while large urban out-migration counties have the lowest sex mortality ratio. The
highest rates for males are in rural out-migration areas and for females in large urban
out-migration areas. The highest sex mortality ratio occurs in rural in-migration counties. The
decomposition of sex differentials in sex-specific mortality indicates that the sex mortality ratio

is primarily a function of female mortality.

Sex differentials in mortality’ have
been well documented. In general,
males have higher rates of mortality
than females in all age groups. How
_ever, excess male mortality has in
creased in most developed countries, including the United States, adding to a
widening of the differentials. The increasing differentials in mortality by sex
have been attributed to the male disadvantage relative to cardiovascular disease mortality (Preston, 1976; Gee and
Veevers, 1983; Lopez, 1983).

Among the components of major
cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischemic
heart disease (IHD) makes the largest
contribution to sex mortality differentials (Waldron, 1982). Since 1968, substantial progress has been made in reducing IHD mortality. Notwithstanding, heart disease is still by far the leading cause of death. Moreover, female
death rates for IHD declined more rapidly than those of males (Rosenberg and
Klebba, 1979; Patrick et al., 1982) and

thus the gap in relative risk between
males and females widened.

At the risk of oversimplification, one
may say that sex differentials in mortality arise from two broad groups of
causes: biological-genetic and environmental (behavioral, sociocultural, and
physical environment). However, since
the genetic code varies too slowly, the
increases in sex mortality differentials
must be related to changes in the environment. While the paper focuses on
environmental or external factors associated with sex mortality differentials,
we recognize that the impact of environmental changes operates through biological differences between the sexes
and that the impact of biological sex differences on sex mortality differentials
varies under different sets of environmental conditions. In fact, these two
factors are interconnected, and comprehension of the mechanisms involved ultimately requires an understanding of
both.

In the search for causes of mortality,
studies have observed significant interregional, interstate, and intercounty
variations in differentials in CVD and
IHD mortality (Sauer, 1962; Hetcher
and Bohani, 1965; Meade, 1979;
Ziegenfus and Gesler, 1984). However,
no studies have been made focusing on
the spatial variations of sex mortality
differentials. By identifying areas with
high sex mortality differentials, we can
generate hypotheses to determine possible causal factors. Sex differentials are
the function of two components: male
and female mortality. Different levels of

the sex differential can result from vari-.

ous combinations of male and female
mortality. Thus, it is necessary to understand male and female mortality first in
order to understand sex differentials in
mortality.

In any analysis of spatial variations in
mortality, two variables require attention, namely, urbanization and migration. Urbanization is a process of popujation concentration within a given
geographical area. It implies significant
differences in lifestyles, quality of physical environment, occupational characteristics, and accessibility to medical
services, etc. These differences in living
conditions are assumed to impact mortality differentially. It is also assumed
that the populations of various geographic units have been more or less exposed to similar environmental risks.
Migration, however, has the potential of
altering the “at risk’’ population; yet
the evidence to date on how seriously
migration can distort geographical studies of mortality is contradictory (Polissar, 1980; Greenburg, 1983).

Rural-urban residence has traditionally been a useful parameter in identifying population groups with particularly
high mortality risks (Keppel, 1983;

Social Biology

Greenberg, 1983; Clifford and Brannon, 1985). However, considerable variability exists in the extent and nature of
rural-urban differentials (Clifford et
al., 1986). The conflicting observations
concerning mortality differentials between urban and rural areas may be a
function of the units of analysis and/or of
migration playing an intervening role in
the relationship between urbanization
and mortality.

Population change resulting from migration is related to the health status of
an area by disrupting the demographic
composition of the population. Most of
all, the age structure of an area is affected by the age selectivity of migrants.
Since migration tends to be selective of
young persons, areas receiving large
numbers of migrants are likely to increase the pool of young persons, who
are at less risk of dying than older persons. Similarly, areas experiencing outmigration tend to have older populations. At the same time, the young can
be expected to migrate to urban areas
with extensive and varied job opportunities, while such concerns play less of a
role in elderly migration (Cebula, 1979;
Lichter et al., 1979; Heaton, et al.,
1981). In other words, the net effect of
migration may be changes in the age
structure of the population which
strongly influence the level of mortality.
Of course, some of this variation can be
accounted for by age-standardizing
mortality rates. However, the base population may still contain a substantial
level of bias due to the fact that migration also affects other aspects of population composition. Migration is selective
of occupation, education, and income to
name a few. Finally, migration independently affects rates of mortality in that
the “at risk” population does not reflect
the cumulative effects of its members’

exposure to environmental factors.
Given limited information concerning the extent and nature of spatial variations in sex differentials in cardiovascular mortality, the need for additional
research is evident. This article attempts
to expand our empirical knowledge by
examining sex differentials in CVD
mortality by level of urbanization and
migration. The analysis focuses on the
period between 1970 and 1980 and utilizes county data for the United States.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The mortality data base is derived
from the United States micro death records from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS), 1970-80.
The population data base is derived
from Intercensal Estimates of the Population of Counties by Age, Sex, and
Race, 1970-80, prepared by the Bureau
of the Census in 1984. Urbanization
figures were compiled from the 1972
County and City Data Book, and migration from the 1975 Current Population
Survey Reports. For mortality rates,
complete data exist for all counties.
However, the absence of necessary data
prohibited the use of all United States
counties in the analysis of mortality by
level of urbanization and migration.!

Deaths to persons 25 to 64 years of
age were included in this study for the
following reasons. First, in counties with
small populations at risk in certain age
groups, even small numbers of deaths
can produce large fluctuations in death

Thirty-one counties in the state of Virginia
were excluded, because the data were reported for
independent cities and the surrounding adjacent
counties rather than combined into a single unit. In
addition, counties in Alaska were excluded, because deaths were reported for the state as a
whole.

rates. This phenomenon is particularly
critical among older age groups. Second, cardiovascular mortality of persons
under 25 years of age is rare. Third, it is
the middle age group that contributes
largely to sex differentials in cardiovascular mortality (Moriyama et al., 1971).

Cardiovascular deaths for this study
were defined as those classified according to the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (codes
390-429). To insure reliable death
rates, deaths were averaged over an 11year period, from 1970 to 1980. Death
rates were age-adjusted, using the direct
method with the 1975 United States total population as the standard. As a
measure of the sex mortality differential, the ratio of the male rate to the female rate was used.
- Level of urbanization was classified
into three categories: large urban, small
urban, and rural. Large urban counties
were at least 75 per cent urban in 1970.
Counties with between 50 and 75 per
cent of the population urban in 1970
were small urban. Counties with less
than 50 per cent of the population urban
were classified as rural. The annual rate
of net migration during 1970—75 among
individuals 25 to 64 years old was used to
classify counties into two migration
types: in-migration and out-migration
counties.”

Using Chiang’s (1961) method, we
calculated standard errors of mortality
rates to determine how confident one

follows:

K('/2) (Pi + P2)

where P, and P, are the total population in
1970 and 1975; K is the time interval,
here 5(1/2); and N is the number of net
migrants (see Shryrock et al., pp. 377—380).

can be that the rate for a particular
county differs from the rate for the
United States as a whole. If the confidence interval of a county does not
overlap with that of the United States,
the death rate of that area is statistically
significant at the 95 per cent confidence
level.

The size of the sex mortality ratio depends upon two components: male
death rates and female death rates. For
example, large ratios can result from abnormally low female mortality coupled
with a relatively high death rate for
males or may reflect higher male mortality compared to other populations having a similar level of female mortality. In
order to differentiate these contributions, we applied a component analysis
as follows (Lopez, 1983):

* MIF— MIF = (1/2) (M-M) (1/F + 1/F)

+ (1/2)(M + M) ((F-F)/F*F)

where:

M is the male mortality of the given
population,

F is the female mortality of the given
population,

M is the male mortality of the United
States,

Fis the female mortality of the United
States.

The first component on the right-hand
side of the equation measures the contribution arising from differences in male
mortality between the given population
and the total United States population;
and the second, the contribution due to
differences in female mortality.

RESULTS
SEX DIFFERENTIALS BY COUNTY

The age-adjusted CVD mortality
rates per 100,000 population are calculated at the county level. The range of

the male death rate is from 17.6 to 524.7,
and that of the female is from 0 to
222.0.3 The range of the sex mortality
ratio is from 0.26 to 19.00, with a mean
sex mortality ratio of 3.5, that is, the
male death rate is an average three and
one-half times higher than the female
rate in the United States as a whole.
Only eight out of 3,075 counties (0.26
per cent) have sex mortality ratios less
than 1.4

The maps in Figures 1 and 2 present
county tabulations of CVD mortality
and are designed to help visualize geographic variation at the county level.
The maps also serve to identify counties
with high CVD death rates, which in
turn may provide clues or hypotheses
concerning the etiology of CVD.

Counties within the highest quartile
of sex-specific death rates are presented
in the shaded portions of the maps. The
greatest concentrations of counties
within the highest quartile of death rates
for males are located largely in the
southeast. The patterns for females are
somewhat similar to those for males,
with the highest quartile areas concentrated to an even greater extent in the
southeastern United States. Although
not presented in these maps, to a very

3Fighteen out of 3,075 counties have a female
mortality rate of 0. These counties were eliminated
in the calculation of the sex mortality ratio.

‘The eight counties are as follows: McCone,
MT; Arthur, NE: Eureka, NV; Crockett, TX;
Kenedy, TX; King, TX; Sterling, TX; Terrell, TX.
Since these counties have relatively small populations and/or deaths, we calculated standardized Zscores to evaluate the reliability of the death rate.
The range of male Z-scores is from ~1.9 to -0.11
and that of female scores is from 0.01 to 0.61. Both
male and female death rates are not extreme cases.
Male death rates in these counties are lower than
the average male rate, while female death rates are
higher than the average female rate, leading to
lower sex mortality ratios.

substantial degree, the areas in the second quartile are located near areas in
the highest quartile. Death rates by sex
clearly indicate that death rates for females tend to parallel those for males,
but not perfectly. The strength of the association between male and female
mortality is quite strong (r = 0.59).

The sex mortality ratio, the male rate
divided by the female rate, provides a
measure for describing both similarities
and differences by sex in patterns of
death rates. In Figure 3, the shaded portions of the map represent the counties
with the highest quartile of ratios; that
is, the rates for males are 3.7 times or
more greater than the female rates.
These areas are widely scattered, but a
majority are located in the central part
of the United States where male and/or
female mortality levels are relatively
low.

SEX DIFFERENTIALS BY LEVEL OF
URBANIZATION AND TYPE OF MIGRATION

Age-adjusted mortality rates were
calculated by urbanization level. The
range of male mortality is from 22.98 in
small-urban counties to 243.88 in rural
counties, while that of female mortality
is from 70.12 in small-urban counties to
79.60 in large-urban counties. The range
of the sex mortality ratio is from 2.95 in
large-urban counties to 3.15 in smallurban counties. The most interesting
observation is that small-urban counties
have the lowest mortality rates for both
sexes accompanied by the highest sex
mortality ratios.

Standardized sex mortality differentials by urbanization level were calculated, with the sex-specific age-adjusted
rates of the United States as the base. As
presented in Table 1 (top panel), rural

counties have the highest mortality for
males, while large-urban counties have
the highest mortality for females. The
mortality of small-urban counties is
lower than the national average for both
sexes. As for sex mortality ratios, largeurban counties have lower sex mortality
ratios than the national average. All the
differentials between the national average and the urbanization groups are statistically significant.

Age-adjusted mortality rates were
calculated by migration type. The male
mortality rate 1s 224.76 for in-migration
counties and 242.76 for out-migration
counties, while for females the rates are
70.56 and 83.03, respectively. The sex
mortality ratio is 2.92 for out-migration
counties and 3.19 for in-migration counties. In-migration counties exhibit
higher sex mortality ratios than outmigration counties accompanied by

lower mortality rates for both sexes. The
mortality of in-migration counties is
lower, for both sexes, than that of the
nation as a whole (4 per cent less for
males, and 9 per cent less for females).
The sex mortality ratio is 4 per cent below the national average in outmigration counties. All the differentials
are statistically significant at the 95 per
cent confidence level.

Age-adjusted mortality rates were
calculated by level of urbanization and
type of migration simultaneously. The
range of male mortality is from 209.52
for large-urban in-migration counties to
254.59 for rural out-migration counties.
The range of female mortality rates is
from 66.38 for large-urban in-migration
counties to 85.86 for large-urban outmigration counties. The range of the sex
mortality ratio is from 2.88 for largeurban out-migration counties to 3.21 for
rural in-migration counties. Although
large-urban in-migration counties have
the lowest mortality rates for both sexes,
sex-specific mortality rates do not follow
the same pattern among other county
types. In other words, areas with the
highest level of male mortality do not
necessarily have the highest level of female mortality among other county
types.

Standardized sex mortality differentials provide additional information
concerning the relationship between
male and female mortality (Table 1,
lower panel). There is a clear
urbanization-migration interaction effect on sex mortality differentials, and
all the differentials between the nation
and the county groups are statistically
significant. For men, large-urban outmigration counties and all rural counties
have higher mortality than the national
average. For women, large-urban outmigration counties and rural out
Social Biology

 

migration counties have higher rates
than the national average. Counties
having higher mortality for males also
have higher mortality for females than
the nation as a whole. However, for rural in-migration counties, the male rate
is above the average, but the female rate
is below the average.

As for sex mortality ratios, smallurban out-migration counties and all inmigration counties have higher ratios
than the national average by more than
3 per cent. It should be emphasized
again that counties with lower female
mortality have higher sex mortality ratios regardless of male mortality.

DECOMPOSITION OF SEX MORTALITY
DIFFERENTIALS

Spatial variations of mortality by urbanization, migration, and urbanization
and migration simultaneously consistently revealed that areas with high levels
of female mortality have low levels of
sex mortality ratios, while areas with
low levels of female mortality have high
levels of sex mortality ratios. In order to
investigate the relationship between
sex-Specific mortality and the sex mortality ratio, we decomposed the differences between the sex mortality ratio for
a given county group and that based on
the national population in terms of male
and female contribution (Table 2). A
positively signed difference indicates
that a given county group has a higher
sex mortality ratio than the national average. A positively signed male or female component indicates that sexspecific mortality operates to increase
the differential between men and
women, while a negative sign signifies
the opposite effect.

The differences in sex mortality ratios result from various combinations of
male and female mortality. In rural in

migration counties, both male and female mortality increase the sex mortality ratio. In rural out-migration counties
and large-urban out-migration counties,
male mortality increases the sex mortality ratio, but female mortality decreases
it. On the other hand, in large-urban inmigration counties and all small-urban
counties, male mortality decreases the
sex mortality ratio, while female mortality increases it.

The effect of female mortality on the
sex mortality ratio, whether negative or
positive, far exceeds that of males for all
county types by urbanization and migration. In other words, female mortality
makes a greater contribution to the differential between the sex mortality ratio
for a given county group and that of the
national population. Taken together,
whatever the combination of male and
female mortality is, female mortality is
the primary factor accounting for the
size of sex mortality ratios. Indeed, the
strength of association between male
mortality and the sex mortality ratio at
the county level is negligible (r = 0.02),
while that of female mortality and the
sex mortality ratio is strong (r = 0.62).
That is, the higher the female mortality,
the lower the sex mortality ratio.

Cardiovascular Mortality

 

AGE-SPECIFIC SEX MORTALITY
DIFFERENTIALS

The risk of dying increases markedly
as one becomes older, and the increase
is dramatic for males. For all age groups,
the male death rate exceeds that of females, and the male excess in dying is
much greater with increases in age regardless of county types (Figure 4). The
age-specific sex mortality differentials
by level of urbanization and type of migration generally indicate that the effect
of urbanization and migration on agespecific mortality is not significant by
sex; but, the differences among county
groups increase with age. In general, for
men, all rural counties and large-urban
out-migration counties have higher
rates than the national average. For
women, large-urban out-migration
counties and rural out-migration counties have higher rates than the national
average. These age-specific patterns by
urbanization and migration level are the
same as those portrayed for ageadjusted rates.

Sex mortality ratios by level of urbanization and type of migration presented
in Figure 5 gradually increase with age
and then decrease after age 55 with a
peak occurring at ages 45-54. We compared ratios for age-specific groups to
see if the county group patterns are similar. For the middle-age group, the differences in sex mortality ratios among
county types are the greatest: largeurban in-migration counties have the
highest mortality ratio while largeurban out-migration counties have the
lowest ratio. In general, small-urban
out-migration counties and all inmigration counties have higher sex mortality ratios than the United States as a
whole throughout all age groups. In contrast, rural out-migration counties and
large-urban out-migration counties tend

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In the United States, the male death
rate from cardiovascular mortality is on
average three and one-half times higher
than the female rate. Counties with the
highest death rates for both males and

females are located largely in the southeastern part of the United States. Counties with the highest sex mortality ratio
are relatively scattered, but a major proportion is located in the central part of
the United States.

When sex mortality differentials are
investigated by level of urbanization and
type of migration, some interesting patterns emerge. Large urban counties
have the lowest sex mortality ratios
along with the highest mortality rates for
females and intermediate level rates for

males. In-migration counties exhibit
higher sex mortality ratios than outmigration counties accompanied by the
lowest mortality rates for both sexes.
When level of urbanization and type of
migration are considered together, the
sex mortality ratio is lowest for largeurban out-migration counties and highest for rural in-migration counties, with
levels of mortality varying for each sex
group. That sex differentials are primarily a function of female mortality is confirmed by the decomposition of sex differentials into sex-specific mortality.

The results clearly demonstrate that
sex mortality rates and differentials vary
by community type. But, it should be remembered that all counties grouped by
level of urbanization are composites of
rural and urban populations. For example, rural counties are a composite of
very diverse areas with urban population percentages ranging from zero to
less than 50. This creates the potential
for an “ecological fallacy.”” When small
urban and rural counties are compared,
it is possible that a difference in mortality between two county groups could be
mistakenly attributed to the rural population when it is actually due to higher
rates among the urban population in
one county group than in the other.
That is, one simply does not know
whether it is persons in the rura) or urban areas who have the highest mortality. Similarly, one does not know
whether it is in-migrants who have the
lowest risk of dying in one county group
rather than in another. Further research
will need to focus on the development of
more refined classifications of urbanization and migration.

Residence and migration per se may

tality and sex mortality ratios. The variables subsume a large set of more directly causal biological and behavioral
factors or the interaction of them. For
instance, males’ excessive deaths across
all age groups lends support to the idea
that females may be protected from
CVD by estrogen hormones. However,
the similar spatial clusterings of male
and female mortality also suggest the
importance of external conditions. It
also points to an instance where biological differences between the sexes play a
mediating role between environmental
factors and mortality. Because of the
prophylactic effects of estrogens, any

“environmental changes such as stress

levels, diet, etc., which accelerate atherosclerosis will work to the relative disadvantage of males. In any case, the specific relationships require further
development, since current knowledge
provides a limited theoretical basis for
explaining the observed variations.

The task completed in the first phase
of this research is a description of the extent and nature of sex differentials in
mortality. The next step is to identify
factors responsible for sex differentials
in mortality. If the factors responsible
for the experience of the areas with high
and low deaths can be identified, then
the application of this knowledge may
be used to reduce deaths and lower sex
mortality rates.
