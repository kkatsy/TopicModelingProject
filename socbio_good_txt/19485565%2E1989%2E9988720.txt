Ethnicity and Fertility in Liberia:

A Test of the Minority Group Status Hypothesis

ABSTRACT: This study examines the relationship between ethnicity and fertility in Liberia,
within the context of the minority group status hypothesis. The hypothesis argues that minority
group status exerts an independent effect on fertility, net of controls for socioeconomic and
demographic variables. Using a subsample of women from the 1974 Liberian census, the study
examines interethnic variations in fertility by comparing five ethnic minorities—Bassa, Vai,
Grebo, Kru, Kpelle—with the majority group, Americo-Liberian. With the possible exception
of Bassa women, the findings do not support the minority group status hypothesis. Instead, the
findings are more congruent with the alternative assimilationist hypothesis which argues that
when sociodemographic differences between majority and minority groups are controlled, their
fertility levels should converge. The implications of these findings are explored.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between ethnicity
and fertility in Liberia, within the context of the minority group status hypothesis. This hypothesis (Goldscheider
and Uhlenberg, 1969) argues that
minority-group status exerts an independent effect on fertility, even after
controlling for relevant sociodemographic differences between the majority and minority group(s). This hypothesis and the alternative assimilatonist
hypothesis have dominated explanations of majority-minority fertility differentials in the United States, but very
few, if any, studies have utilized these
hypotheses in explaining mayjorityminority fertility differentials in less developed settings like Liberia, where distinct majority and minority groups have
coexisted for more than a century. The
minority group status hypothesis will be
tested, using a subsample of 20,360
Liberian women. This subsample con
tains six of Liberia’s ethnic groups: the
majority group, Americo-Liberian, and
five ethnic minorities, Bassa, Vai,
Grebo, Kru, and Kpelle.

It is fairly well established that SubSaharan Africa’ has the highest desired
family size, birth rate, and annual population growth rate of any major world
region (Mott and Mott, 1980; Bongaarts
et al., 1984; Goliber, 1985). Moreover,
data suggest that, unlike other major
world regions, Sub-Saharan Africa has
yet to reach its peak in population
growth (Frank, 1983a). Obviously, such
a rapidly growing population is one of
the impediments to the social and economic development of the region. Although its current population of 2.1 million is relatively small, Liberia’s annual

'Sub-Saharan Africa, as used in this study, includes the countries of eastern, middle/central,
southern, and western Africa, but excludes the
eight countries that comprise North Africa.

population growth rate of 3.5 per cent is
very high and is typical of many SubSaharan African countries. This high
rate of population growth, resulting
mainly from declining mortality and
prevailing high fertility, is a cause for
concern, particularly in light of Liberia’s
continuing negative growth in GNP”.

While Bongaart et al. (1984) and
Frank (1983b) have shown that nearly
all of the variations in fertility in SubSaharan African can be accounted for
by three proximate determinants—
namely, lactational amenorrhea, postpartum sexual abstinence, and pathological sterility—much less is known
about how the institutional, cultural,
and material environment impinge on
these proximate determinants to influence the fertility outcomes. This
study attempts to increase our understanding of how the cultural factor ethnicity (more specifically, minoritygroup status) indirectly affects fertility
in Liberia. In other words, the study focuses on the institutional and cultural
contexts in which reproductive behavior
takes place.

Liberia provides an ideal setting for
studying ethnic fertility differentials because the grossly uneven development
of the country, with the coastal region
much more developed than the hinterland (Liberia, 1983), means that the various ethnic groups are differentially exposed to modernizing influences such as
education, urbanization, modern medicine, and Christianity. Thus, with in
Liberia experienced a high rate of growth in
GNP between 1967 and 1970, averaging about 7
per cent per annum. This rate of growth declined
to an average of 4.8 per cent between 1971 and
1974. Liberia’s sensitive export-based economy
suffered after 1974, registering negative GNP
growth of 4.2 per cent in 1975, due primarily to the
recession and slow recovery in Western Europe
and the United States (see RAPID, 1974).

creasing modernization, the decisions
that couples make regarding the number and timing of births will depend not
only on the influence that an ethnic subculture may have on them, but also on
the extent of their involvement in modern institutions. Gibbs (1963) finds ethnic differences in marital instability in
Liberia. Elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, ethnic differences have been noted
not only in the duration of postpartum
sexual abstinence (Romaniuk, 1980;
Caldwell and Caldwell, 1977) and in
pathological sterility (Podlewski, 1975;
Romaniuk, 1980), but also in fertility
(see, for example, Gaisie, 1972; Devis,
1973; Clignet and Sween, 1978).

Clearly, a knowledge of how ethnicity/minority-group status affects fertility is important for fully understanding population dynamics and trends in
Sub-Saharan African countries like Liberia. Moreover, a consideration of the
magnitude, direction, and context in
which ethnicity influences fertility facilitates the formulation of a population
policy that is better suited to the conditions affecting the behavior of the different ethnic groups.

HISTORICAL, ETHNOGRAPHIC,
AND DEMOGRAPHIC
BACKGROUND

The modern history of Liberia began
in 1821 when freed slaves from the
United States, under the auspices of the
American Colonization Society, landed
on Providence Island in what was to become Monrovia, Liberia. Constant
threats and territorial encroachments
from the neighboring colonial powers—
Britain (in Sierra Leone) and France (in
Guinea and Ivory Coast)—led the AfroAmerican settlers to declare Liberia an
independent republic in 1847.

The population of Liberia is ethnically diverse. But, the 18 major ethnic
groups and several smaller ones can be
dichotomized into the Americo-Liberians and non-Americo-Liberians (or indigenous Liberians). The AmericoLiberians, who, up until 1980° constituted the majority group in Liberia are
the descendants of freed AfroAmericans, Afro-Caribbeans, and
wn about 5,000 Africans who were rescued
© from slave ships bound for the New
5 World between 1845 and 1862. Compee tition for land, trade routes, and labor
5 led to numerous conflicts between the
A two groups. However, the superior orS ganization and military power of the
+ Americo-Liberians, with occasional as“ sistance from the United States, pro% vided them a clear military superiority
'§ (see Akpan, 1986, 1987; Holsoe, 1971;
= D’Azevedo, 1969, 1970, 1970-71; SulS livan, 1988). Thus, from 1847 to around
1964, the Americo-Liberians dominated
> the indigenous groups through a system
‘% of “indirect rule” that has been charac& terized as caste-like in nature (Fraenkel,
5 1964; Liebenow, 1987) and colonial in
>, character (Akpan, 1973).

The dominant Americo-Liberians set
3 the standard for culture and maintain a
< distinct identity. They generally speak
Z English, dress like Westerners, are
Q Christians, marry monogamously, own
land individually, and occupy a higher
socioeconomic status than the indigenous Liberians as a group (Clower et al.,

3The Americo-Liberian-dominated government was overthrown in a military coup d’etat
staged by noncommissioned indigenous Liberian
army Officers on April 12, 1980. This coup brought
to an end 133 years of Americo-Liberian rule.
However, it is important to remember that the
coup d’etat was basically a military takeover of political power and not a cultural revolution or radical restructuring of the country’s basic social institutions and values.

1964; Liebenow, 1987). While there
may have been a few exceptions, upward social mobility by indigenous ethnic group members up until 1980 required substantial assimilation into
Americo-Liberian subculture. The assimilation process involved, among
other things, the adoption of a Western
name, dress, folkways, the Christian religion, some formal education, and
sometimes marriage into an AmericoLiberian family. The Americo-Liberian
family, Christian missionary schools/
churches, the Masonic Craft, and voluntary associations were instrumental in
the assimilation process (see Fraenkel,
1964; Hlope, 1979; Liebenow, 1987), It
is important to note that while the adoption of Americo-Liberian subculture
was a necessary condition for upward
social mobility and possible assimilation, it was not always a sufficient condition.

The various indigenous ethnic
groups, who migrated to Liberia from
the Western Sudanic Empires between
1300 and 1800 (see Liebenow, 1987),
participate in what may be generally referred to as an African culture. In terms
of their marriage and family system, the
indigenous groups are generally patrilineal, largely polygynous with bride
wealth and/or bride service. They generally breastfeed their children and observe postpartum sexual abstinence in
varying durations. They are probably
more pronatalistic/familistic than the
Americo-Liberians. The pronatalism
among indigenous African groups like
those in Liberia stems partly from the
prevailing high infant mortality and also
from the emphasis on “wealth in people” rather than wealth in private property (Bledsoe, 1980). Generally, land is
more available and communally owned
in less modernized areas of Africa. As

such, land ownership may not be as important an indicator of social position as
the control that one has over people.
Hence, control over women, the children they reproduce, and the single men
that daughters lure into marriage is important for labor requirements, old-age
security, political following, and the establishment of important alliances
(Bledsoe, 1980). However, the general
portrait of the indigenous Liberians presented here should not convey the impression that they constitute a homogeneous group. Clearly, there are
socioeconomic and subcultural differences among the indigenous Liberians.

The sociodemographic profile of Liberia is typical of a developing country
and in many ways mirrors the larger picture in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, in 1974, life expectancy at birth was
46 and 49 years for men and women, respectively; the crude birth and death
rates were 49 and 16 per 1,000 population, respectively; infant mortality rates
were 174 and 152 per 1,000 births for Liberian males and females, respectively;
and the literacy rate was 30 and 12 per
cent for men and women ten years and
older, respectively (Campbell, 1982).
Liberia has a young population (median
age of 19.3 years) with a high total dependency ratio (806 persons supported
by 1,000 workers in 1974), that is growing at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent
(Conteh, 1988).

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

Two major explanations dominate
studies of majority/minority group status and fertility in the United States.
One of these, the “‘assimilationist” hypothesis, argues that observed differences in the fertility of majority and minority groups are due largely to social,

Social Biology

economic, and demographic differences

between the two groups. Hence, when

sociodemographic differences are con
trolled, the fertility of majority and mi
nority groups should converge or be
come very similar (Thomlinson, 1965;

Farley, 1966; Sly, 1970; Presser, 1971).

The second, the “minority group status”

hypothesis, argues that minority group

Status exerts an independent

effect on fertility, even after controlling
for sociodemographic differences between the two groups (Goldscheider
and Uhlenberg, 1969). Goldscheider
and Uhlenberg (1969) further point out

that in the absence of a pronatalist ideol
ogy, the insecurities and marginality as
sociated with a desire for upward social
mobility may depress minority fertility
below that of the majority group.

While few studies (Lee and Lee,
1959; Sly, 1970; Stahura and Stahura,
1975) provide empirical support for the
assimilationist hypothesis, the majority
of studies using these hypotheses provide empirical support for the minority
group status hypothesis (see Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969; Marshall
and Sinott, 1971; Kennedy, 1973; Roberts and Lee, 1974; Bean and Wood,
1974; Ritchey, 1975; Jiobu and Marshall, 1977; Tan, 1981).

Which of the two hypotheses—the
assimilationist or minority group
status—provides a better explanation
for the Liberian data? For an answer,
one has to examine how majority/
minority group differences in sociodemographic and cultural practices directly or indirectly affect the proximate
determinants of fertility in Liberia,
namely, breastfeeding, postpartum abstinence, and pathological sterility.

One would expect the more modernized Americo-Liberian women to have
lower fertility than the less modernized

minority group women, since various indicators of modernization have been
shown to depress fertility. However,
findings showing that incipient modernization initially increases fertility (Nag,
1980; Romaniuk, 1980) should limit the
extent to which their fertility is lower
than that of minority group women.
While the pronatalism/familism of
minority-group women should raise
their fertility above that of the majority
group, the lower socioeconomic position generally expected of minority
group women and the higher infant
mortality and pathological sterility that
such position implies should limit the extent of such fertility increase. Moreover,
the prevalence of such fertilityinhibiting cultural practices as breastfeeding, postpartum abstinence, and
polygyny among minority women
should also work to depress their fertility below desired levels. In short, if the
structural assimilation of minoritygroup women results in their abandonment or substantial relaxation of such
fertility-inhibiting, cultural practices,
then their fertility level should be similar
to that of the Americo-Liberians. However, if the minority group women retain these cultural practices after their
structural assimilation, it is likely that
their fertility level will be different from
and perhaps lower than that of the majority Americo-Liberians, in which
case, majority and minority fertility will
reflect the pattern predicted by the
minority-group-status hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study come from a
subsample of women, aged 15 to 49
years, taken from a 10 per cent sample
of the 1974 Liberian census. To control
for nativity, we restrict the analysis to

Fertility in Liberia 71

native-born Liberian citizens. The dependent variable is fertility, and the independent variable is ethnicity. Education, work status, occupation, residence
background, marital status, age, and
age squared are used as control variables. With minor modifications, the operational definitions of the variables are
as follows, based largely on the 1974
Census of Population and Housing of
Liberia (1977).

The dependent variable, fertility, is
measured in terms of children ever born
to women ten years of age and over.

Ethnicity reflects a self-reporting of
one’s ethnic group. In this study, we replace the ethnic category, “No Tribal
Affiliation’? with Americo-Liberian,
since the overwhelming majority of
native-born Liberians with no tribal affiliation are Americo-Liberians. Furthermore, the term ethnicity (rather
than tribe) is used in this study to reflect
changes made in the 1984 census. In Liberia, ethnicity denotes a group sharing
a common language, some common geographic origin, and some cultural traditions defined in general terms (see Roberts, 1964; Liebenow, 1987).
Sociologically, Americo-Liberians,
comprising only about 3 per cent of the
population, constituted the majority
group up to 1980, because they controlled a greater share of social, economic, and political power. By contrast,
the various indigenous ethnic groups
constituted the minority, in that they enjoyed a disproportionately smaller share
of wealth, power, and prestige (see,
Fraenkel, 1964; Hlope, 1979; Akpan,
1973; Liebenow, 1987).

Education is measured in terms of
number of years of formal schooling
completed. In the analysis that follows,
the answer categories are regrouped
into (1) No Grade (zero years of schoolDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

ing completed); (2) Primary (1 to 8 years
of schooling completed); (3) High
School (9 to 12 years of schooling completed); and (4) College and Above (13
to 16+ years of schooling completed).

The variable work status is a combination of work status and economic activity, which permits the inclusion of
women who are out of the labor force.

Occupation refers to the kind of work
a person did most of the time during the
12 months preceding the census date.
The seven category International Standard Classification of Occupation (International Labor Office, 1969) is used to
regroup the occupations.

The two attributes of residence background are rural and urban with a rural
locality having fewer than 2,000 inhabitants. However, localities with civic
amenities like a school, hospital, electricity, and potable water are classified
as urban, even if they have fewer than
2,000 inhabitants. Likewise, localities
under the remainder of clan‘ are considered rural, even though the total population is over 2,000.

Marital status is classified into four
subcategories: (1) Never married, (2)
Married, (3) Widowed, and (4) Divorced/separated.

Finally, age is measured in completed
years, referring to a respondent’s age on
his/her last birthday at the time of the
census. Estimates of age were made for
respondents who did not know their exact age, using prevailing practices such
as number of times annual crops were
sown since the occurrence of an important event (see 1974 Census of Population and Housing of Liberia, 1977, for

Population and Housing Census of Liberia, 1977).

detailed operational definitions). An
age-squared variable is included to take
account of the curvilinear relationship
between age and fertility. Since age and
age squared are likely to be highly collinear, a constant (equal to the mean
age) is subtracted first, before squaring.
This procedure reduces the multicollinearity between the two variables. Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA), a
variant of multiple regression, is used to
analyze the data, which are mostly nominally measured (see Andrews et al.,
1973 for a discussion of MCA).

The analysis proceeds in the following order. First, we present a general description of the sample. Next, we examine the relationship between education
and fertility for each ethnic group to see
if the pattern of relationship is the same
within each group. In other words, there
should be no statistical interaction between ethnic group membership and education in their effect on fertility (see
Bean and Marcum, 1978). Sample
shrinkage and space limitation preclude
an examination of the relationship between fertility and other socioeconomic
characteristics for each group.

If there are no significant ethnic differences in the education-fertility relationship, then we will examine the reJationship between majority/minority
group status and fertility, while controlling for education and other sociodemographic variables. If significant ethnic
fertility differences persist after introducing controls, then these differences
provide evidence supporting a majority/
minority fertility differential, net of sociodemographic characteristics. If ethnic fertility differentials are substantially
reduced after introducing controls, then
this reduction provides evidence supporting the assimilationist hypothesis.

In examining ethnic fertility, we use

Vol. 36, No. 1~2

the fertility of the majority AmericoLiberian as a baseline. Also, we use individual ethnic groups rather than a dichotomous majority/minority designation because increased precision of
group definition yields greater predictive power (Roberts and Lee, 1974).

RESULTS

Without introducing any controls
into the relationship, we find (Table 1)
that the majority Americo-Liberians,
compared with each of the minority
groups, are more educated, more likely
to work in professional, technical, and
administrative occupations, are more
urbanized, have a slightly higher incidence of marital instability (divorce/
separation), a lower mean fertility, less
experience of child mortality, and have
a very low incidence of involuntary sterility, defined as having had no births by
age 45 to 49 (see Frank, 1983b). The
predominantly hinterland Kpelle women are polar opposites to the AmericoLiberian women in these characteristics,
with the coastal minority groups somewhere in-between but much closer to
the Kpelle than to the AmericoLiberians.

With the exception of Vai women, infertility is quite high among the minority
groups, whether one compares their levels to the 3 per cent that Frank (1983)
uses as a benchmark of childlessness for
natural fertility populations in developing countries or the 5 per cent Belsey
(1976) uses. High as the incidence of infertility is, it could in fact be much
higher, if one takes into account the possibility of underreporting. In highly
pronatalist/familistic societies like Liberia, there is considerable stigma associated with infertility. The incidence of infertility appears to be widespread

Fertility in Liberia 73

throughout the country. Among the five
minorities in our sample, 13 per cent of
those in urban areas, compared to 10.8
per cent in rural areas, report no births
by age 45 to 49.

In summary, we find that the majority Americo-Liberian women Occupy a
higher socioeconomic status than
women of the minority groups, experiences less child mortality, have a lower
incidence of infertility, and have a lower
mean fertility. We now examine the relationship between education and fertility for each of the ethnic groups.

To facilitate interpretation, in the tables that follow the deviation of births
from the grand mean has been added to
or subtracted from the grand mean for
each ethnic group (Table 2) or regional
background (Table 3), which directly
gives the mean number of children ever
born.

Where data exist, we find that the
pattern of relationship between education and fertility (Table 2) is very similar
for each ethnic group. That is, with few
exceptions, the adjusted mean fertility
shows that increasing education, especially college and beyond, has a depressing effect on fertility for all groups.
While college education tends to reduce
fertility, women with a little education
(primary schooling) generally tend to
have a higher fertility than women with
no formal schooling (no grade). Such a
pattern suggests that women with a little
education are more likely to abandon or
substantially relax such traditional
fertility-inhibiting practices as breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence,
without resorting to the use of effective
contraceptives (see Bongaarts et al.,
1984). In short, the pattern of
education-fertility relationship in Table
2 suggests no significant interaction effect.

justed means (where relevant sociodemographic variables have been controlled). The possible exception to this
pattern is the fertility of Bassa women
which is lower than that of the dominant
group and the other minority groups, especially in the total sample and among
rural women.

In short, with the possible exception
of Bassa women, the small majorityminority fertility differentials can
largely be accounted for by differences
in the socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics of these women, Clearly,
these findings do not provide empirical
support for the minority-group~status
hypothesis. On the contrary, they tend
to be more consistent with the assimilationist hypothesis.

With the exception of Bassa women,
there is substantial convergence in
majority-minority group fertility when
relevant sociodemographic variables
are statistically controlled. An examination of the magnitude of the eta coefficient suggests a weak relationship between majority-minority group status
{or ethnicity) and fertility in Liberia.
The effect of minority group status on
fertility is slightly stronger among rural
women than among urban women (0.07
vs. 0.05). The model accounts for a
modest percentage (34 per cent) of the
variance in the dependent variable, fertility, and these findings are statistically
significant at the 0.05 level of significance orlower.

These findings may be interpreted as
suggesting that with respect to fertility
behavior in the groups under study, the
Structural assimilation of minority
groups seems to result in their cultural
assimilation vis-a-vis the majority
Americo-Libenians. Although this study
lacks data on breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence, it seems reasonable to

assume that increasing education and
the adoption of modern attitudes and
values bring about an erosion in breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence.
Viewed within the broader context of
Liberian society, the findings suggest
that the adoption of monogamy, neolocal residence, Christianity, and the nuclear family by educated minority-group
women tends to make them quite similar to the majority Americo-Liberian
women in these respects. Such similarity
in marriage and family values and practices translates into similarity in fertility
behavior.

The findings of other studies tend to
buttress this line of reasoning. In a study
of the breastfeeding habits of women in
four urban areas in Liberia, David
(1987) finds that more educated women,
working in the formal sector of the economy, are less likely to breastfeed their
children. David (1987) suggests that the
decline in breastfeeding among educated urban women may be related in
part to the Western perception of the female breast as a symbol of sexuality. As
such, women become concerned about
the sagging of the breasts which results
from prolonged breastfeeding. Other
studies of infant feeding practices in less
developed countries, especially those in
Sub-Saharan Africa, generally show a
negative relationship between female
education and breastfeeding (Jarosz,
1985; Oni, 1985; Franklin et al., 1983;
Nag 1980; Romaniuk 1978). Darjohn
(1958) also finds that polygyneously
married women are more likely to observe postpartum abstinence, since their
husbands can cohabit with other wives
during the period of abstinence. It is not
clearly known why Bassa women have a
slightly lower fertility than the other
groups.

Social Biology

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The results of the analysis provide
tentative answers to the two major questions that the study addresses. With respect to the first question concerning the
effect of minority-group status on fertility, the findings show that minoritygroup status has a rather weak effect on
fertility, implying that it is not highly important as a determinant of fertility differentials.

Secondly, the findings of this study do
not provide empirical support for the
minority-group-status hypothesis. With
the possible exception of Bassa women,
the findings seem to be more congruent
with the assimilationist hypothesis,
which argues that when sociodemographic differences between majority
and minority groups are controlled,
their fertility should converge.

While the cross-sectional nature of
these data and the limited number of
variables and ethnic groups considered
do not provide sound basis for suggesting policies, one can speculate on some
of the wider implication of these findings. First, the findings imply that increasing modernization, especially the
expansion of education and medical
facilities/services for combating high
infant/child mortality and involuntary
sterility, may serve the long-term goal of
reducing fertility in Liberia. The fact
that a college education has a depressing effect on fertility for all groups in this
study is an encouraging sign. However,
while Americo-Liberian women may be
at their peak in fertility performance (in
light of their low incidences of child
mortality and involuntary sterility), the
high incidences of child mortality and involuntary sterility among minority
group women may be frustrating their

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

efforts at achieving peak performance in
fertility. Unless these sources of frustration are alleviated, these women may resist any efforts aimed at reducing their
fertility.

Secondly, to the extent that minoritygroup women continue to view Americo-Liberian women as role models for
their own behavior, especially fertilityrelated behavior, Americo-Liberian
women may play an important role in
any future programs designed to reduce
fertility. The successful adoption of low
fertility values by minority-group
women may enable them to serve as catalysts for diffusing such values throughout the population, particularly among
educated minority women.

Finally, the findings of this study
demonstrate the usefulness of explanatory models like the minority-group—
status and assimilationist hypotheses in
studying majority-minority fertility in a
developing country like Liberia. Clearly, more studies along this line, espe
Fertility in Liberia

79

cially ones involving different ethnic minority groups in Liberia, are needed. In
addition to the variables considered in
this study, future studies should include
the measures and impacts of cultural
practices like breastfeeding, postpartum
abstinence, polygyny, and age at marriage and first birth.
