Voluntary and Involuntary Childlessness in the

United States, 1955-1973

ABSTRACT: Since the early 1970s, considerable attention has been given to U.S. trends in childlessness. Studies have shown that childlessness rates have been increasing in recent years; many
believe that the bulk of the increase has been due to increases in voluntary childlessness. However, there have been few methodological and empirical analyses of trends in voluntary and
involuntary childlessness. This paper has two objectives: to develop two procedures for measuring voluntary and involuntary childlessness with fertility survey data; and to apply empirically
these approaches to five fertility surveys conducted between 1955 and 1973.

Until the mid-1970’s, childlessness,
its measurement and trends, received
only modest attention by sociologists,
psychologists, demographers, and marriage and family life scholars. The modest attention given childlessness may
have resulted from the general lack of
approval afforded the childless couple.
The norms relating to marriage and procreation have tended to be pervasive
and pronatalist. Married persons are expected to have children, should want to
have children, and should rejoice at the
prospect of having children (Veevers,
1973a). For the most part, childlessness
is neither supported nor encouraged by
the society’s normative and value structure. Such a proscription is understandable in a sense because a total and complete incidence of childlessness would
obviously be dysfunctional for the society’s replacement and ultimate survival
(Poston, 1974, p. 297). The childed state
is thus valued in its own right (Griffith,
1973), and those who remain without
children often experience severe negative sanctions (Veevers, 1973b; Blake,
1974, esp. pp. 36-37).

Since about 1975, however, increasing attention has been given to childlessness, particularly that portion of the
phenomenon due to voluntary factors.
A growing literature has developed, on
childlessness trends, characteristics of
childless women (and couples), and the
consequences of childlessness. And the
fact that general rates of childlessness
have been increasing in the United
States over about the same period of
time that their analyses have been undertaken is probably not coincidental.
Moreover, many have been arguing that
the 1960’s were a decade of change in
the U.S. with respect to contraceptive
technology, sexual and family norms,
and female work patterns and preferences (Bumpass, 1973; Westoff, 1972;
Presser and Bumpass, 1972; Jones and
Westoff, 1972; Westoff, 1976). It has
been claimed that these changes have
begun to make possible the eventual realization of equal opportunity between
the sexes because nonfamilial roles for
females are becoming a realistic option
to motherhood.

If the above arguments are true, they

290

 
Vol. 30, No. 3

point to an increasing need for a thorough and detailed methodological and
empirical analysis of trends in voluntary
and involuntary childlessness. If indeed
voluntary childlessness is emerging as an
acceptable lifestyle, the phenomenon
requires careful examination and analysis. The major objectives of this paper,
therefore, are two: to develop procedures for measuring voluntary and involuntary childlessness with fertility surae = vey data; and to apply empirically these
a approaches to five fertility surveys con9 ducted between 1955 and 1973.
€ Before addressing these concerns, we
® provide a baseline for our discussions by
x reviewing general trends in rates of overS, all childlessness, and in voluntary and in<; voluntary childlessness, in the United
— States since the turn of the century.

TRENDS IN CHILDLESSNESS

The periods for which census data on
4 childlessness, we turn next to a brief
pare available are irregularly spaced over
time, and most of the observations per2 tain to the periods since 1960. In Table 1
— we have assembled rates of childlessness
pior ever married U.S. women for 17
3 time periods from 1910 to 1981. The in3 formation demonstrates rather clearly

< that the incidence of childlessness in the
2 United States has not been without flucA tuations (see Gustavus and Henley,
1971, and Hastings and Robinson, 1974,
for similar statements). The rate of
childlessness increased between 1910
and 1940, and from then until 1965 experienced a decline. In the past 16 years
the rates have varied somewhat irregularly, although by 1981 there had been a
net increase of 4.4 percentage points.
Since 1965, the phenomenon has generally been increasing after an extended
period of prolonged decline.

Given these very general trends in
childlessness, we turn next to a brief
consideration of patterns of voluntary
and involuntary childlessness in the
United States. Our major question is
whether the categories of childlessness
have also varied over time.

There appear to be three rather distinct phases of voluntary-involuntary
childlessness occurring since the 1920’s
in the United States. In the first phase,
from the 1920’s until 1940, although
more than half of the childlessness occurring was typically involuntary, a
good percentage of couples were having
no children by choice. Data from the Indianapolis Study, for example permit
the conclusion that during 1927-41,
more than 40 per cent of the childless
couples studied reported that they chose
to have no children and were regular users Of contraception. Specifically, the
authors developed “median estimates of

292

42.1 per cent for voluntary [childlessness]. . . and 57.9 per cent for physiological causes [i.e., involuntary childlessness] (Whelpton and Kiser, 1950,
Vol. 2, p. 335).

These general findings are roughly in
line with an earlier report of Lorimer
and Osborn (1934) suggesting that between 25 and 40 per cent of a group of
childless women studied in the 1920's
might be described as voluntarily childless. Moreover, in an analysis of women
in New York City during the fall and
winter of 1935-1936, Kiser noted that
over 75 per cent of the “never-pregnant
women reported that neither they nor
their husbands had ever done anything
since marriage to prevent conception. ... Furthermore, two-thirds of
the never-pregnant women reported
that they were disappointed in their
childless condition, and 57 per cent declared that they had, in the past, consulted a physician to ascertain why they
could not have a child” (Kiser, 1939, p.
14). Nevertheless, at least 25 per cent of
them could be classified as voluntarily
childless.

Phase Two of the voluntaryinvoluntary childlessness trends in the
United States began after World War II
and was characterized by an overall reduction in childlessness, with little if any
of thie remaining childlessness due to
voluntary factors. Among women interviewed in the 1955 growth of American
Families Study (known also as GAF-T),
Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell
(1959) found first that childlessness had
declined significantly since the early
1940’s, and that “‘childlessness now
results mainly from fecundity impairments. Few of our couples with no fecundity impairment will be voluntarily
childless, that is, will deliberately avoid
having any children throughout their

Poston and Kramer

Social Biology

 

married life” (Freedman et al., 1959, p.
46). For example, of the 51 childless
couples in GAF-I who were married 15
years or longer, only 2 of them were fecund.

Phase Two continued beyond 1955,
so that the same phenomena (the very
low incidence of childlessness and the
virtual absence of voluntary childlessness) were found by Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson in the 1960 Growth
of American Families study (known also
as GAF-II). They noted that nearly all
American couples in the childbearing
ages demonstrated “‘a strong aversion to
childlessness. .. . The proportion of
young couples who will remain childless
throughout marriage . . . will probably
be in the neighborhood of 6 to 8 per cent
. .. [and that] the major cause of this
childlessness is the existence of fecundity impairments. Voluntary childlessness is nearly extinct” (Whelpton et al.,
1966, pp. 162-163).

Phase Three began in the 1960’s and
is characterized generally by increases in
overall childlessness, as well as by increases in voluntary childlessness. The
increases in the overall rates of childlessness are evident in the data presented
earlier in Table 1. And the increases in
voluntary childlessness during this
phase (the 1960’s) have been documented in a number of studies. In an
analysis of 1961 Canadian census data,
Veevers (1972) estimated that close to
half of the childlessness occurring to
women over the age of 30 may have
been voluntary. In a similar vein, Rao’s
(1974) analysis of fertility data collected
from Rhode Island women during the
late 1960’s suggested that among the
childless women aged 30-49 living with
their husbands, half of them were voluntarily childless. In still another analysis
(Waller et al., 1973), it was suggested
 

Vol. 30, No. 3

that families without children were comprised of couples who were biologically
fertile, and couples who were biologically or deliberately sterile. While the
study did not employ a voluntaryinvoluntary dichotomy in conceptualizing childlessness, it demonstrated that
childlessness today is no longer the sole
result of involuntary factors. And in a
study based on data for white women
collected in the 1965 National Fertility
— Survey, Poston (1976) examined the disOo , : :
‘ tributions of childless women by volun6 tary and involuntary categories. He esti5 mated that over 61 per cent of women
with no children who were not anticipat0 ing having children were voluntarily
5 childless (Poston, 1976, Table 1).
<: Most studies of childlessness in the
~ 1960’s reported significant increases in
= the voluntary category during this time
period. Indeed, data gathered from a
= variety of sources allow one to conclude
S with Veevers that “it seems premature
‘6 to presume, as Tomasson (1966, p. 328)
£ and others have, that a ‘virtual disape pearance of deliberate childlessness has
‘& already occurred’ ” (Veevers, 1972, p.
~, 273). Such a prognosis perhaps would
& have been appropriate for the time peri8 od after World War II through most of
3 the 1950’s (Phase Two above), but
a clearly not for the period of the 1960’s to
© the present (Phase Three). And the
work of DeJong and Sell (1977) of
changes in childlessness in the United
States supports this general interpretation. Specifically, they note that the increases in childlessness in the 1960’s are
not “attributable primarily to changes in
involuntary (i.e., biological, disease)
factors” (DeJong and Sell, 1977, p.
140).
Despite the recognition, indeed, the
conviction among some scholars, that
voluntary childlessness has become the

Voluntary and Involuntary Childlessness

 

293

prevalent form of the phenomenon in
recent years, few have attempted directly to establish procedures for drawing empirical distinctions between the
voluntary and involuntary categories.
Some have endeavored to estimate the
extent of sterility and subfecundity
among very old women (the 1901-10
birth cohort in the U.S.) on the basis of
retrospective reproductive histories
(Ridley et al., 1979; Ridley and Dawson, 1980). Others have used more
mathematically derived procedures in
an attempt to analyze the voluntary and
involuntary parameters (Dietz, 1979;
Waller et al., 1973). Still others have
used U.S. and Canadian census data to
estimate indirectly the incidence of voluntary childlessness (Veevers, 1972;
Poston, 1974, Wolowyna, 1977). As
best as we can ascertain, except for the
above mentioned paper by Poston
(1976), no childlessness investigations
have ventured to identify directly the actual distributions of voluntary and involuntary childlessness among married
women on the basis of current information contained in national fertility surveys. Such is the first objective of this

paper.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two PROCEDURES FOR SEPARATING
VOLUNTARY FROM INVOLUNTARY
CHILDLESSNESS

Here, we describe the development
and implementation of measurement
strategies for separating childlessness
into voluntary and involuntary categories. We then, in the next section, apply
these methodologies to five fertility surveys conducted in the United States between 1955 and 1973 in an attempt to ascertain levels and changes over time in
types of childlessness.

There are at least two models for distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary childlessness: a cognitive
model and a behavioral model. These
alternative perspectives define voluntary and involuntary childlessness on the
basis of either one’s knowledge of fecundity or one’s behavior. The two distinctions are described below.

In attempting to separate various categories of childlessness, one begins with
a population of childless women who
are not pregnant. We omit childless
women who were pregnant at the time
of the survey because their accurate categorization is ambiguous, if not impossible. For example, should childless
women who are pregnant be classified as
childless or childed? Working thus with
childless women who were not pregnant, we then ascertain their future fertility intentions. Those who had no children at the time of ‘interview but
intended to have children in the future
are set aside as temporarily childless.

It is at this point that the distinction
between the behavioral and cognitive
approaches becomes apparent. We
have available for analysis a population
of childless women who were not pregnant and who did not plan to have children in the future. But there are at least
two ways to determine whether or not
their childlessness can be designated
voluntary. One procedure involves examining their contraceptive behavior. If
a childless woman who did not intend to
have children in the future was contracepting, then one could assume that she
was choosing of her own volition not to
have children in the future. If a childless
woman was not contracepting, but did
not intend to have children in the future,
one cannot immediately conclude that
she was involuntarily childless. She
might not have been contracepting be

cause she (or her husband) were sterilized for contraceptive reasons. Thus the
noncontracepting woman with no operation, and the one who was sterilized but
not for contraceptive reasons, are both
assumed to be involuntarily childless.
And, to the voluntarily childless woman
who was so defined because of her contracepting behavior must now be added
another type of voluntarily childless
women, the noncontracepting woman
who had (or her husband had) had a
sterilization question principally for
contraceptive reasons. This is the line of
reasoning that characterizes the behavioral approach for distinguishing voluntarily from involuntarily childless
women.

Another procedure involves inquiring about the woman’s knowledge of her
fecundity. If a woman with no children
who was not pregnant at interview time
knew that she was capable of having
children, yet planned to have none in
the future, we assume she was voluntarily childless. On the other hand, if a
woman with no children who was not
pregnant knew that she was unable to
have children in the future, she is assumed to be involuntarily childless, as
long as her inability to conceive does not
stem from a sterilizing operation performed for contraceptive reasons. This
second approach distinguishes between
involuntarily and voluntarily childless
wives on the basis of their knowledge of
their fecundity or sterility, and not their
contraception behavior. This distinction
characterizes the major differences between the behavioral and cognitive approaches to separating voluntarily from
involuntarily childless women. Figure 1
portrays these basic two approaches.

These categories of childlessness, of
course, are plagued with reliability and
validity problems. Some of the voLuN 

Vol. 30, No. 3

TARILY CHILDLESS may be biologically incapable of having children. But since
many of them have likely been contracepting so that they would not have children (this would especially be the case if
they were defined on the basis of the behavioral approach), they would never
have become aware of their biological
sterility or subfecundity. They would
thus be defining themselves as vOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS when in actuality they
‘Owere INVOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS. Howsever, their definition of their childlessSness as voluntary warrants to some exEtent classifying them as voluntary. W. I.
Thomas’ observation that if persons
O« define situations as real, they are real
Sin their consequences,” (cited in Mer“ton, 1957, p. 421) would appear to be
—applicable in this context.
© Inasimilar vein many of the INVOLUNSTARILY CHILDLESS may not define as
‘<problematic their presumed biological
Sincapability to produce children. They
“smay well have intended in the first place
to have no children, and then either dis“covered they were biologically incapa‘bly of doing so anyway or become sterile
~through an operation not performed
solely for contraceptive reasons. Thus,
‘galthough they are not now able to have
‘children, they may not have been in‘clined to have children anyway.
& The TEMPORARILY CHILDLESS are even
Amore enigmatic. They will eventually
join the ranks of the CHILDED, VOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS, OF INVOLUNTARILY CHILD
LEss groups. If they have a child, as they
intend, they become CHILDED. But since
they have been childless to the date of
the interview, and likely have been using some form of contraception to remain childless, they may not know if
they are biologically capable of having
children. When they finally decide to
have their children, they may be unable

gan|

295

to conceive, and would thus become INVOLUNTARILY CHILDLEss. Another possibility is that the TEMPORARILY CHILDLESS
will continue to postpone having their
first child, maintaining the “‘advantages” of their childless lifestyles. The
study of voluntarily childless wives by
Veevers (1973b) is especially applicable
here. She reports that two-thirds of the
childless women in her sample did not
decide on childlessness prior to marriage, but “‘remained childless as a result
of decisions to postpone having children
until some future time, a future which
never came” (Veevers, 19735, p. 359).
If this is the experience of the TEMPORARILY CHILDLESS in the sample, many of
them would eventually join the ranks of
the VOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS.

There are only a few of the problems
inherent in any strategy to identify various categories of childless wives with
data from fertility surveys. The differences among the various subpopulations
of childless wives are manifold, and as
Veevers (1972) has observed, the application of these distinctions in the real
world is not without difficulty. “In order
to place individuals in the appropriate
category, it is necessary to know details
concerning not only their health, but
also their innermost motivations and aspirations. Such data can be gleaned only
in intensive personal interviews and are
not readily available from representative samples of large populations”’
(Veevers, 1972, p. 266).

Nevertheless, it is felt here that despite the conceptual and methodological
liabilities just discussed, the employment of these dimensions of childlessness provides important information.
Since we know little about the extent to
which these categories of childlessness
exist in the U.S., at the very worst these
procedures and their application to

296

U.S. surveys should provide tentative
approximations.

The above are two alternative strategies for separating the phenomenon of
childlessness into voluntary and involuntary categories. In the next section we
apply both alternative strategies to data
from fertility surveys conducted in 1955,
1960, 1965, 1970, and 1973.

APPLYING THE TWo CHILDLESSNESS
SEPARATION PROCEDURES TO FIVE
FERTILITY SURVEYS

Five fertility surveys conducted between 1955 and 1973 provided the basic
data to be used in the empirical application of the two childlessness separation
procedures. The five surveys used are
the following: the 1955 Growth of
American Families study (known also as
GAF-I) (see Freedman, Whelpton and
Campbell, 1959, for further information); 1960 Growth of American Families Study (known also as GAF-II) (see
Whelpton et al., 1966, for additional information); the 1965 National Fertility
Survey (known also as the 1965 NFS)
(see Ryder and Westoff, 1971, for additional information); the 1970 National
Fertility Survey (known also as the 1970
NFS) (see Westoff and Ryder, 1977, for
additional information) and the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 1
(known also as NSFG-I) (see Pratt, 1977
for additional information and technical
documentation). All five surveys are
based on cross-sectional samples, and to
the best of our knowledge, no woman
was included in more than one of the
surveys.

Given the fact that the five surveys
were conducted over an eighteen-year
period and by different groups of investigators, one would not expect the variOus questions pertaining to pregnancy
status, fecundity, contraceptive prac

Social Biology

tice, fertility expectations, etc., to be
identical from one survey to the next.
Surprisingly, although there are many
differences between and among the sets
of questions, the similarities in question
form, content, and intention are indeed
remarkable. We have compared and
contrasted elsewhere (Poston and Kramer, 1981, pp. 32-37) the various questions from the five surveys which are
employed in developing the cognitive
and behavioral approaches. Limitations
of space preclude our presenting these
comparisons here. We are of the opinion, however, that the questions are
similar enough in the five surveys that
reliability issues are not a problem when
applying the two childlessness separation approaches in the various surveys.

To illustrate the actual application of
the two procedures, we draw now on
data from the 1973 National Survey of
Family Growth, Cycle 1. This is a survey
of 9,797 civilian noninstitutionalized
women living in the coterminous United
States, who are less than 45 years of age,
and either single with natural children
presently living in the household, currently married, or previously married.
The survey was directed and administered by the National Center for Health
Statistics over a period centering on
September 1973.

The cognitive approach to childlessness separation is portrayed in a decision tree in Figure 1. Using the data
from the 1973 NSFG, we begin with the
9,797 women in the study. The 3,933
nonwhite women are first excluded from
the analysis. Nonwhite respondents are
excluded due to their different trends in
childlessness when compared to whites
(Poston and Gotard, 1977). Also, the
350 women who were pregnant at the
time the interviews were conducted are
excluded because of the difficulty in

classifying them accurately. Remaining
for analysis are’5,514 women, 903 of
whom were childless. These 903 women
reported never having a live birth in response to the question, “Altogether,
how many babies have you had born to
you, including any who died very
young?”’

At this point, the temporarily childless women are Separated out by examining responses to the question, “‘Do
you and your husband intend to have
another baby?” More than two-thirds of
the women answered that they intended
to have a child; 257 women answered
they intended to have no children in the
future.

These 257 women who intended to
remain childless are then separated into
voluntarily childless and involuntarily
childless groups. Following the cognitive approach, reference is made to a
questionnaire item concerning fecundity. Those women who did not “have
any reason to believe it would be difficult or impossible for you or your husband to have a (another) baby” are classified as normally fecund. There are 113
women thus categorized. However, 144
women had reason to believe it would
be difficult or impossible to have a baby,
and they are designated sterile or subfecund. Of these, 19 had not had an operation; 125 women had had an operation
which resulted in their sterility, 23 of
whom had the operation for contraceptive reasons, and 102 not for contraceptive reasons.

The number of voluntarily childless
women, therefore, are identified by
adding the 113 normally fecund women
to the 23 sterile women who had an operation for contraceptive reasons, for a
total of 136 voluntarily childless women.
The number of involuntarily childless
women is determined by adding the 19

Poston and Kramer

Social Biology

sterile women who had not had an operation to the 102 sterile women who had
had an operation but not for contraceptive purposes, for a total of 121 involuntarily childless women.

After applying the cognitive approach of separating voluntary from involuntary childlessness to data from the
1973 National Survey of Family
Growth, we conclude that almost 72 per
cent of the more than 900 childless
women are temporarily childless, 15 per
cent are voluntarily childless, and 13 per
cent are involuntarily childless. We turn
next to an illustration of the behavioral
approach.

In the behavioral separation strategy,
temporarily childless women are identified in the same way as in the cognitive
procedure. The behavioral and cognitive approaches differ only in the manner used to separate permanently childless women into voluntary and
involuntary categories (see the bottom
part of Figure 1).

After identifying the 257 women intending to remain permanently childless, their responses to a question on
contraceptive behavior are examined.
Those who responded affirmatively to
the question “Are you using a method
to prevent pregnancy” are assumed to
be voluntarily childless (N = 152). In addition, noncontracepting women who
had (or whose husbands had) had a sterilizing operation and who also responded affirmatively to the question,
‘“‘Was the operation done at least partly
so that you would not have any (more)
children,” are labelled voluntarily childless. No women fell into this category in
1973. If there was no operation (N= 19)
or if the operation was not performed
for contraceptive purposes (N= 86),
then the noncontracepting childless
women are designated involuntary.

 
Vol. 30, No. 3

After applying this approach to data
from the 1973 survey, we conclude that,
in 1973, nearly 17 per cent of the childless women are voluntarily childless,
and almost 12 per cent are involuntarily
childless. As with the preceding approach, we find almost 72 per cent are
temporarily childless.

Both the cognitive and the behavioral
strategies have been applied in each of
five fertility surveys conducted between

= 1955 and 1975. We also subdivide the
‘women in each survey into two age
8 groups (under age 30, and 30 years of
® age and older) and apply the two proceA dures in each age group for each of the
<0 five surveys. We turn in the next section
to an examination and discussion of
co these results.

+= In this final section of the paper we
D first summarize and examine the results
= on childlessness according to the cogni
— tive and behavioral approaches of deter© mining voluntary and involuntary cate8 gories. The basic trends in childlessness
S between 1955 and 1973 are then exam8 ined, and an interpretation is proposed
A to assist in understanding the data.

This paper has developed two approaches for separating childless women
into voluntary and involuntary categories; the approaches have been applied
to five national surveys conducted in
1955, 1960, 1965, 1970, and 1973. The
approaches first eliminated nonwhite
and pregnant respondents from the
groups to be examined. Then the childless women were identified and the temporarily childless women extracted. At
this point the two approaches, the cogni
Voluntary and Involuntary Childlessness

259

tive and the behavioral, were separately
applied to distinguish the voluntarily
from the involuntarily childless. These
procedures involving both approaches
were employed three times in each of
the five fertility surveys: first, to childless women of all ages; second, to these
women under age 30; and third, to these
women age 30 and over.

The results are summarized in Table
2. This table presents the percentage
distributions of white nonpregnant
childless wives in each survey, by temporary, voluntary, and involuntary categories, according to both the cognitive
(upper panel) and the behavioral (lower
panel) approaches. For instance, according to the cognitive separation procedure, in 1955, about 47 per cent of
white, married, childless females were
temporarily childless; 12 per cent, voluntarily childless; and almost 41 per
cent, involuntarily childless. According
to the behavioral approach, half as
many were voluntarily childless, and six
per cent more were involuntarily childless. As noted above, the percentages of
women temporarily childless will always
be the same for both approaches. As
seen also in Table 2, following the cognitive approach, we find there were more
involuntarily than voluntarily childless
women in 1955 and in 1960, but the
trend reversed itself in 1965, 1970, and
1973 with more women in the voluntary
than the involuntary category.

Conversely, the behavioral approach
always yields higher percentages in the
involuntary than in the voluntary category for all age groups, except in 1973.
In this last period surveyed, the voluntarily childless were more numerous
among all women and among women
under age thirty.

A striking finding is that the behavioral and the cognitive approaches yield

very different and consistently different
results, except in 1973. The cognitive
approach always results in more childless women categorized as voluntary
than does the behavioral approach. For
instance, in 1965 the cognitive approach
identified over 31 per cent of the 435
childless women as voluntarily childless,
whereas the behavioral approach classified only about 9 per cent of them in
this way. In 1973 the two approaches ap=peared to converge, and only small dif“ferences were observed in their respective percentages classified as voluntarily
a nd involuntarily childless.
® Comparing the two approaches indiocates clearly that the voluntary and inovoluntary childlessness classifications
“are not at all identical. The scheme foc~dusing on knowledge of one’s fecundity
produces one set of results, while the
Sprocedure relying on the practice or
“gionpractice of contraceptive behavior
SJeads to another set of results. Addi‘ational study would appear necessary be“fore deciding that one approach is prefferable over another. Indeed, both
‘capproaches have their advantages deending upon whether the investigator
wishes to concentrate on knowledge or
‘behavior as the main criterion for the
‘voluntary and involuntary designations.
‘<= What do the results of this analysis
csuggest about trends in voluntary and in“voluntary childlessness in the United
States? In these final paragraphs we set
forth first a review of the general trends
in childlessness and then discuss these
trends. We restrict our data analysis to
the childlessness data separated into
voluntary and involuntary categories
following the cognitive approach. Although the data themselves are somewhat different, their general trends are
not that divergent. Thus, the observations and conclusions made according to

Voluntary and Involuntary Childlessness

301

the cognitive-based distinctions will not
be markedly dissimilar from those which
would be written following the behavioral separation procedures. Of course,
not all the differences over time are statistically significant, particularly those
involving comparisons of women 30
years of age and older in GAF-I, owing
to their quite small sample size.

What then have been the trends in
childlessness since 1955 in the United
States according to the results of our
study? Table 3 reorganizes some of the
data presented earlier in this report in a
form enabling us to address this question. In 1955 nearly 15 per cent of U.S.
women were childless. This figure fell to
11 per cent in 1960 and 10.5 per cent in
1965. The percentage childless then increased to 12.9 per cent in 1970, and to —
16.4 per cent in 1973. These general patterns follow roughly in an inverse manner the course of fertility in the U.S.
over about the same period; as the fertility rate increased, childlessness decreased, and vice versa.

When one focuses only on women
under age 30, however, the pattern is
one of increasing levels of childlessness
for each of the years sampled since 1955:
about 12 per cent in 1955, 15.1 per cent
in 1960, 16.8 per cent in 1965, 22 per
cent in 1970, and 30.6 per cent in 1973.
The trends for the older women at each
survey date are somewhat irregular and
thus difficult to discuss straightforwardly; this is particularly due to the
very high percentage of childless women
in 1955. These older women in 1955
comprise the birth cohorts of 1910-25,
and many of them are women who went
through their childbearing years during
the depression years as well as those of
World War I, eras characterized by very
low fertility and high childlessness. Presumably many of the women in this 30 +

age group sampled in the 1955 survey
were among these low fertility and high
childlessness cohorts and are not fully
representative of most of the others
studied in 1955. Relaxing the effects or
influence of the 1955 groups, the trends
in childlessness for the older women
partially resemble the decreasing and
then increasing pattern observed in the
total population.

The general pattern of childlessness
from 1955 to 1973 observed in the populations studied should mainly be reflecting changing patterns of voluntary childlessness. That is, the voluntary component of total childlessness should be
varying inversely with fertility. The involuntary component should be tending
more toward stability than variation
over the periods studied. Accordingly,
the pattern of decreasing childlessness
through the 1960’s, followed by increasing childlessness in the 1970’s, should be

particularly prominent among the voluntarily chitaless.

Examination of the percentages of
women voluntarily childless in Table 3,
however, does not indicate such a pattern in the total population. But among
younger women, the trend Is very apparent. Two per cent of the younger
women were voluntarily childless in
1955, and over one per cent in both 1960
and 1965; the percentage then increased
to 2.2 in 1970, and even higher to 3.7 in
1973. This trend follows in an opposite
manner the general course of fertility
over the same period. Although the
trends in involuntary childlessness do
vary somewhat over the period, they do
tend toward stability since 1965. Observe in particular the near-constant involuntary percentages for women of 30
or more years of age in 1965, 1970, and
1973.

To this point we have focused only on
 

Vol. 30, No. 3

voluntary and involuntary childlessness
and have paid no attention to women
designating themselves as temporarily
childless. In certain respects, our understanding of the levels of voluntary childlessness should be enhanced by knowledge of the temporarily childless. A
recent analysis by Masnick (1980) suggests that sizable portions of the tempo
Voluntary and Involuntary Childlessness

303

large percentage of temporarily childless women in 1955 (for the kinds of reasons suggested earlier), we may observe
rather large increases in temporary
childlessness from 1960 to 1973. Over 3
per cent of the women were temporarily
childless in 1960, nearly 9 per cent in
1970, and almost 12 per cent in 1973.
Among the women under age 30, the

rarily childless of past cohorts have re
, mained childless through the termina= tion of their childbearing years.
‘\ To examine more closely the tempo8 rarily childless and Masnick’s implica® tions about this group, we have reorganA ized our basic data tabulating them
co solely on the basis of temporary and pera manent childlessness. Table 4 combines
co the voluntarily and involuntarily child
= less into a single category (permanently
= ~ childless); the remaining women belong
Esto the temporary group. Excluding the

patterns are even more pronounced; the
percentages in both 1955 and 1960 were
slightly more than 3 per cent, but they
increased to about 15 per cent in 1965,
19 per cent in 1970, and over 25 per cent
in 1973. Understandably, the percentages of temporary childlessness for
women of age 30 and older are not as
high as the percentages for the younger
women, except for 1955, but as we have
noted earlier, these older women comprise a rather “‘special case” cohort.

If Masnick’s predictions are correct,

and large fractions of the temporarily
childless women remain childless
through the end of their childbearing

years, we can expect to observe even.

greater percentages of voluntary childlessness than those described in the preceding paragraphs. The emergence of
voluntary childlessness as a less than deviant lifestyle (if only in terms of numerical frequency) would appear thus to be
a very real possibility, based upon the
data of this report. Why should this be
so? Why should there be increases in
voluntary childlessness in the United
States? As we observed earlier, most of
the childlessness occurring among U.S.
women from 1940 to 1960 was due
mainly to involuntary sterility or subfecundity. However, since the 1960's, data
and studies, many of which were reviewed earlier in this report, suggest an
increase in overall rates of childlessness,
particularly its voluntary form. Why
have there been increases in voluntary
childlessness? What types of soctetal
level mechanisms may be related to the
emergence of this phenomenon?

It may well be that the emergence of
voluntary childlessness is linked with
broader changes in the fabric of the
U.S. society regarding fertility control,
contraceptive technology, sexual and
family norms, and female work patterns
and preferences. Bumpass (1973, p. 67)
has noted that

significant proportions of the population
[now] . . . expect fertility control to be
both complete and unobtrusive... .
[Therefore] childbearing can now be voluntary in a radically different sense than
ever before. Under the previous fertility
regime, women could not confidently
plan a lifetime of childlessness, nor even
the prevention of unwanted fertility. Qbviously, some women could and did avoid
unwanted fertility but no individual could
be sure of that outcome in advance. . . .

Poston and Kramer

Social Biology

The gestalt that accompanied this regime
was one in which the adult role expecta
_ tions of women were structured around
motherhood, and the separation of work
and home in industrial society buttressed
this role structure. Cultural values with
respect to fertility were, in part, rationalization of the inevitable.

Important for our understanding of
the increasing trends in childlessness is
the fact that the changing values of this
fertility control revolution have legitimized and have begun to make possible
the realization of equal opportunity between the sexes because nonfamilial
roles for women are now a realistic option.

The potential for complete fertility contro] makes childbearing—when and if—a
matter of choice in an ultimate sense that
never before existed. For the first time
motherhood itself is fully a matter for rational evaluation. Since it. . . [no longer
must] be rationalized because inevitable,
costs as well as virtues must be weighed.
... Obviously, childbearing roles offer
much that is rewarding, but these rewards
are not likely to be experienced equally
by all women. . . . [Motherhood has become a competitor} with other social
roles. (Bumpass, 1973, p. 68).

The above arguments have been set
forth in an attempt to provide an interpretation of recent changes in fertility
control, especially as they relate to the
question of childlessness. If the reasoning is true and the society is indeed experiencing a major change in fertility control values, these kinds of explanations
may aid in accounting for the increases
in voluntary childlessness occurring in
the United States in the late 1960’s and
early 1970’s among the cohorts of young
white women. They suggest that the increasing childlessness is voluntary, and
the increases have not been due to increasing sterility and subfecundity stemming from involuntary factors.
