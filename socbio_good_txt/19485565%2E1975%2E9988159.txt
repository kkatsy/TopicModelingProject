Intergenerational Fertility Throughout

Four Generations

The study of human fertility has long
been an area of critical interest to social
and biological scientists. Myriad social and
biological variables have been investigated
in order to determine the factors that influence the wide variation in fertility rates
in various populations at different points
in time. An independent variable that has
generated considerable interest among researchers has been the impact of the size
of one’s parents’ family (the family of
orientation) upon the size of one’s own
family (family of procreation).

Pearl (1939) evaluated a number of research attempts to biometrically determine
the impact of genetic inheritance upon
human fertility. He ranked various studies
on the strength of the correlations between
the size of the family of orientation and
the size of families of procreation. The
strength of the correlation coefficients
range from the Pearson et al. study (1899)
in which an r of 0.213 was obtained to a
—0.037 reported by Fetscher (1933). Pearson et al. reported data on the correlations
of the family size of both the father and
the mother while the other studies confined themselves to the family size of one
parent only. A recent replication of Pearson’s classic study by Williams and Wil
liams (1974) virtually substantiated the
correlations obtained by Pearson.

Berent (1953) points out that Pearson
et al. (1899) investigated intergenerational fertility from a hereditary standpoint, assuming that man inherits the
capacity to reproduce. The Pearson study
somewhat obscured the important distinction between fertility (the actual rate of
reproduction) and fecundity (the biological capacity to reproduce). This same obfuscated perspective was shared by Huestis
and Maxwell (1932) who looked at the
inherited desire to have children, all but
ignoring fluctuations in fecundity or the
biological capacity to reproduce. Their rationale was that with the increasing popularity and effectiveness of birth control
techniques, parents could then choose the
size family they desired.

Berent (1953), on the other hand, separated birth “controllers” from “non-controllers” and correlated the results of each
group with the size of their respective
families of orientation. In both cases, he
found the patterns of procreation to be
similar to the patterns of the family of
orientation. He concluded that both the
biological ability to have children as well
as “family building habits” are inherited.

As a revision of Berent’s conclusions,
we proposed that, given a random and
equally fecund population, fertility rates
would largely be the result of socialization
or training within the parental household.
Freedman (1961) contends that the question of family size is one that is faced in
all societies and is of sufficient importance
that societal and cultural norms governing
family building habits emerge to meet this
problem in most cases. These norms are
likely to prescribe a range of acceptable
or desirable numbers of children, and this
range is then amplified through the interpretation and transmission of such norms
from parents to children.

Rainwater (1960, p. 55) has proposed:

It is possible that some lower class couples

who end up with more children than they

want are unconsciously emulating their parents despite their more conscious desires to

have a family size more in keeping with
their financial resources for urban living.

Tf, as Freedman (1961) contends, family size is a function of social climate, it
would be well to discover the extent to
which norms regarding “family building
habits” do in fact consistently obtain.
Previous studies have been concerned with
two or three generations and have focused
upon only one parent. A significant contribution of this research report will be its
focus upon intergenerational fertility
spanning four generations over a period of
125 years.

This longitudinal approach to the problem of intergenerational fertility transmission should help to establish how consistently “inheritable” fertility is. It would
be tenuous to infer that the correlation between only two generations at any given
point in time indicates that there will be
a similar correlation at any other given
point in time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study were obtained
from the Genealogical Library of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (Mormons) in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Because of their belief in the eternal perpetuation of the family, the church encourages its members to search out, identify, and record their ancestry. The Genealogical Library is maintained to aid them
in their search with an extensive collection
of world-wide census data, parish records,
family histories, and other data that might
be of genealogical significance. These data
are contained in 800,000 rolls or 80 million
feet of microfilm and 100,000 books. In
addition, the library serves as a repository
for individual pedigrees of Mormons and
non-Mormons alike.

Once a person has ascertained the pertinent data on a family line, he or she submits what is known as a “family group
sheet.” The family group sheet contains
all available birth, marriage, and death
dates and their locations for both mother
and father and their offspring. The collection of the family group sheets over four
generations comprised the primary data
source for this project.

Four-hundred families in which the
wife was born between 1825 and 1850
were chosen at random from the family
group sheets. Lines of descent were followed wherever possible. It was assumed
that beginning with a family from this
period would make it possible to examine
four generations of completed families
with the wife in the last generation having
been born prior to 1925. Thus, she would
have been at least forty years old and
would have completed her fertility cycle
by the time the earliest of the family group
sheets used for this study were submitted
to the library in 1965. Data on the last, or
fourth generation, proved to be the hardest

to find. It was discovered that a few families had completed only three generations
prior to 1925. This partially accounts for
the slight incongruence in the total number
in the following statistical tables.

It proved to be a formidable task to
trace all of the children within each respective family of orientation across four
successive generations. Therefore, we decided to trace each family line through
the eldest and the youngest children who
had been married. This procedure maximized the within-group variance in each
family, thus eliciting rather conservative
correlations. We assumed that siblings who
were in contingent birth order would have
the most similar fertility patterns. Thus,
we intentionally selected the oldest and
youngest children in order to insure that,
if indeed strong positive correlations in
intergenerational fertility did occur, this
would mot be the result of selecting only
those children whose fertility, for various
reasons, may most closely approximate
that of their parents or siblings. In order
to control for the influence of multiple
marriages, persons married more than once
during their childbearing years were excluded from the study.

The size of the family of orientation for
both the husband and the wife was obtained whenever possible. The data were
coded from 1,070 family group sheets consisting of 402 families in the first generation (wife born between 1825 and 1850),
329 second-generation families, 248 thirdgeneration families, and 89 families from
the fourth generation. The third and
fourth generations were predominantly
Mormons, including recent converts, living
within the western United States. The two
earlier generations, however, consisted of
many non-Mormons since the Church was
not founded until 1830, and most of those
in the first generation had not yet been
converted. The ancestry of those included

in the sample was predominantly AngloSaxon, Northern European, and Scandinavian in origin. Each successive generation
was determined by the lines of lineal
descent from the initial families referred
to as the first generation.

It was hypothesized that a positive correlation would be found between family
sizes in successive generations and that the
magnitude of this correlation would decrease as the families approached the
present.

RESULTS
We first examined the mean number of

children born to couples married during
successive decades beginning with 1840.
These data reveal that family size remained fairly stable between 1860 and
1900 and then dropped rapidly, reaching
its lowest point for couples married during
the 1920’s. The mean number of children
declined from a high of 8.87 for couples
married between 1851 and 1860 to a low
of 3.61 for those married between 1921
and 1930 (Table 1). This finding is consistent with Kiser’s (1970) observation
that, with the exception of the 1860 census, there was a steady decline in fertility
within the United States from 1800 to

1936. As expected, the standard deviation
also decreased considerably from a high
of 7.66 between 1851 and 1860 to a low of
1.69 during the Depression.

When the families are grouped by generation, the decline in family size is quite
apparent, with average decreases of 0.94
children between the first and second generations, 2.46 between the second and
third generations, and 0.76 between the
third and fourth generations (Table 2).

Also apparent was the decrease in the
variance within generations. The standard
deviation for the first generation was 5.49;
it declined to 2.31 within the fourth generation (Table 2). This reduction in variance is, of course, at least in part a function of the diminution of family size itself.
Nevertheless, there is a definite trend in
the recent generation toward a more uniform family size.

The correlation coefficients between the
size of each parent’s family of orientation
and the size of their family of procreation
by marriage cohort revealed a great deal
of fluctuation with regard to which marital
partner exerts the stronger influence upon
fertility. Huestis and Maxwell (1932) and
Berent (1953) maintained that the
mother’s family accounted for more of the
variation in the family of procreation than
did the father’s family.

In a more recent analysis of intergenerational fertility in Japan, Imaizumi et al.
(1970) found stronger mother-offspring
correlations in four out of the five ten-year

Intergenerational Fertility 147

cohorts investigated. Correlations ranged
from 0.272 for mothers and their offspring
to a low of —0.002 for fathers and their
offspring.

However, an analysis of the partial correlations for cohorts within our data (Table 3) shows that in five out of nine cohorts there was a higher correlation
between the father’s family of orientation
and procreation. These findings substantiate the observation of Duncan et al.
(1965) that the wife’s family does not
exert a substantially stronger. relationship
to fertility than does the husband’s family
of orientation.

Correlation coefficients between the size
of the respective families of orientation
of the father and of the mother with the
size of their own respective family of procreation are also somewhat enigmatic
(Table 4). The correlation between the
family size of the first and second generations is 0.21 for the fathers and 0.23
for mothers. Family size during those early
years remained fairly stable, and the differences between the mean family size for
those two generations is slightly less than
one (Table 2).

When the correlations between the second
and third generations are examined, it is
apparent that the relative influence of the
size of the father’s family of orientation
has decreased (0.17) while the mother’s
influence has risen slightly (0.24). This
change is borne out by a comparison of
differences between the means for the two
generations. Although there was a sharp
drop in the number of the children born
in the third generation, the strength of the
positive correlation between the size of
families of orientation and procreation remained relatively strong. This finding
would indicate a sustained tendency for
those from large families to still bear large
families of procreation even though these
families were not as large as those of their

respective parents. The same general trend

would also hold true for those from small
families who themselves bore small
families.

Between the third and fourth generations, the mean number of children declined only 0.76 (Table 2), but the correlation coefficients indicate an inverse
relationship between the size of the family
of orientation and the family of procreation (—0.03 for fathers and —0.15 for
mothers). A partial correlation between the
mother’s family of orientation and her

own family of procreation, controlling for
father’s family size, is even larger
(—0.217), indicating a definite shift toward the tendency for those from large
families to bear small families and vice
versa.

DISCUSSION

It is apparent from the results of this
study, and those cited previously, that
the size of the family of orientation has
a relatively small influence upon the size
of the family of procreation. Since the

Vol. 22, No. 2

average family size of most women included in studies of intergenerational
fertility never even approach maximum
fecundity, we agree with Neel and Schull
(1972, p. 369) that “the existing data
deal with ‘social fertility’ rather than
‘natural fertility.’” In other words, the
case seems to be stronger for the intergenerational transmission of “family
building habits” discussed earlier than
for the heritability of fecundity.

This conclusion contradicts Fisher’s
(1930, p. 217) often-cited statistical inference that “41.8 per cent of the observed variance in fertility is ascribable
to heritable causes.” The magnitude of the
intergenerational correlations obtained in
these data approximate those obtained by
Williams and Williams (1974), Imaizumi
et al. (1970), Duncan et al. (1965), and
Pearson et al. (1899). Although a number of statistically significant correlations were obtained between parental
family size and the family size of their
offspring, the amount of explained variance (R?) in fertility rates is generally
closer to 5 per cent than to the 41.8 per
cent claimed by Fisher.

SUMMARY
A random sample of 1,070 genealogical
“family group sheets” was analyzed across
four generations to determine the relationship between the fertility in one’s parental family of orientation and one’s own

Intergenerational Fertility | 149

family of procreation. Congruent with
previous studies of population cohorts,
steady declines in average family size
were observed through all but three tenyear cohorts and throughout all four
generations.

In five of the nine ten-year marriage
cohorts, the correlations were higher between the father’s family of procreation
and his own family of orientation than
were the correlations for the mother.
However, in terms of intergenerational
fertility, correlations were higher for
women than for men with regard to the
influence of the parent’s family upon the
family size of their progeny.

The highest intergenerational correlation obtained was 0.242, indicating a
rather small proportion of the explained
variance in fertility rates is attributable .
to the size of one’s own family of orientation.
