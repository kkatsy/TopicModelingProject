© ABSTRACT: This paper examines the fertility attitudes of a sample of 202 male Nigerian stu€ dents studying in the United States. Specifically, three dimensions were investigated: (1) per9 ceptions of population problems in Nigeria; (2) attitudes toward family planning, divorce, and
A male children; and (3) attitudes toward family size.
coo ©§6=>.- Findings indicate that: (1) In general, this sample does not believe there is a population prob— Jem in Nigeria, and rapid population growth is not a cause of poverty, poor health, or unem= ployment; (2) the majority of respondents agree that a government population policy should be
—adopted, but does not agree with government interference in the number of children a couple
desires; (3) family planning information and services should be made available to men, but
‘gs women should not practice family planning without the consent of their husbands; (4) duration
_ooof stay in the United States is inversely correlated with the number of children considered too
S many; and, (5) the number of male children is an extremely important variable in regard to
S additional children desired,
a Very little research has been conducted exclusively on male fertility attitudes in Nigeria,
>whereas those on women are numerous. Policies based on female fertility research do not ap“= pear to be solving the problem of rapid population growth in Nigeria and other African nations.
© The thrust of this paper, therefore, is to redress the unbalanced orientation in the study of fertil‘ity by securing information from men. Implications of the findings, recommendations, and fu~ ture research issues are discussed.

tries has been recognized by many
Western observers (for example, see
Harari, 1970). Evans (1962) asserted
that in Tropical Africa, Western education has been the catalyst of modern aspirations of the new African countries.
Evans, however, maintained that Western education inculcates new values,
which may promote social and political
development among African nations.
Similarly, Veroff (1963, p. 48) made the
following statements about African students in the United States:

Prognosticators of future events should
not minimize the potential impact of our
African students currently studying in
this country. Among this group will be
the political leaders, the technicians and
the teachers. ... what these students
take away with them about human
knowledge, and perhaps even more important, about our country, can have major implications in the political alignments of the future.

Given the role expectations of
American-trained Nigerians, the expenditure in training them abroad, and
the high number of returnees, the inability of the Nigerian government to control one of the major crises facing the
country, i.e., rapid population growth,
represents a paradox. Many Western
demographers are faced with the question of what kind of fertility attitudes are
developed and transplanted after Nigerian students complete their studies in
the United States.

This study attempts to push beyond
the conventional approach to the study
of fertility attitudes. It focuses on the
fertility attitudes of male Nigerian students in the United States in an attempt
to examine the perception of these students concerning population problems
in their country, and more importantly,
the type of fertility attitudes they de

velop while studying in the United
States. Specifically, this analysis addresses three dimensions: (1) perceptions of population problems in Nigeria;
(2) attitudes toward family planning, divorce, and male children; and (3) attitudes toward family size. Veroff (1963,
p. 48) emphasized:
One of the ways we look at the effect of
American schooling on African students
is to assess any changes in their attitudes
occurring in the course of their sojourn.
Some understanding may be gained,
thus, as to what kind of leaders with what
kind of images are returning to Africa.

These students are of special interest
for several reasons: (1) university students are identified as a key group that
takes active stands on policy issues in Nigeria; (2) university students are for the
most part the future policy makers of Nigeria, at least, by virtue of their education; (3) the men in this sample have
been exposed to the outside world, especially to the United States where communication.has increased their awareness of rapid population growth in
Africa and the world, (4) Nigeria is
mostly a male-dominated society, and
(5) because of their exposure to western
influence they are expected to manifest
some of the characteristics of modernism, such as attempting to control births
(Inkeles, 1966).

Nigeria is one of the fastest growing
countries in the world and the most populous in Africa. The present population
growth rate is 3.1-3.4 per cent per year.
Over 48 per cent of the population is under 15 years of age, and 3 per cent are
over 65 years, making the dependency
ratio very high. Nigeria’s age structure
depicts a most unfavorable picture for
economic growth because of the overwhelming preponderance of children of
dependent, non-productive age. ChilVol. 34, No. 1-2

dren as acategory are making the transition from producers to consumers. This
puts a heavy drain on the Nigerian economy, particularly when the transition
development process calls for education
and keeps the young dependent.
One of the major limitations facing
Nigerian-based fertility research is the
neglect of the role of men in probing the
circumstances that govern the number
not children, as well as the reproductive
= behavior of a couple. Research in this

“ area has been dominated by facts deB rived exclusively from women and most
9 policies based on these facts have not

a.

Like most African nations, Nigeria is
a partrilineal society. The male is very
important in decision-making concerning the reproductive behavior of
women. In a patrilineal family system,
the children born to a wife belong to her
husband. This is manifested in divorce
cases in Nigeria, where women have to
leave their children with their husbands.
The fertility attitudes of women are
mostly dictated by masculine values. As
Arowolo (1976, p. 12) confirmed:

Downloaded

In Nigeria, if the man desires a certain
family size, there is little the women can

Male Fertility Attitudes 59

do to prevent having that number of children. Should she fail to produce children
of a particular sex, or be unable to
achieve the desired family size due to fecundity impairment, infant mortality, or
both, the man can and does take another
woman.

Pronatalist pressures are reinforced
by the domination of males over females
which preclude women from controlling
their own fertility. The rapid increase in
population growth in Nigeria is in fact
accentuated by the very pronatalist attitudes of men. For example: (1) most Nigerian men place a high premium on
many children and are strongly motivated to demand this of their wives; (2)
men attribute social status to women on
the basis of number of children; (3) men
become polygnists because of the barrenness of their wives; (4) men tend to
marry younger women who will guarantee them many years of childbearing; (5)
they prefer to marry women who have
already given evidence of fertility by
their pregnancy (Brown, 1981; Bhatia,
1978; Huston, 1977; Clignet and Sween,
1974; Caldwell, 1967). Despite these
pronatalist attributes manifested by Nigerian men and documented by empirical research, policy-based research to
reduce high fertility in Nigeria has failed
to examine the complementarity of the
male perspective (Heisel, 1973; Okediji, 1967).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data presented here come from a
fertility attitude survey of male Nigerian
students in the United States conducted
in 1984. The study population consisted
of all Nigerian students enrolled in the
six Kansas regent’s institutions. These
institutions were chosen because they

60 Adamchak and Adebayo

offer a good mix of Nigerian population
in terms of age, education, marital status, religious affiliation, and duration of
stay. The 220 male students represent a
composite of undergraduate and graduate students.

The survey instrument was a mailback questionnaire of items related to
fertility attitudes, as well as social, economic, and demographic characteristics. Dillman’s (1978) sampling procedure was employed. Questionnaires
were sent to all 220 students, and 202
questionnaires were returned, for a 92
per cent response rate.

SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE

This sample is somewhat unique in
that these men are highly educated compared to Nigeria men in general and
they have been exposed to Western values. The purpose of selecting this sample was twofold: (1) Most of these men
will be in various decision-making positions in their careers; and, (2) as a result
of their education and positions they will
be the future “‘trend-setters” in Nigerian
society. For example, if the educated
professional-technical class in Nigeria
have certain attitudes and behavior, one
can assume that these attitudes and behavior, will eventually diffuse throughout the society as development progresses. If these men have large
families, we should expect all Nigerian
men to have/desire large families. However, if this sample (as an indicator) develops a modern attitude toward fertility
and family size, the expectation is that
this attitude will eventually spread beyond the educated professionaltechnical class.

These assumptions are also based on
characteristics of Nigerian men studying
in the United States. Of those who are

 

Social Biology

married, approximately 90 per cent are
married to Nigerian women. In terms of
assimilation, 80 to 85 per cent return to
Nigeria after they complete their studies. In this sample, 86 per cent expect to
return to Nigeria, and 11 per cent were
uncertain. Only 3 per cent said they plan
not to return to Nigeria.

A sizeable proportion of Nigerian
students are supported by Nigerian government or university scholarships. In
this sample 31 per cent were supported
in this way. This makes the sample population older than university students in
Nigeria and American university students. The mean age of this sample was
30.7 years (28.7 years for undergraduates, and 33.5 years for graduate students). Those respondents supported by
Nigerian government or university
scholarships were already working for
the government or a university. Moreover, 58 per cent of the sample was composed of undergraduate students and 42
per cent, graduate students, which also
makes the age distribution of this sample older, since graduate students are
generally older (see Table 1 for social
and demographic characteristics of the
sample).

Upon their return to Nigeria, the majority willseek employment in federal or
state government. The university system and the private sector cannot absorb all degree holders. Therefore, the
government is the largest employer of
those with degrees.

respondents indicate that there are “too

majority of students do not consider
overpopulation as an impending crisis in
Nigeria. These responses may explain
the lassitude, until recently of Nigeria’s
government toward population control.
Several factors may influence the perception of those students concerning Ni

geria’s population growth; for example,
(1) the respondent’s may view a rapidly
growing population as a pathway to economic development, especially if the oil
economy is turned around, and (2) since
the respondents represent a good mix of
the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria, the struggle for ethnic domination
may influence their perception.

When a question was asked as to
whether “abject poverty, poor health,
and high unemployment in Nigeria are
partly rooted in excess population
growth,” the majority of respondents
(68 per cent) did not see overpopulation
as a contributing factor whereas 29 per
cent responded “yes,” and 4 per cent indicated ‘‘don’t know.”

The opinions of the students concerning the adoption of a population control
policy by the Nigerian government was
examined. Fifty-three per cent agreed
that the government should adopt a
population policy. However, government interference in the number of children a couple desires was clearly not endorsed. Sixty-seven per cent of the
respondents agreed or strongly agreed
that the government should not interfere with family size. It seems that the
majority of respondents are aware of the
future danger of rapid population
growth (by a positive response to a government population policy), but consider government interference with family size as an invasion of privacy or an
infringment on their individual freedom.

ATTITUDES TOWARD FAMILY PLANNING,
Divorce, AND MALE CHILDREN

Table 3 reveals that an overwhelming
majority of the sample (84 per cent) endorses the idea that family planning information and services should be made

Social Biology

available to men. This does not imply
that family planning information will
result in low fertility. Family planning
information may be perceived as useful
in pacing or understanding how births
are prevented and not necessarily in reducing the number of children.

This notion may find support since 69
per cent agree with the item that women
should not practice family planning
without the consent of their husbands.
The general attitude of the respondents
toward abortion varied considerably.
More than half of the sample (55 per
cent) oppose abortion, whereas 29 per
cent approve and 16 per cent were uncertain.

Table 3 indicates that the sample of
men favor having family planning information, but want to control family plan

ning practice and utilization among
women.

Table 4 presents data on attitudes toward divorce and male children. Fortythree per cent of the respondents
claimed that divorce should result from
“‘barrenness of wife,” “inability of the
wife to bear a male child,” and “‘the inability to bear the number of children
demanded by her husband.” Although
,, the majority didn’t respond in this way,
= the large number who did indicate that
& the male Nigerian students in this sample place a high value on children.

The fact that 36 per cent of the respondents indicated that a man should
divorce his wife if she were barren is not
a strange phenomenon in the context of
co Nigerian culture. One major explana
= tion is the widely-held notion within the

‘g society that the woman is more likely to
& account for a couple’s childlessness than
the male. Secondly, the fact that polyg> yny is a common practice among Nigerian men may explain why a preponderance of this population did not consider
any of the conditions as grounds for divorce, since a man can marry a second
third wife.

Nearly 35 per cent of the respondents
© indicated that a man should marry a sec& ond wife or continue to have children if a
= couple had five daughters and no sons.

A Iwenty-six per cent indicated that aman

A should adopt a baby boy or be content in

this situation. Little can be generalized

from this item since 39 per cent responded “don’t know.”’ However, with

35 per cent marrying a second wife or

continuing to have children, and 39 per

cent uncertain what to do in this situation sugpests the importance of having
male children regardless of parity.

The final item in Table 4 represents

about the value of children. Sixty-two

ATTITUDES TOWARD FAMILY SIZE

Table 5 displays zero-order correlation coefficients among selected family
size variables for the married respondents with children. There is a significant inverse correlation (r = —0.18,
p < 0.05) between additional number of
children and number of male children.
This finding seems to give empirical endorsement to the fact that married respondents with more male children tend
to want fewer additional children. A
positive relationship between additional
number of children and the number of
female children is evident (r = —0.19,
p <0.05), indicating that married men
with relatively more female children
want to increase their number of children. However, when the number of
male children was controlled, the observed correlation between parity and
additional number of children increased

 

Social Biology

from r = 0.00 to r = 0.23 (p< 0.05).
This demonstrates that the number of
male children a man has is an important
determinant of future family size.

Respondents’ duration of stay in the
United States and the number of children considered “‘too many” depicts a
significant negative correlation (r = ~
0.24, p < 0.001). This relationship tends
to be more pronounced after a respondent has been in the United States for
more than four years. Controlling for
age, we find that the partial correlation
coefficient between duration of stay and
number of children considered “‘too
many’ increases to r= —0.33
(p < 0.001). Regardless of age, the
longer a student stays in the United
States, the number of children consid‘ered too many declines.

As one would expect, the correlation
between number of wives and parity was
significantly correlated (r= 0.64,

more children than respondents with

In summary, the results of the correlation analysis reveals the following: (1)

ISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

© The purpose of this research was to
‘examine the fertility attitudes of male
Wigerian students in the United States,
‘sand to address the gender gap in Nige“rian fertility research. This research dif-fers somewhat from other research en“@leavors that have included men in
Nigeria (Caldwell, 1982; Owie, 1980) in
She sense that men in this sample maniest the following characteristics: (1)
Their infants and children have a lower
mortality rate, making fewer births necessary for any desired number of children; (2) they may consider children
more of a liability rather than an asset
because of their non-agrarian lifestyle,
Western socialization, and being taken
out of the typical Nigerian family context; and (3) they have better access to
information about means of fertility
control.

should divorce his wife if the wife is barren, unable to bear a male child, or unable to bear the number of children demanded by her husband; (5) 35 per cent
indicated that a man should “‘marry a
second wife,” or “‘continue to have children” if a couple has five daughters and
no sons; (6) 62 per cent indicated that
“children are wealth” or “better than
wealth”; (7) duration of stay in the
United States was inversely correlated
with the number of children considered
too many; and (8) the number of male
children ts an extremely important variable in regard to additional children desired.

The preference for male over female
children is not unique to this sample of
men. Harari (1970) found that desire for
sons is stronger in males than in females
in Africa. Also, Williamson (1976)
found the preference for male children
is common in Latin American countries.
However, the males in this sample will
be among the most educated in Nigeria,
and they still seem to hold some fairly
traditional values in regard to fertility
and family formation.

The average number of children desired by married male respondents was
higher than that desired by their wives

(5.4 and 4.4, respectively). The reason
for such a sex differential may be that
women are more likely to be content
with the sex of their children. The blame
of not having a male child or childlessness is always on the women. Bhatia’s
(1978) study of ideal number of children
and sex preference in India revealed
that husbands, on the average, desire
more children than wives (9.3 and 6.4,
respectively). Spillane and Ryser (1975)
observed a slight difference in desired
number of children between husbands
and wives in the U.S.

It appears that level of education
does not have a great impact on fertility
attitudes in this sample, particularly the
desire for male children. In addition,
age at marriage does not affect the fertility attitudes of the married respondents.
Men prefer to marry younger women
who will guarantee many years of childbearing. The age difference between
husbands and wife is consistent with
Ware’s (1979) view that most African
men will not forego their studies for
marriage. In Ghana, Caldwell (1967)
observed that age at marriage increases
with education. Caldwell’s study also reveals that husbands were 5 to 6 years
older than their wives in urban areas and
approximately 12 years older in rural areas. Bhatia’s analysis of reproductive
norms and behavior in rural Ghana indicates that men were on the average 9
years older than their wives. While most
studies found that lower fertility of educated women in Nigeria disappears
when age at marriage was held constant
(Olusanya, 1967; Ohadike, 1967), age at
marriage does not affect the fertility of
men in this sample. Married men were
8.5 years older than their wives (34.6
and 26.1 years, respectively).

The theoretical assumption that

higher education results in lower fertility, at best, may hold for both men and
women in developed nations where
there is a slight, or no age differential
between husband and wife. Furthermore, nearly 70 per cent of the respondents agree that a woman should not
practice birth control without the consent of her husband. In Kenya, Huston
(1977) observed that women need their
husband’s permission to attend family
planning clinics. With this caveat in
mind, the theory and practice of family
planning evidently ignores male dominance when women are pressured to
practice family planning.

Based on the population dimensions
investigated in this research, namely,
perceptions of population problems in
Nigeria, attitudes toward family planning, divorce, and male children, and attitudes toward family size, it is apparent
that Nigerian men, including educated
men, have an important role in fertility
behavior and population growth since
they dominate and control many of the
structural, behavioral, and cultural dimensions of the process. We recommend that male attitudes and behavior
should be included in a complete fertility model in Nigeria and perhaps other
nations. A greater involvement of men
in future research would provide a realistic and holistic understanding of the
roles of men in the reproductive behavior of women in Africa.

In addition, several theoretical and
empirical relationships emanate from
this study: (1) education and fertility;
(2) old age security and fertility; and (3)
polygyny and fertility. The applicability
of these theoretical and empirical assumptions to men need to be reexamined in the context of Nigeria as well as
other African nations.
