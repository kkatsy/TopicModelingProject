ABSTRACT: This paper illuminates the demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with
smoking statuses. It employs the 1990 National Health Interview Survey’s Health Promotion and
Disease Prevention Supplement and logistic regression to examine the covariates of smoking
status among the U.S. adult population. Polychotomous logistic regression, which provides an
alternate way to examine smoking practices, simultaneously considers multiple variables and
their interactions, controls for other important covariates, produces predicted values and patterns, and allows multiple comparisons. By examining interactions, we have found that age
displays distinct, often curvilinear, patterns with smoking; that compared to females, males have
higher rates of cigarette consumption except at the youngest ages; that Anglos, especially Anglo
males, exhibit high probabilities of cigarette consumption but also high probabilities of being
former smokers; that Black males exhibit high probabilities of light smoking, but only at the older
ages, and that they also exhibit high probabilities of being former light smokers; and that
Mexican-American females are the least likely to currently smoke or to have ever smoked. By
clearly elucidating the demographic and socioeconomic variations in smoking, arguably the most
salient marker of health behavior, we can better target programs and policies geared toward the

reduction of smoking-related diseases and deaths.

There is a vast literature on the factors that influence smoking. Much of
this literature, however, examines only
one or two smoking statuses, and much
of it is aimed at how to bring about
smoking cessation (cf. Giovinno et al.,
1992). Our research focuses on multiple smoking statuses and aims to determine the underlying demographic
and socioeconomic factors related to
smoking status.

Our research on tobacco smoking
takes into account several broad categories of demographic and _ socioeconomic factors. The central demographic characteristics—age, sex, race/
ethnicity—are those that are ascribed
to the individual and are generally not
subject to change. The prevalence of
smoking is low at the youngest ages,

peaks at ages 25-44, and then declines
at older ages (CDC, 1993a). Compared
to women, men are more likely to
smoke and to smoke more cigarettes
per day, but they are also more likely
to quit. Furthermore, smoking prevalence has declined since 1965 for men
and since the late 1970’s for women
(CDC, 19935).

Compared to whites, blacks exhibit
higher rates of smoking, but initiate
smoking at later ages and smoke fewer
cigarettes per day (CDC, 1991). Although blacks try as often as whites,
they are less successful at quitting. Low
black cessation rates may be attributed
to a high nicotine dependence, induced
by menthol cigarettes, and revealed
through high black “wake-up” smok

minutes of awakening (see Novotny et
al., 1988; Orleans et al., 1989; Royce et
al., 1993). Compared to other groups,
Mexican-Americans are much more
likely to have never smoked; if they do
smoke, they smoke small quantities of
cigarettes (Rogers, 1991).
Socioeconomic status refers to those
factors that describe an individual’s relative social position in society. In past
research, the variables under this rubric have included aspects of education, occupation, income, and wealth.
In the context of this research, socioeconomic status reflects the package of
social and economic resources that
give persons the ability to acquire and
maintain good health. Compared to
the upper and middle classes, the lower
classes take longer to adapt to new
health practices, if they adapt at all.
In England, men in the highest social
class have largely stopped smoking,
but men in the lowest social class have
yet to change their smoking behavior significantly (Fox and Goldblatt,
1986). In the United States, those with
less education and lower incomes are
more likely to smoke and less likely to
quit (Novotny et al., 1988; Orleans et
al., 1989; CDC, 1993a). Indeed, while
Cigarette advertising seems to be en
couraging more lower-class women .

and minorities to smoke, more upperclass men are beginning to quit, or to
smoke less (Susser et al., 1985; Covey
et al., 1992).

Smoking habits represent the critical broad category of our analysis and
encompass a number of dimensions of
tobacco smoking behavior. These behaviors include whether persons have
ever smoked, whether they stopped
smoking if they once smoked, and,

‘the amount of smoking for those who

smoked. Moreover, whereas most pre
 

Social Biology

vious research has presented ‘‘average” smoking characteristics, we illustrate interactions by age, sex, and race,
and mediated by socioeconomic characteristics. Thus, in this article, the
central question we address is: How
are demographic and socioeconomic
factors related to smoking habits?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We employ the 1990 National
Health Interview Survey, Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Supplement (HPDP), to examine the sociodemographic covariates of cigarette
smoking. NHIS data are derived from
a household multistage sampling of the
civilian noninstitutional population of
the United States through both cluster
and stratified sampling techniques.
The NHIS—HPDP is based on 41,104
respondents aged 18 and over (NCHS,
1993). In addition to smoking, the
NHIS supplements asked respondents
about other characteristics, including
demographic factors and socioeconomic status.

Smoking categories follow the convention used by the Federal government: current smokers have smoked
at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime
and smoke at present; former smokers
have smoked at least 100 cigarettes
in the past but do not presently
smoke; never smokers either have
never smoked at all or have smoked
fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. We have grouped current and
former smokers into light (fewer than
20 cigarettes per day) and moderateto-heavy smokers (20 or more).}

1Some studies have disaggregated current smokers into more categories, examining, say, light,
moderate, and heavy smokers. Because of interactions with variables with low frequencies, particu

To measure ethnicity, we identified three subpopulations: MexicanAmericans, Anglos, and Blacks. Respondents who identified themselves
as Mexican, Mexicano, MexicanAmerican, and Chicano were recorded
as Mexican-American. Cubans, Puerto
Ricans, and the group “Other Hispanics” were excluded from the data set
because they were too small to analyze
separately and too diverse to combine
with Mexican-Americans. Anglos and
Blacks were selected from among
those who did not identify themselves
as Mexican-American.

We have included two measures of
socioeconomic status: income and education. Education was reported as
completed years of schooling. A detailed question on family income was
asked, but 11 per cent of the respondents did not answer it. We instead
use a broader question, which attained
a 98 per cent response rate, as to
whether the person’s family income is
$20,000 or higher. Thus, our analysis
is based on 37,282 Anglos, Blacks,
and Mexican-Americans who provided
income, education, and smoking
information.

To capture the smoking relationships within a multivariate framework,
we perform polychotomous logistic regression analyses with the statistical
package BMDP (Dixon et al., 1988).?

larly with those involving ethnicity, we have retained the light and moderate-to-heavy smoking
categories. Few Mexican-American females smoke,
especially at the higher levels of cigarette consumption.

2BMDP correctly calculates the coefficients for
polychotomous logistic regression, but does not
take into account NHIS-HPDP’s complex sampling
design in calculating the standard errors. On the
other hand, SUDAAN correctly calculates the standard errors from complex sample surveys for dichotomous but not polychotomous logistic regression
(see Shah et al., 1991). Therefore, to correctly
estimate the coefficients and the standard errors,

Polychotomous logistic regression,
which provides an alternate way to
examine smoking practices, simultaneously considers multiple variables
and their interactions, controls for
other important covariates, produces
predicted values and patterns, and allows multiple comparisons. In logistic
regression, when the predictor variable
X; changes by one unit, the corresponding B; coefficient indicates how
much the log of the odds changes relative to a baseline category (Knoke
and Bohrnstedt, 1994).

In contrasting groups, we examine
the odds ratios. Odds ratios offer the
advantages of clear interpretation and
values that do not vary even with shifts
in sample size or changes in the marginal distributions (see Morgan and
Teachman, 1988). To present the figures, we examine the probabilities,
which are calculated by:

Prob(event) = 1/(1 + e~%),
where

L= Bo + BX, + BLX>
+ B4X,4+...+ BX,

This procedure allows us to compare,
say, the probabilities of never smoking
and smoking low amounts of cigarettes, given certain characteristics,
say, for young Mexican-American females. In this way, we can demonstrate
how smoking patterns vary by demographic and socioeconomic factors.
Note that the figures we present represent predicted probabilities.

we used BMDP to calculate the coefficients, and
SUDAAN for the standard errors. Because the
standard errors are calculated relative to specific coefficients (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989), we have
presented the p-values but do not include standard

Interactions may take different
forms, so we define what we mean by
the presence and absence of interactions. If the association between one
independent variable, say sex, and the
dependent variable, smoking, is the
same within each level of another independent variable, say age, then
there is no interaction between age,
sex, and smoking. If, however, the relationship between sex and smoking
varies by different ages, then an interaction is present (see Hosmer and
Lemeshow, 1989).

RESULTS
COVARIATES OF SMOKING

Table 1 shows the distribution of
smoking habits by different factors.
Each of the rows adds to 100 per cent.
Thus, the first row shows that in
1990 almost half of all adults have
never smoked, one-quarter continue to
smoke, and a similar proportion have
quit. These results show curvilinear relations by age. For instance, there are
high proportions of very young or old
never smokers, but smaller proportions of never smokers in the middle
years. Among those young individuals
who do smoke, most smoke few cigarettes. Few individuals younger than
25 years of age are former smokers
because there has been a limited time
for younger smokers to initiate and
then quit smoking. Compared to those
younger than 25, those 25—44 years of
age are less likely to have abstained
from smoking, are more likely to currently smoke, and are substantially
more likely to have quit. Those 65 and
over are the most likely of all age
groups to have quit.

Social Biology

Compared to males, females are
more likely to have never started
smoking, are more likely to smoke
small quantities of cigarettes currently
but less likely to smoke large quantities, and are as likely to have quit
smoking small numbers of cigarettes
but more likely to have quit smoking
large numbers of cigarettes. Blacks and
Mexican-Americans are more likely
than Anglos to smoke a pack or less of
cigarettes a day, but Anglos are more
likely than other ethnic groups to
smoke larger quantities of cigarettes.

Generally, higher levels of education are associated with an increase in
the propensity of individuals to have
never smoked and, if asmoker, to have
quit (see CDC, 1993a; Pierce et al.,
1989). For example, 43 per cent of
those with 11 or fewer years of education have never smoked, compared to
59 per cent of those with 17 or more
years of schooling. Smoking differences by income are slight, but suggest
that individuals with higher incomes
are more likely to have never smoked
and, if they ever smoked, to have quit
(see also CDC, 1993a).

Table 2 shows the number of cigarettes consumed for current and
former smokers. Overall, current and
former smokers average a pack of cigarettes a day, with former smokers
having smoked slightly more. Generally, those 45-64 years of age, males,
Anglos, and less-educated individuals
smoke or smoked more cigarettes than
their counterparts. For instance, there
is a large sex gap for current and
former smokers, but especially for
former smokers. Males who formerly
smoked average almost seven cigarettes more than similar females. The
relationships in this table and Table 1,

An additional year of education increases the odds of never smoking
rather than current moderate smoking
by one-quarter. Similar results occur
for income: compared to never smokers, individuals with low income are
over 30 per cent more likely to smoke
currently than individuals with high
income. Generally, healthy practices
progress from the higher to the lower
socioeconomic statuses (see Novotny
et al., 1988; Orleans et al., 1989).

values) hold constant ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics. In the
second figure, we examine MexicanAmericans, Blacks, and Anglos by age
and smoking status, but hold constant
sex and socioeconomic factors.4

Age and Sex.—To understand how
smoking varies by age and sex, Figure
1 presents the probabilities calculated
from Table 3.5 We present eight of
the ten combinations.® The first four
panels contrast different ever smokers
to never smokers. Figure 1E compares
two groups of current smokers who
consume different amounts of tobacco.
Figure 1G provides a similar contrast,
but for former smokers. And Figures
1F and 1H each contrast subgroups
that currently smoke to others that
have quit. Therefore, unlike smoking
prevalence rates or quit rates, which
compare, say, former smokers to ever
smokers, these figures provide more
detail, comparing the probabilities that
individuals will be in one category or
another, say, former light or current
light smokers. As Figure 1 demonstrates, such contrasts reveal patterns
unexposed by prevalence or quit rates.

Smoking varies by age, with a distinct curvilinear pattern for ever smokers. In Figures 1A, 1B, and 1E, the

4The sample means were 0.47 for sex, 0.05 for
Mexican-Americans, 0.11 for Blacks, 12.97 for education, 0.67 for incomes of $20,000 or more, 6.17
for age, 48.17 for age, 2.86 for age by sex, 21.85 for
age? by sex, 0.22 for age by Mexican-American,
0.64 for age by Black, 1.37 for age? by MexicanAmerican, and 4.73 for age? by Black. Age is coded
in 5-year age intervals from age 1 (less than 20 years
of age) to 11 (age 65 and above).

sExcept for the age extremes, age is presented in
the figures as the initial age of the 5-year interval.

6We do not present current light to former
moderate-to-heavy smokers or current moderateto-heavy to former light smokers because these two
combinations do not compare subpopulations that
are in similar categories.

Social Biology

probabilities of ever smoking begin
low in young years, peak in the middle
years, and taper to low levels at older
years. For example, in Figure 1A, the
probability that males are current light
smokers rather than never smokers is
low at the youngest ages, peaks at
ages 40-44, and declines from ages 45
on. Former smokers, especially former
light smokers, display a more linear
pattern. Figures 1C and 1F indicate
that older individuals are more likely
than younger individuals to have quit,
and that the probability of being a
former light smoker instead of a never
smoker or current light smoker is highest for the oldest ages.

Several sex differences emerge from
these figures. First, males generally
exhibit higher probabilities than females of smoking and of smoking
larger quantities (see Figures 1A, 1B,
and 1E). But these higher probabilities
are partially offset by the greater probabilities males show for having quit
smoking, especially at higher levels of
cigarette consumption (see Figures 1C,
1D, and 1G).

Third, the peaks for smoking statuses vary by sex, with females peaking
at earlier ages than males (see Ernster
1993). For example, the peak for current moderate smokers ts at ages 45-49
for males, but five years earlier for females. A fourth and interrelated finding is that, between the sexes, there
are several age crossovers. Figure 1A
shows that, relative to never smokers,
young females are more likely than
young males to smoke less than a pack
of cigarettes a day. These figures, then,
help reveal the interrelations among
age, sex, and smoking statuses.

Age and Ethnicity.—Figure 2 presents age and ethnicity interactions by

smoking status. Again, observe the
general curvilinear relations with age.
In most figures, Mexican-Americans
and Blacks display similar patterns,
but with a few unique deviations by
Mexican-Americans. For example,
while Anglos and Blacks display
curvilinear relations between current
moderate-to-heavy and light smoking,
Mexican-Americans exhibit a linear
gradation. The probability of being a
current moderate-to-heavy relative
to current light smoker peaks at age
45 and then declines for Anglos and
Blacks, but continues to increase
through the oldest ages for MexicanAmericans. And whereas the probability of being a former smoker, rather than current moderate-to-heavy
smoker, is low at the youngest ages
and increases slowly until the oldest
ages, the probabilities for MexicanAmericans are more _ progressive.
Compared to never smokers, Blacks
who smoke are more likely than other
groups to smoke less than a pack of
cigarettes a day (see Rogers and
Crank, 1988). Anglos continue to exhibit the highest levels of moderate-toheavy smoking, but also exhibit the
greatest chances of quitting at
moderate-to-heavy levels (see Figures
2B, 2D, 2E, and 2G).

Sex and Ethnicity. —Figure 3 reveals
interactions between sex, ethnicity,
and smoking. Males are generally
more likely than females to have ever
smoked, especially at higher levels of
consumption. But compared to never
smokers, the probability of being a
light smoker 1s greater for Anglo females than males. Usually, Anglo
females are more likely than Black
females, who are more likely than
Mexican-American females, to have

Cigarette Smoking 9

ever smoked. The exception is Black
female current light smokers. Anglo
males are more likely than other
males to be current moderate-to-heavy
smokers or to have quit moderate
smoking.

SMOKING PREDICTIONS BASED ON
THREE Two-WAY INTERACTIONS

Figure 4 portrays the predicted
probabilities of smoking based on the
three two-way interactions of age, sex,
and ethnicity on cigarette smoking
as calculated from Table 3. Building
on the previous figures, we can discern
several patterns. Figure 2 showed
higher rates of current light smoking
for Blacks than other ethnic groups.
Figure 4A shows an interaction among
ethnicity, sex, age, and smoking. Black
males and females exhibit higher rates
of light smoking than their Anglo male
and female counterparts, but only in
the middle years. For example, compared to Anglo females, Black females
are less likely to be current light than
never smokers below age 25 and at
ages 65 and above (Figure 4A). But
young Anglo females are twice as
likely as Black females to be current
light than never smokers (see also
Geronimus et al., 1993). Nevertheless,
Black middle-aged males are by far
the most likely groups to smoke less
than a pack of cigarettes a day. The
chances of a 45—49 year old Black male
being a current light rather than never
smoker is 1 in 2.5; the similar probability for Mexican-American females is
just 1 in 7.

Generally, current moderate-toheavy smokers are more likely to be
male than female (see Figure 1) and
Anglo rather than Mexican-American

probability than males of being a
former rather than current moderateto-heavy smoker at all but the oldest
ages.

Royce et al. (1993) reported that
Blacks were motivated but often unsuccessful at quitting smoking. Figures
1C and 1D illustrate that Blacks, especially older males, succeed in quitting.
Because Blacks begin smoking at older
ages, relatively few young Black males
are at risk of quitting. At older ages,
however, more Blacks smoke and are
therefore at risk of quitting; many do
quit. Thus, detailed smoking distributions by age and race clarify otherwise
paradoxical findings.

One pervasive finding is that
Mexican-American females are the
most likely among sex-ethnic combinations to be never smokers. Therefore,
we find pronounced differences in
the odds ratios between MexicanAmerican females and groups who exhibit a high propensity to smoke. For
example, compared to similarly aged
Mexican-American females, Black
males aged 45-49 are about 4 times
more likely to be current light smokers
rather than never smokers; Anglo females aged 40-44 are 15 times more
likely to be current moderate-to-heavy
rather than never smokers; MexicanAmerican males aged 65 and over are
5 times more likely to be former light
than never smokers; and Anglo males
aged 55-59 are 17 times more likely to
be former moderate-to-heavy than
never smokers.

CONCLUSION

Demographic and socioeconomic
variables influence the odds of a person
being a never smoker, current smoker,
or former smoker. Past research has

Social Biology

established the consequences of smoking tobacco for the deterioration of a
person’s health and increased chances
of dying prematurely (see Elo and
Preston, 1992; Rogers and PowellGriner, 1991). Because the deleterious
long latency influences of smoking usually affect individuals most when they
are at adult ages, smoking is a critical
behavior for the maintenance of health
and long life for adults. Indeed, smoking may contribute to leukemia, peptic
ulcer disease, diabetes, and declines in
bone density, and is clearly implicated
in its association with respiratory diseases, circulatory: diseases, and cancer, especially lung cancer (see CDC,
1993b; Nam et al., 1994; Rimm et al.,
1993; Rowe and Kahn, 1987). Therefore, better understanding of the social
and demographic factors that influence
smoking behavior could result in improved ways to encourage individuals
to abstain from smoking, to reduce
their smoking, or to quit, and thereby reduce morbid conditions, chronic
diseases, and disability.

We have uncovered several smoking
patterns by age and sex. Generally, age
is curvilinearly related to smoking,
such that the probability of being a
never smoker is highest at the age extremes. At the youngest ages, before
individuals are initiated into smoking,
there are a large number of never
smokers. Thus, to maintain a high proportion of never smokers requires that
social and public health programs prevent youths from ever becoming full
initiates. At the older ages, three separate phenomena may produce a large
proportion of never smokers. First,
since smoking practices have changed
over time, older individuals may represent a cohort who never started
smoking. Individuals aged 50 and over

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

would have been adolescents, the age
group at highest risk of smoking initiation, before cigarette consumption
reached its peak, in 1963 (Ravenholt
1990). Second, older individuals who
smoked briefly or in the distant past
may consider themselves never smokers even though they do have a past
smoking history. Third, since ever
smokers have higher mortality than
never smokers, this higher mortality
may selectively kill smokers leaving
never smokers at the older ages. Most
likely the three explanations combine
to account for the high proportion of
never smokers, with the first explanation the most salient.

At younger ages, females are as
likely as males to consume high numbers of cigarettes and more likely to
consume low to moderate numbers of
cigarettes. Thus, at the younger ages,
females are not only paralleling but
are exceeding male smoking habits.
Fortunately, young females exhibit
high probabilities of quitting. If females exhibited low rates of smoking
and high rates of quitting, we would expect that subsequent lung cancer diagnosis and mortality attributed to cigarettes would be substantially lower
than, rather than close to, male rates.

There are interactions by sex and
ethnicity. Generally, never smokers
are more likely to be female and
Mexican-American; current moderateto-heavy smokers are more likely to
be male and Anglo (see also Fiore et
al., 1989). Thus, we can expect the
largest differences between MexicanAmerican females and Anglo males. In
fact, compared to Mexican-American
females aged 45-49, Anglo males at
similar ages are 33 times more likely to
be moderate-to-heavy smokers rather
than never smokers. This suggests that

Cigarette Smoking

there are substantial differences in
smoking by age, sex, and ethnicity that
must be recognized in any public
health or policy decisions.

Several studies reported high Black
motivation but low success in smoking
cessation (see Orleans et al., 1989;
Royce et al., 1993). Others have noted
that education moderates the race effects in smoking: “Education is negatively related to age of smoking onset,
amount smoked, and perceived difficulties quitting; it is positively related
to plans to quit, beliefs that smoking
is related to lung cancer and that
lung cancer would have serious consequences” (Manfredi et al., 1992, p.
268). We have shown that many Blacks
successfully quit smoking, especially at
older ages. Thus, age and education
adjustments clarify Black smoking patterns. Nevertheless, continued antismoking programs are warranted, particularly for the poor. For example,
Lacey et al. (1993) recommend that
programs deal with the root causes of
smoking, including, for example, the
unique stress, isolation, and limited social and economic resources apparent
in public housing.

Like most previous studies, we have
examined smokers at one point in time
to compare one smoking status to another. These relations illustrate how
smoking is affected by demographic
variables and other covariates, but we
have not been able to compare smoking transitions. Such comparisons,
which require longitudinal data, are
warranted for future research and
could show, for instance, the quit rates
for people at different consumption
levels.

These results can inform health
planners and policy makers. Policy decisions and health care strategies can
  

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

   

be effective at the individual or structural levels.

For examples, policies can influence
individual health behaviors, but are
mediated by demographic characteristics—age, sex, race, and ethnicity—
and also by major social institutions—
family, school, and work. Individual
smoking choices are often based on
peer norms, whether family members
smoke, and larger social norms and
values.

Structural forces can promote positive individual health behavior: the
American Cancer Society and the
American Heart Association can sponsor such programs as the Great American Smokeout; federal, state, and local governments can legislate smoking
practices; schools can teach smoking
prevention curricula; businesses can
enact policies to prevent smoking; the
media can promote anti-smoking campaigns; and health care providers can
advise smokers to quit (see CDC,
1993c; DHHS, 1991; Shopland, 1993).
Such programs help, but are dwarfed

by the advertising and influence of the
tobacco industry (Davis, 1987; Barry,
1991).

Ultimately, then, individuals themselves must opt for healthy lifestyles
free of cigarettes. This article has
further elucidated both the complex
nature and patterned responses to
smoking. By clearly elucidating the
demographic and socioeconomic variations in smoking, arguably the most
salient marker of health behavior,
we can better target programs and policies geared toward the reduction of
smoking-related diseases and deaths.
