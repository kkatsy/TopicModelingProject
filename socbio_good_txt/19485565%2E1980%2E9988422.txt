ABSTRACT: A method is presented for the analysis of deviations from random mating. Kinship,
demographic, social, and spatial characteristics observed among married couples have been compared with the distributions expected if mates were chosen at random from all possible pairs of
mates. This procedure has been used to investigate both failure to mate and patterns of assortative
mating for cohorts born on Sanday, Orkney Islands, between 1885 and 1924. Differences in mating
opportunity were observed. The 315 males who eventually married on the island differed from the
446 never-married males in birth order and sibship size as well as geographic and kinship “‘distances” measured between ego and all females available for marriage. Comparison of wives with the
potential mates of married males indicated that mating was assortative with respect to kinship,
demographic, social, and geographic characteristics. Further implications of this nonrandom pattern of mate choice are discussed and application of this method to other populations suggested.

couples into multiple categories is a risky
process, making it necessary to limit the
ways in which characteristics of the marriages, or of the individuals involved in
them, may be investigated.

The purpose of this paper is to examine
the structure of a small island population
using methods which alleviate some of the
effects of this dilemma. Extending a procedure originally developed by Dyke
(1971), we have compared genealogical
relatedness and distributions of demographic, social, and spatial characteristics
observed among married couples with distributions expected if spouses were chosen
randomly from all possible mates. The
number of potentially marriageable couples is very large, making it possible to
evaluate mating opportunity and assortative mating practices. This procedure
takes into account the demographic structure of the population and does not rely
on the assumption that married couples
are a random sample of those eligible for
marriage. In this manner, we have evaluated (1) mating opportunities with respect
to success or failure to mate and (2) patterns of assortative mating in the population of Sanday, Orkney Islands, Scotland.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sanday, one of the northern Orkney
islands located to the north of the
mainland of Scotland, was chosen for this
analysis because of its geographic and
cultural isolation, the availability of standardized civil records (1855 to the present),
and knowledge of its complex historic origins (Boyce et al., 1973). Typical of all of
Orkney, subsistence on Sanday is based
upon agriculture, supplemented by fishing
and small croft industry. The influences of
modernization on these outer islands has
been small. Although recent agricultural
innovations and home industries have introduced change into island economies

Social Biology

(Coull, 1966), much of daily life has
changed very little since 1800. As in much
of Northwestern Europe, impartible inheritance is the traditional mode of property allocation (Miller, 1976; Goldschmidt
and Kunkel, 1971). There is one heir.
Usually the eldest son obtains land rights,
and one daughter receives a dowry. The
remaining children typically do not marry
or contribute offspring to the island population. They either emigrate permanently
or remain in the community as landless laborers.

Decreased fertility and emigration
have contributed to depopulation on Sanday, in the Highland-Island area of
Scotland, and in most rural communities
of Europe (Clegg, 1976, 1977; Moisley,
1966; Rundblad, 1957). For Sanday, population growth rates were positive until
1881, when maximum census size 2,175
was attained. After this period, growth rates were negative and population size decreased to 670 by 1961. Material presented elsewhere indicates that the period
of maximum change occurred between
1881 and 1924 when the population decreased to 30 per cent of its maximum size
and the crude birth rate decreased from 18
to 6 births per thousand population (Brennan and Boyce, 1980; Brennan, 1981).
Failure to mate due to high rates of outmigration and celibacy have been observed
for all cohorts born between 1855 and
1964: (1) Only 30 to 40 per cent of each cohort married; and (2) the absolute number
and proportions of ever married individuals has decreased over time. Changes in
mating opportunity and assortative mating could be expected to have an impact
on population composition in this situation.

Dyke’s (1971) analysis of marriage
structure included characteristics of age
and kinship as recorded in a small Caribbean isolate. In addition to these factors,
we consider here birth order, sibship size,

an estimate of social distance, and geographic propinquity, since many investigations have shown the importance of
these characteristics in determining the
structure of human mating systems (see,
for example, Adams and Kasakoff, 1974;
Boyce et al., 1971; Bumpass and
Mburugu, 1978; Friedman et al., 1978;
Kuchemann et al., 1974; Mielke et al.,
1976; Schull and MacCluer, 1968). Information for individual residents of Sanday
was taken from census sources, vital records, and parish registries. Data were
collected by A. J. Boyce of the University
of Oxford, and E. R. Brennan. A record
was assembled for each of the 1,593 indi
viduals born from 1885 to 1924 which con
tained the following: calendar date and
residence at each known vital event, estimated social class of father, birth order,
size of sibship, and identification of all
known ancestors (see Brennan and
Boyce, 1980). In addition to these individual characteristics, kin relationship, difference between social classes, and distance between natal residences were
computed for husbands and wives and for
all opposite-sexed pairs who might have
married (potential mates). A male and a
female were considered to be potential
mates if:

1. Both were simultaneously within reproductive age limits (males, 18-50; females, 15-40); the female was no more than
5 years older, nor 15 years younger than the
male;

2. Both were unmarried at the time they
were matched.

3. They were not members of the same
nuclear family.

This broad definition of marital ‘‘availability” conformed quite closely to age
and kinship characteristics of married couples observed in the population (Brennan,
1981) and appears to be similar to that
found in other small rural populations in
Western countries. |

Assortative Mate Choice

 

201

Males were chosen as the basic unit of
comparison so that results would be consistent with other similar studies (Dyke,
1971; Leslie et al., 1978). Date of marriage terminated mate search for married
males. A simulated ‘‘stop date,”’ based on
mean and variance in male age at first marriage for each cohort was randomly assigned to nonmaters. Each male then
searched the entire female list for appropriate partners. Characteristics of a male
and a given potential mate were tabulated, weighted by the number of years
that the couple were available for marriage, and mean values were computed
over all potential mates of that male.
Values were then averaged for all males
considered here (thus, variances reported
in the tables are small). By comparing observed with expected values averaged for
all males we have been able to evaluate
marriage patterns in two ways:

1. Males who were known to have married on Sanday (‘‘maters”) were compared
with those who did not (“nonmaters’’) to
test the assumption that failure to mate on
the island was random with respect to the
characteristics listed above. Because our
primary interest is whether or not an individua} contributed offspring to subsequent
generations, we made no distinction between celibates and emigrants in the nonmater category. In our method, both
groups of males were matched with the
same group of potentially marriageable
women.

2. A comparison was made between
wives and potential mates of married males
in order to test whether mating on the island
was assortative with respect to given demographic, kinship, residence, and social class
measures. For a male, if mating were random, the expected value of any of these
measures in his wife can be computed from
the average of that characteristic observed
among all of his potential mates.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) 2-sample,
1-tailed tests with df=2 (Siegel, 1956)
were used to compare observed with expected cumulative distributions for each

characteristic. Within each demographic,
social, and geographic category we compared proportionate distributions of (1)
maters with nonmaters and (2) wives with
potential mates of married males. In addition, we have examined the interaction of
kinship with each of the other characteristics by comparing the proportionate distribution of relatedness within each category
of a given variable. Since information for
all characteristics was not always available
for each individual, there are slight differences in the total numbers of cases reported in the tables.

RESULTS
KINSHIP STRUCTURE

The pedigree coefficient of kinship, o,
was used to measure relatedness between
(1) husbands and wives, (2) male maters
and their potential mates, and (3) nonmaters and their potential mates. For each
pair, degree of relatedness was ascertained from pedigree information using an
algorithm which tests for the presence of a
common ancestor. Average relatedness
for each of the three groups is shown in
Table 1. The values in the table are
small, but on the average nonmaters were
more closely related to their potential ma

tes than were maters from these cohorts
(K-S 2-sample, 1-tailed test, df=2, X?=
7.54, p<0.01). Distributions of average
relatedness between pairs indicated that
although 42.5 per cent of nonmaters were
related to their potential mates as third
cousins once removed or closer, only 32.5
per cent of maters were this closely related
to their potential mates.

In addition, mate choice was preferential with respect to genealogical relatedness. Husbands were, on the average,
more closely related to their wives than to
the entire group of women who were
available to them (p<0.001). Although
not reported here, these trends were
found to be consistent for cohorts born between 1800 and 1950. Distributions of kinship are presented below in relation to social and geographic distance for males and
both their spouses and potential mates.

DEMOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE

An individual’s eligibility for marriage
is typically influenced by access to the
economic resources of his or her family.
Family economic status is likely to be related to parental fertility, of which sibship
size is a measure, while access to family resources is often a function of birth order,

sibship size. For these reasons, we have
examined the effect of sibship size and
birth order on mating patterns. From
Table 2 it can be seen that on the average,
birth order and sibship size of male maters
were less than that of nonmaters. AIthough not shown in the table, distributions of these characteristics indicated that
maters were more likely to be first born and
from small families than were nonmaters
(p<0.001). In addition, wives were of
Jower birth order than expected from distributions of potential mates (p<0.001).

Table 3 shows the interaction between
kinship and sibship size. Male sibships
were grouped into three categories: 1-3
sibs (low parental fertility), 4-6 sibs (moderate parental fertility), and 7 or more sibs
(high parental fertility). Average relatedness of maters and of nonmaters and their
potential mates did not differ significantly.
However, for both groups, males from
families of Size 4 or greater were more
likely to be related to their potential mates
than were males from smaller sibships
(p<0.001). Table 3 indicates that grooms
from large sibships married brides who
were related more often than would be expected from the distribution of potential
mates (p<0.001).

Following procedures outlined by Kuchemann et al. (1974), we have estimated
social classes for individuals by converting
occupation of each person’s father (as
listed on vital records) into one of five categories, using guidelines provided by the
1970 United Kingdom Registrar
General’s Classification of Occupations.
The highest social class was assigned a
value of 1; the lowest, 5. Table 2 indicates
that maters tended to be of slightly higher
social class than nonmaters. However,

none of the differences in the table are
significant.

For each pair, a measure of “social distance” was computed by subtracting social
class of female from social class of male.
Distances were negative if the female was
of a lower class than the male. Figure 1
shows the distribution of distances for (1)
grooms and their brides, (2) maters and
their potential mates, and (3) nonmaters
and their potential mates. Differences between maters and nonmaters with respect
to social distances between males and
their potential mates were not significant.
For a given male, most women available
for marriage were from his own class (see
Table 1). Homogamy with respect to social class was the norm. The highest proportion of marriages was between spouses
from the same social class. There was no

However, social distance between husbands and wives was greater than expected from the distribution of potential
mates (p<0.05).

Table 4 gives average relatedness of
males to their wives and their potential
mates by social class of males. No significant
differences between maters and nonmaters
were observed with respect to the distribution of relatives by social class. Although
there were differences in relatedness between maters and nonmaters, these differences were not a function of social class. For
both groups, however, lower class males
(Classes 4 and 5) were more closely related
to potential mates than were males from
higher social classes (p<0.05). In addition,
a pattern of assortative mating was observed. Grooms were more closely related

GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE

The relationship between geographic
structure and mate choice was measured
using linear distances between birth places
of members of each pair. Vital records
defined exact location of dwelling at birth
for approximately 94 per cent of the sample. Distances between males and their
wives and potential mates are shown in
Table 1 and Figure 3 (distances, shown as
midpoints of 10 km. intervals, were truncated at 90 km.). Distance played a part in
mate choice in several ways: (1) Maters
were born further away (about 10 km.)
from their potential mates than were nonmaters (p<0.001). (2) The proportion of
marriages between individuals born on
the island (less than 30 km. apart) was
greater than expected from the distribution of potential mates (p<0.001). Typically, spouses born off-island came from

larger urban populations such as Kirkwall,
the county capitol, 35 km. away, and
Edinburgh, more than 90 km. to the
south, rather than from closer small island
populations.

Figure 4 shows the interaction of spatial
distance and relatedness. For pairs born
both on- and off-island, nonmaters were
more closely related to potential mates
than were maters (p<0.05). Consanguinity of spouses was higher than expected at
very short distances (p<0.001), that is,
where both spouses had been born on the
island.

Failure to mate which was nonrandom
with respect to kinship resulted in a pattern of consanguinity avoidance. Among
cohorts born during the time examined,
nonmaters were more closely related to
their potential mates than were maters,
implying that the proportions of relatives
among one’s potential mates may play a
part in determining whether or not to
marry endogamously. Although not presented here, this trend is consistent from
about 1800 to 1950 in the Sanday population and has been observed in other small
populations. The magnitude of this effect
is small, but over time this ‘“‘avoidance’”’
pattern will reduce the effectiveness of
random inbreeding, and it temporarily
maintains levels of heterozygosity at
higher levels than would be expected if
nonmating were random with respect to
kinship. Leslie et al. (1978, 1980) have ob

served this trend and have presented an
analysis of this phenomenon for two other
small populations of European origin in
the West Indies. Brennan et al. (ms.) have
applied the Leslie model to the Sanday
population at two different time periods
and have found that the pattern described
here holds for periods prior to 1950, but is
reversed after 1950 (that is, in the most recent period maters are more closely related to their potential mates than are
nonmaters).

Maters were of lower birth order and
from smaller sibships than were nonmaters. This pattern appears to be associated
with impartible inheritance, the traditional means of allocating property in
Northwestern Europe (see, for example,
Goody, 1976; Kennedy, 1973). One consequence of this system is that ideally only
two children, one male and one female,

can expect to remain and marry within the
community. Thus, the eldest male from a
small family with few competing sibs
would have the best chances for obtaining
land rights and marrying within the population.

Differences between maters and nonmaters are small with respect to the distribution of distances to birth places of their
potential mates. Although these distances
tended to be closer for nonmaters than for
maters, it is quite likely that this is an indirect effect, related to the avoidance of
consanguinity described above. Relatives
tend to live nearby, and since nonmaters
have more relatives among their potential
mates the distribution of their distances is
skewed accordingly.

ASSORTATIVE MATING

Comparison of wives with the potential
mates of married males shows positive assortative mating for demographic characteristics and for geographical distance insofar as it is related to kinship. Males of
lower birth order and from smaller sibships married females with similar characteristics more often than would be expected. On the average, males married
relatives born closer to them than would
have been expected from the distribution
of average distances separating them from
their potential mates. These patterns too
may be related to inheritance of property.
First-borns typically have a greater chance
to inherit land rights (or a dowry) and thus
increased chances for marriage within the
population. It also appears that island
‘born individuals can increase their access

to farmland if they marry endogamously.
Negative assortative mating, in which
differences between spouses were greater
than expected from random choice of
partners from potential mates, was observed for social class, and for distances
between birthplaces of all married restdents of the island. The highest frequency

Social Biology

of marriages occurred within a given social
class. Social homogamy has been reported
for other populations (Kerchkogg, 1978;
Udry, 1971) and has been cited as evidence of positive assortative mating with
respect to social class. However, this study
has shown that the proportion of withinclass marriages is less frequent than would
be expected from the distribution of potential mates of married males. Although
not shown here, this high frequency of
marriages between persons in adjacent social classes was a consistent pattern for cohorts born between 1855 and 1964 and
may be indicative of the fluidity of class
boundaries in West European populations
(see, for example, Kuchemann et al.,
1974). The relatively high frequency of
marriages with individuals born off-island
is evidence of a pattern of isolate breakdown, detectable as early as the late nineteenth century and continuing today. It
appears that population size, density, and
neighborhood knowledge are all important factors influencing off-island mate
choice.

CONCLUSIONS

In spite of limitations typical of historical studies of population structure, such as
gaps and inconsistencies in the recording
of names and dates and uneven genealogical depth, we have been able to make a
quantitative assessment of the relationship between mate choice and population
structure. Data of the type used here are
frequently available from church and civil
registries, so that our methods are replicable in other populations and could be used
with variables other than those included
here, such as income or biometric traits.
Given the quantity of data required for
each individual and the large number of
comparisons which must be made between potential couples, these methods
are probably not practicable with large

populations. On the other hand, we suspect that despite large population aggregates, most people choose their marriage
partners from a relatively small pool of potential mates, which argues for the general
relevance of our procedures. Whereas a
number of our results are specific to Sanday, many characteristics of the islanders
are Similar to those of other small populations, for example, the finding that maters
are typically more related to potential
mates than nonmaters has been observed
elsewhere. This suggests that differences
between maters and nonmaters, and between potential mates and actual spouses,

may be a widespread phenomenon, and
may have a measurable impact on population structure.
