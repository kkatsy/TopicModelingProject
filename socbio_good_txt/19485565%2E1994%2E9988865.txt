Dimensions of Adolescent
Motherhood in India

R.S. Goyal

Population Research Centre

Chandigarh, India

ABSTRACT: The practice of early marriage of girls is still widely followed in India. The expectation in the Indian sociocultural milieu that after marriage a woman will become pregnant as
soon as possible encourages early onset of maternity and higher adolescent fertility. The
age-specific fertility rate for married Indian women 15-19 years ranged between 83 and 89 in

the last decade.

This paper attempts to assess the extent of adolescent motherhood in India. It also discusses the social, cultural, and demographic correlates of
teenage childbearing.

In the Indian sociocultural milieu,
marriage of one’s children ts obligatory
for parents, and early marriage of girls
is an accepted norm. This practice is
deep-rooted, dating back to preChristian eras (Kapadia, 1955). The
social organization and value system in
early Hindu society strongly favored
early marriage of girls, either before
puberty or immediately after puberty.

In the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, social reform
movements and legislative measures
(for example, the Sharda Act of 1929)
attempted to restrict the practice of
early marriage of girls. As is evident
from the pattern of age at marriage of
women in India shown in Table 1,
progress in this regard had been painfully slow.

Although Table 1 indicates that after the Sharda Act in 1930, age at marriage for women began an upward
trend, its rate of increase was still only
one year per decade. A large majority

of Indian girls are still married-off in
their teenage years. Moreover, Indian
social and familial conditions, generally involving joint or extended joint
family living, are such that immediately after her marriage a young bride
can scarcely consider when to have
children or how many to have. Also, at
this age, she is too young and often too
uneducated to think in these terms.
The whole pressure of her husband’s
family with whom she comes to live
and the expectation of her natal family
are that she will become pregnant as
soon as possible, and that having borne
one child, she will continue to bear

“In certain cases the nuptiality status of women was not specified. Therefore. the row total of per cent distributions does not

more (Mandelbaum, 1974). A young
bride, often illiterate in rural areas and
ignorant about her physiology and reproductive system, does not have much
choice except to do whatever she has
been told to do either by her motherin-law or husband.

In this setting, it is natural that the
incidence of adolescent motherhood is
high. Out-of-wedlock motherhood is a
taboo in India. However, it can be assumed that such pregnancies end in
abortions, often at the hand of unqualified persons, further adding to the
miseries of young women.

Table 2 indicates that in addition to
a large proportion of married adolescent girls 15-19 years of age, a number
of girls 10-14 years old were also married. It is amazing that in spite of all
the efforts to restrict it, the custom of
child marriage is still being practiced in
India.

Nuptiality statistics for Indian
women (1981 census) show that of all
currently married women 79 per cent
of rural women and 72 per cent of urban women were below the age of 20 at
the time of marriage. Educational sta
tistics for adolescents in the 1981 census show that married adolescent girls
were relatively less educated than unmarried girls in the same age group
(see Table 3).

Table 4 shows the parity of married
teenage women in India in the 1981
census. Interestingly, the proportion
of mothers was higher in urban areas
than in rural areas. Since in India rural
fertility is higher than urban fertility
(Family Welfare Planning Yearbook,
India, 1988-89), this observation appears contradictory. However, the
custom of “return marriage” which is
often observed in rural India (particularly in north India) may explain this
contradiction. In the Indian countryside, where early marriage of girls is
common, the marriage is not consummated immediately after marriage.
Consummation of the marriage generally takes place after a second ceremony called “return marriage,’’ which
is held after a certain interval of time,
sometimes several years, when the
girl is considered ready for married
life. Although, the custom of return
marriage is dying, its impact is still

significant enough (particularly in the
15-19 years age group) to explain the
fertility differentials between rural and
urban adolescent girls.

Table 4 also shows that even in the
age group of 10-14 years, a number of
girls have experienced motherhood.
Although the majority of teenage
women who had experienced childbearing wefe primipara, a number of
women had higher parity births.

The fact that in India the fertility
level in the adolescent age group is relatively higher than in other countries is
evident from the comparisons shown in
Table 5. Table 5 indicates that, except
for Bangladesh, all other countries had
a much lower level of adolescent fertility than India. Bangladesh also follows the custom of early marriage of
girls, and the proportion of married

Jess developed country is nearly 70 per

£& Girls marrying and becoming mothers so early in life are adversely af‘= fected in several ways. Several micro~ level studies in different parts of the
= world have shown that pregnancy and
3 childbearing among adolescents, espe% cially age 16 or younger, carry both
Oo ‘ < ‘
cs health and social risks, sometimes se6 rious ones. Direct obstetric complica© tions of early childbearing include obstructed labor and eclampsia, both of
which can be fatal. For those whose
pregnancy is unwanted and who try to
terminate it, illicit abortion carries extremely high risks of contracting sepsis, of hemorrhage, and of infertility
and death (Senanayake, 1990). Studies
have also shown excess maternal mortality among women younger than 20
years compared with women in their

niversit

twenties (WHO, 1986). A community
study conducted in 1982-83 in Bangladesh found that the maternal mortality rate, including abortion-related
deaths, for women 15~19 years old was
860 per 100,000 live births as compared
to 248 per 100,000 live births for
women aged 20-24 years (Alaudin,
1986).

Two factors are largely responsible
for the adverse effects of early childbearing on the health of mothers. First,
very young women are biologically immature for effective childbearing. The
development of the human pelvis is not
complete until a person attains full
stature, and among women this process
is not complete until around the age of
18. The second factor is the poor nutritional status of young mothers. It has
been observed that undernutrition during and prior to pregnancy can be
highly dangerous. For example, deficiencies of iron, folic acid, and other
vitamins reduce the level of hemoglobin in the blood, which increases the
mother’s risk of anemia. Royston
(1982) reported a high incidence of
anemia among young women in Kenya
and Bangladesh. In India the nutritional status of young girls is sometimes lower than that of their brothers
because of various sociocultural reasons (Basu, 1989).

Adolescent motherhood leads to social and cultural problems also. Most
notably, early marriage and motherhood reduces whatever few opportunities girls in India have for seeking
education. Table 3 shows that in the
10-19 years age group, educational attainments of married girls were significantly lower than those of unmarried
girls.
