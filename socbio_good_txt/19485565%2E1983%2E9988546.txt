Contraceptive Use and Efficacy in a Genetically
Counseled Population

ABSTRACT: This paper reports contraceptive use and efficacy rates among 648 married women
aged 15 to 44 who had received genetic counseling six months previously. Over half (53.5 per
cent) of the counseled population were using non-surgical contraception; 20 per cent were pregnant or postpartum; 10 per cent were seeking to become pregnant; 11 per cent were sterilized.
Only 4.5 per cent were neither using contraceptives nor seeking to become pregnant. Women
who were certain about their reproductive intentions after counseling utilized contraceptives
effectively, with only two pregnancies at six months among those seeking to delay wanted pregnancies and only one pregnancy among those seeking to prevent pregnancy. This represents
six-month contraceptive failure rates of 4.3 and 2.1 per cent respectively for the two groups,
rates similar to those with comparable intentions in the U.S. population at large. A distinguishing characteristic of the genetically counseled group was that 32 per cent of contraceptive users
reported that their reproductive intentions were uncertain after counseling. The six-month

pregnancy rate in this uncertain group was 10 per cent.

A major objective of genetic counseling is to provide patients with medical
and genetic information so they make
informed reproductive decisions (Fraser, 1974). Actual pregnancy and birth
rates in genetically counseled populations will reflect not only the medical
and genetic knowledge of counseled patients, but in addition, the effectiveness
with which counseled populations use
contraceptives.

Elsewhere we have reported the
change and stability in the reproductive
intentions of women who receive genetic counseling (Sorenson et al., 1981)
and have examined the relationships
among the level of risk of having a child
with a birth defect, the burden imposed
by a birth defect, and the reproductive
intentions of genetically counseled
women (Sorenson et al., 1982, ms.). In
this report we turn our attention to the
use of contraceptives among a genetically counseled population six months
following counseling.

Genetic counseling is a tertiary service provided by M.D. or PhD. specialists in clinical genetics. Clients may be
referred to counseling by their physicians because they have already borne a
child with a birth defect, have an affected relative, have suffered exposure
to toxic agents, or are concerned about
consanguinity or maternal age. The clients’ greatest concern is usually whether
they should have a(nother) child. Counseling may include a discussion of their
risk of having an affected child, the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the
disorder, and occasionally social factors
such as the cost of raising an affected
child or its effects on the marriage. Most
clients are seen by the counselor once.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our clinic target population for this
study consisted of 80 clinics receiving
service funds from the March of Dimes
Birth Defects Foundation in 1976. Of

Vol. 30, No. 3

the 80 clinics, 47, or 59 per cent, located
in 25 states and the District of Columbia, provided us with clients. Only those
clients who came to genetic counseling
for the first time, who received actual
counseling as opposed to diagnostic
workups, and who were Englishspeaking were included. Cases were ascertained until a clinic had either contributed 50 clients to the study or had
participated for a year, whichever came
first.

Using this procedure, a total of 1,773
genetic counseling cases, whether involving a single person, a couple, or a
family, were designated as eligible for
the study. Clients in 1,369 cases or 77.2
per cent chose to participate and returned the pre-counseling data forms.
The 1,369 cases included 1,314 female
clients and 906 male clients. Clients constituted a couple in 1,095 cases (80 per
cent), a lone female in 246 cases (18 per
cent) and a lone male in 27 cases (2 per
cent).

Of the 2,220 clients who completed
pre-counseling questionnaires, 1,099 female clients (83.6 per cent) and 752 male
clients (83.0 per cent), representing
1,096 cases, returned a post-counseling
questionnaire, usually within ten days
after the counseling session.

On account of resource limitations,
only 1,661, or 90 per cent of those who
returned the post-counseling questionnaire were asked to return a follow-up
questionnaire six months after counseling. Of those asked, 808 female clients
(82.2 per cent) and 548 male clients
(80.8 per cent) returned follow-up questionnaires.

A detailed analysis, comparing clients who remained in the study at six
months with those who did not, in regard to socio-demographic variables
and disease characteristics revealed only

for females, and none for males. More
female clients who remained in the
study had post-graduate education (28.5
per cent compared to 18.5 per cent) and
had higher status occupations; fewer (64
per cent versus 71.1 per cent) had had an
affected child before coming to counseling. Clients retained through the sixmonth follow-up were virtually identical
to the total female population at entrance to the study in terms of (a) reproductive plans: (b) pregnancy status; and
(c) per cent coming to genetic counseling to obtain information to assist in reproductive planning (Sorenson et al.,
1981).

All three questionnaires, precounseling, post-counseling, and sixmonth follow-up, asked for detailed information on short- and Jong-term
reproductive plans and knowledge
about diagnosis and risk. The precounseling questionnaire also solicited
client reasons for coming to counseling,
and the post-counseling and six-month
questionnaires ascertained demographic information and contraceptive
usage. The analysis of reproductive
plans presented in this paper is limited
to the information gathered from female
clients who remained in the study six
months.

RESULTS

The genetically counseled group differed from the U.S. female population
surveyed in the National Surveys of
Family Growth (NSFG) (Mosher, 1981;
Vaughn et al., 1980) in many demographic traits relevant to contraceptive
use and efficacy. For example, 55.5 per
cent of the genetically counseled group,
but only 44 per cent of the NSFG population, was between the ages of 25 and
34, while 13.1 per cent of the genetically
counseled population and 34 per cent of
 

 

330

the NSFG population was between 35
and 44. The genetically counseled group
included far more women with more
than a high-school education, 54 per
cent as opposed to only 30 per cent in
the NSFG survey. Only 13 per cent of
the counseled group had less than a
high-school education, as opposed to
25.3 per cent of the NSFG population.
The genetically counseled group was not
only younger and better-educated than
— the general population, but was also
S much more active reproductively. Im3 2 mediately after counseling, as indicated
E in Table 1, over 20 per cent of the coun® seled group was either pregnant or postoo partum, compared with only 6.8 per
> cent of the general population; over 10
per cent of the counseled group was
seeking to become pregnant, as opposed to 6.5 per cent of the general population. Only 11.1 per cent of the counseled group or their husbands had been
surgically sterilized, as opposed to 28.2
per cent of the general population.
Clearly, those who go to genetic coun5 seling include few who have completed

At six months post-counseling, 53.5
per cent of the genetically counseled
group were using non-surgical methods
of contraception, as opposed to 49.2 per
cent of the U.S. population. Only 4.5
per cent of fertile women in the counseled group were neither using contraceptives nor actively seeking to become
pregnant. This included 17 women (2.7
per cent) who reported that they did not
believe in contraception.

The methods used by the counseled
group are reported in Table 2. In general, they used these methods at rates
similar to the national population, with
slightly lower use rates for the most reliable methods (pill and IUD) and for the
least reliable methods (rhythm and
withdrawal). The choice of methods
perhaps reflects the higher level of education among those counseled; women
with more than a high-school education
are less likely to use rhythm or withdrawal, and in recent years have also
turned to methods other than the pill as
they read of its potential adverse effects
on health.

time that she either (1) intended to have
no more children (a possible failure in
quantity); or (2) intended to have a child
but not within the two years following
counseling (a failure in timing).

At six months post-counseling, the
failure rate for the first group was 2.1 per
cent (one reported pregnancy) and for
the second group, 4.3 per cent (two reported pregnancies). For the U.S. population, failure rates (adjusted to a sixmonth basis) for those seeking to
prevent an “unwanted” pregnancy were
2.5 per cent and for those seeking to delay a wanted pregnancy were 3.7 per
cent. As the genetically counseled group
included a far greater number of women
with college and post-graduate educa
tion than the NSFG survey, we would
expect that their failure rates would be
lower, as contraceptive efficacy increases among women with more than a
high-school education (Vaughn et al.,
1980). This was not the case. Among the
““‘reproductively uncertain”’ group,
there were 11 pregnancies. These cannot be considered contraceptive failures
as they may have resulted from changes
in reproductive uncertainty.

Table 6 reports the genetic and medical characteristics associated with the 14
pregnancies reported six months after
counseling by immediate postcounseling contraceptors. It is not
known how many of these pregnancies
were carried to term.

DISCUSSION

These are the first prospective data
on contraceptive use and efficacy in a genetically counseled population, a special
population in whom effective contraceptive practice is very important.

Subsequent to genetic counseling, 92
per cent of the counseled women in this
study intending to avoid an immediate
pregnancy were contracepting. In general, they were employing the more reliable methods of contraception.

Among counseled women with
definite reproductive intentions to delay
or prevent pregnancy, contraceptive
failure rates were low and roughly similar to rates among those with similar intentions in the general population. In
view of the fact that 54 per cent of the
counseled population had more than a

high-school education, however, their
contraceptive failure rates should have
been lower.

A major characteristic of the counseled group was that 32 per cent of the
344 contraceptive users emerged from
counseling with uncertain reproductive
intentions. Together, these data suggest
that contraceptive use is very effective
among counseled women with definitive
reproductive plans, but there may be a
problem of effective use among women
with uncertain reproductive intentions.
Further research could clarify if such
pregnancies are contraceptive failures,
or the result of a change in pregnancy
plans. In the meantime, counselors
should be aware of the high percentage
of clients who leave counseling uncertain of their reproductive intentions,
and of the high pregnancy rate among
this group.
