Erratum: Louis Munan and Anthea Kelly, ‘‘Frequencies of Fatal
Congenital Anomalies of the Nervous System: Association with

Latitude,’’ Vol. 26, No. 4, 1979

In Louis Munan and Anthea Kelly,
“Frequencies of Fatal Congenital Anomalies of the Nervous System: Association
with Latitude’? (Social Biology 26:
335-340), an error in Table 1 occurred as a
result of Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficients and the corresponding proba
78

bilities beginning in the first column (Latitude) instead of the second. In addition,
five of the correlation coefficients should
have shown a minus sign. We regret this
typographical error and reproduce the
corrected table on the following page.
