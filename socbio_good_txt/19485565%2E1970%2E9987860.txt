Summary of Human Population Genetics Research Support
by the Department of Health, Education,

and Welfare: 1967, 1968

National Institute of Child Health and Development
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
Bethesda, Maryland

Research in medical population genetics
supported by NIH and other segments of
DHEW in fiscal years 1967 and 1968 is
included in this brief review. Excluded was
the other side of medical genetics—the
search for remedies for genetic diseases.

The following categories, based on Murphy’s outline (1968)—with some modifications—were used in classifying DHEW research grants in human population genetics,

A. Modes of Inheritance: includes research into the modes of inheritance of
genetic traits (dominance, recessiveness, Xlinkage) and methodology for detection of
heterozygotes.

B. Genetic Population Surveys: includes
research on patterns of inheritance that are
not readily discernible (e.g., through measurement of the distribution of a trait in
different populations); surveys of populations to obtain gene frequencies, mutation
rates, genetic linkage, and recombination
rates.

C. Combination of A and B above: includes research on traits in which the mode
of inheritance is known, but modifications
in classical segregation ratios must be explained by use of genetic theory. This
category includes studies on natural selection, pleiotropy, penetrance, chromosome
analysis, and blood group incompatibilities.

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the DHEW
research grants in human population genet
 

ics by organizational unit and by category
of research.

Table 3 shows data on NICHD research
grants in human population genetics by
program area. The projects in population
genetics supported by NICHD cover a
variety of research areas. One group of
studies is concerned with the incidence and
pathophysiology of inborn errors of metabolism and includes screening programs for the
detection of heterozygotes for galactosemia,
hydroxyprolinemia, and phenylalanemia. In
another group the focus is on the inheritance
of blood groups and protein factors, ABO
incompatibility, and the genetic and biochemical aspects of hemoglobinopathies. A
third group deals with the genetic aspects of
development mechanisms involved in congenital malformations. Included in this
group are studies on cleft lip and palate
in specific populations, cytogenetics of
spontaneous abortions, and morphological
changes in human chromosomes associated
with developmental anomalies. A few isolated studies are concerned with a computerized system of chromosomal analysis,
genetic factors in children with asthma, and
the effect of aging on macromolecular information of the cell.
