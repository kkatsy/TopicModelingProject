ABSTRACT: Only limited fertility and general reproductive health data exist on American
Indians. Using data from the 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment, we
found that the fertility of American Indians in Great Falls and on the Blackfeet Reservation was
similar to blacks in the U.S. and relatively high when compared with fertility of whites in the
United States. The influence of the direct determinants of fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive
use, and lactation) was very different for the populations examined in this study. Great Falls
American Indians and the U.S. black population were similar regarding age at first sexual
intercourse (very young), breastfeeding (low prevalence and short duration), planning status of
pregnancies (high unplanned), and contraceptive use (only moderate use). In contrast,
Blackfeet women on the reservation and the U.S. white population married relatively late, had
very high contraceptive use, used effective methods of contraception, and had moderately high
levels of breastfeeding. However, Blackfeet fertility was much higher than that of whites. Three
interrelated reasons are suggested as possible explanations. Blackfeet couples either wanted
high fertility, were relatively poor users of family planning methods, or used less effective
methods until they had exceeded their desired family size after which time they turned to
sterilization. These finds raise numerous questions concerning the social and economic factors
that may account for these group similarities and differences. Further studies with much larger
data sets are needed to address these issues adequately.

tion of American Indian households do
not have telephones, a face-to-face survey design had to be considered.

To address these problems, the Billings Area IHS Office proposed a study
that would include both on- and offreservation Indians and a face-to-face
survey design. The targeted population
was American Indian men and women
15—49 years old living in two geographic
locations of the Billings Area of IHS:
the Blackfeet Reservation (on-reservation) and metropolitan Great Falls,
Montana (off-reservation). A study was
designed to collect information on behavioral risk factors, including hypertension, exercise, smoking, and alcohol
consumption, as well as reproductive
health data covering general maternal—
child-health and family-planning topics
among American Indians in these two
areas. This study, the 1987 Montana
American Indian Health Risk Assessment, had the following objectives:

(1) To collect population-based prevalence data related to behavioral risks
and reproductive health for American Indian males and females;

(2) To identify subgroups (sex, age, onvs. off-reservation) in special need of

health promotion and disease prevention intervention programs;

(3) To collect baseline prevalence data
that can be used to follow trends and
evaluate interventions.

This paper will focus on the reproductive health data collected from
American Indian females in the 1987
Montana American Indian Health Risk
Assessment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING DESIGN

The 1987 Montana American Indian
Health Risk Assessment was a health

Social Biology

study designed to include on- and offreservation American Indians. The
study population included American Indian women 15-49 years of age, living
on the Blackfeet Reservation or residing
in Great Falls, Montana. Separate samples were drawn on- and offreservation. The on-reservation sample
was drawn from the Blackfeet Tribal
Enrollment List; only those with current
addresses on the reservation were included. The off-reservation sample was
drawn from a list of American Indians in
Great Falls, Montana; this list was obtained from the service records of the
Native American Center in Great Falls.
The Native American Center estimates
that 80-85 per cent of all American Indians in Great Falls are on their list. The
lists were the most appropriate means
available for achieving coverage of both
the on- and off-reservation American
Indian population in the geographic areas included in this study. A stratified,
systematic, random sample was selected
from each list.

Each of the subpopulations studied
had between 2,000 and 2,200 eligible respondents. The sample drawn from
each group was expected to yield about
125 completed interviews. The sample
size was limited because of budget constraints and the 6-week time frame for
the fieldwork. However, the sample size
is sufficiently large to adequately evaluate behavioral health risks and reproductive health behavior in each subpopulation, as well as the feasibility of
interviewing on- and off-reservation
American Indians.

The interviews were conducted in the
home rather than on the telephone or by
mail. Nearly 40 per cent of the American Indian households on the Blackfeet
Reservation and in Great Falls do not
have telephones. All interviewers were

the Blackfeet Reservation, and 116

feet women (81 per cent) than women in
Great Falls (73 per cent). These completion rates are consistent with those from RESULTS

the 1982 and 1988 NSFG’s (Bachrach et
al., 1985). The overall completion rate
in both the 1982 and 1988 NSFG was 79
per cent. In the 1988 NSFG, the completion rate in large urban areas was 73 per
cent compared to 85 per cent in rural areas.

We compared the reproductive
health data from the 1987 Montana
American Indian Health Risk Assessment, where possible, with U.S. data
collected in the 1982 NSFG (Pratt et al.,
1984). The 1982 NSFG was a representative study of females 15 to 44 years old
residing in the United States (excluding
women in Alaska and Hawaii and
women in institutions). In the 1982

Because the Blackfeet Tribal Enrollment List was used, all respondents selected in the reservation sample were
Blackfeet (almost all reservation Indians were Blackfeet). However, in Great
Falls a variety of tribes were represented. The primary tribes (selfidentified) were Chippewa-Cree (27 per
cent), Little Shell (23 per cent), Blackfeet (14 per cent), Assiniboine (13 per
cent), and Chippewa (6 per cent). Because of the small number of respondents in each tribe, tribe-specific data in
Great Falls are not presented in this paper.

ported being currently married or living
in union with someone (Table 2). American Indians in Great Falls had younger
singulate mean age at first marriage
(SMAM = 20 years) than on the reservation (SMAM = 24 years). These ages
compare with 23 years for whites and 26
years for blacks in the United States.
Nearly half of each American Indian
group had less than a high-school diploma. Both American Indian groups
had less education than did whites or
blacks in the United States.

SEXUAL EXPERIENCE, FERTILITY, AND
BREASTFEEDING

American Indians, aged 15 to 44
years, both in Great Falls (95 per cent)
and on the reservation (90 per cent),
were slightly more likely to have had
sexual intercourse than were whites (86
per cent) in the general U.S. population, but had about the same likelihood

as blacks (90 per cent) (Table 3). In each
age group, Great Falls had the highest
rate of sexual experience of the four
groups. The bottom panel of Table 3
shows the per cent distribution of age at
first intercourse for each group. More
than half the American Indians in Great
Falls and on the reservation had had sex
by age 17; in comparison 28 per cent of
whites in the United States had had sex
by age 17. The distribution of age at first
sex for blacks in the United States was
similar to that of the American Indian
groups in this study.

Only limited fertility data are available for American Indians in the United
States. Most of these data are from the
decennial census. The 1980 census
shows that American Indians had higher
fertility than did whites or blacks in the
United States on the basis of data containing the average number of children
who were ever born to women aged 35

to 44 years (a measure of completed fertility, Table 4). In the same table, American Indians in Montana show slightly
higher estimated completed fertility
than all American Indians in the United
States (4.2 vs. 3.5 children). Results
from the present study show the average
number of children ever born to women
35 to 44 years of age on the reservation
and in Great Falls to be similar (3.4 vs.
3.3) to that of all American Indians
found in the 1980 U.S. census (3.5), but
lower than that of Montana American
Indians as found in the 1980 census
(4.2).

Breastfeeding, as a direct determinant of fertility, lengthens a woman’s
period of infecundability after a birth
and thus can increase the interval between pregnancies. In 1980-81, the incidence of breastfeeding among American Indians in Great Falls was lower
than that of whites in the Untied States
but similar to that of blacks (Table 5).

Only 25 per cent of the mothers in Great
Falls breastfed their last child. In comparison, 57 per cent of whites and 24 per
cent of blacks breastfed their last child.
Forty per cent of the mothers on the reservation breastfed their last child; this
number is intermediate to whites and
the other two groups. Breastfeeding was
most common on the reservation for
those women with more than 12 years of
schooling (53 per cent); this pattern is
similar to that found in the United States
in the early 1980’s.

The next few tables focus on the planning status of the last pregnancy for each
woman who gave birth in the 5 years before the survey date. We use planning
status to categorize pregnancies by
whether they were planned, mistimed,
or unwanted. Mistimed pregnancies are
timing failures, whereas pregnancies in
excess of the number wanted are considered “unwanted.” The sum of mistimed
and unwanted pregnancies represents

Fourteen per cent of all last pregnancies were unwanted on the reservation,
as were 20 per cent in Great Falls (Table
6). Nearly half the pregnancies on the
reservation but only 36 per cent of those
in Great Falls were planned. Older
women in both locations reported a
higher percentage of planned pregnancies than did younger women; this finding is consistent with the usual positive
relationship between per cent of births
that are planned and parity. Young
women aged 15 to 29 had a high proportion of timing failures (on the reservation, 54 per cent; in Great Falls, 45 per
cent). The per cent of pregnancies that
were unplanned (mistimed + unwanted) was similar for American Indians in Great Falls and for blacks in the
United States, but the per cent of unplanned pregnancies for whites in the
United States was lower (Table 7). The
per cent of unplanned pregnancies for
American Indians on the reservation is
intermediate to that of whites and the

had higher levels of unplanned last pregnancies than did whites in the United
States.

CONTRACEPTION

Table 8 shows the prevalence of contraceptive use for currently married females 15 to 44 years of age. Contraceptive use reported by American Indians
on the reservation was very high (79 per
cent) compared with that reported in
Great Falls (58 per cent). However, the
method-mixes for the two groups were
similar: female sterilization was the
most prevalent method used (over 30
per cent for each group), followed by
the pill (23 per cent on the reservation
and 17 per cent in Great Falls). IUD’s
were the third most prevalent method
used on the reservation (10 per cent),
but no one reported using the IUD in
Great Falls.

Several points can be made when
comparing contraceptive use of American Indians to that of the U.S. total population (Table 8). First, total use was
higher among American Indians on the
reservation (79 per cent) than among
whites in the United States (69 per
cent), and use among American Indians

sterilized; these averages were similar to
the average of blacks. Whites had 2.7
children on average when they were
sterilized. In both Great Falls and on the
reservation, even when we control for
age, women who were sterilized had a
higher average number of children ever
born than those who were not sterilized
(Table 10). In Great Falls the difference
was more than one child on average,
whereas on the reservation by age 3549, the difference was only 0.3 children.
Apparently, those women who were
sterilized were self-selected because of
their early and fairly rapid childbearing.
These women tended to have reached
their desired family size at an early age
and then decided sterilization was their
best means of controlling fertility.

TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL UsE DuRING
PREGNANCY

Statistics on whether the women consumed alcohol or smoked cigarettes during their last pregnancy are presented in
Table 11. These behaviors have the potential to affect the health of American
Indian mothers and their babies. Females in Great Falls were much more
likely than those on the reservation to
smoke or drink during pregnancy.
Nearly 60 per cent in Great Falls
smoked cigarettes during their last pregnancy and 36 per cent consumed alcohol. In contrast, on the reservation, onethird smoked cigarettes during their last
pregnancy and 14 per cent consumed alcohol. The per cent of whites and blacks
who smoked during their last pregnancy
(28 per cent for each) was similar to that
of American Indians on the reservation
(33 per cent), but was much lower than
that of American Indians in Great Falls
(59 per cent). Whites were much more
likely to drink during pregnancy than
were any of the other groups, whereas

American Indians 79

drinking among blacks was similar to
that of American Indians in Great Falls.
American Indians on the reservation
were the least likely to have consumed
alcohol during their last pregnancy. Cigarette smoking was high both in Great
Falls and on the reservation for all the

‘education categories, but for both

groups alcohol consumption declined as
education increased.

DISCUSSION

Only limited fertility and general reproductive health data exist on American Indians. Most fertility estimates are
limited to U.S. census data, and data on
reproductive health factors such as contraceptive use and breastfeeding are almost nonexistent. To partially fill this
void, the Indian Health Service responded to requests from two American
Indian health agencies in Montana
(Blackfeet Tribal Health Department
and Native American Center, Great
Falls) to collect behavioral risk and reproductive health data for male and female American Indians, using a
household-based, face-to-face survey
design. The 1987 Montana American
Indian Health Risk Assessment proved
successful in terms of collecting the
needed behavioral risk and reproductive health data. From the reproductive
health data, two important questions
can be answered:

1. Does fertility differ for on- and offreservation American Indians, and how
does American Indian fertility compare
with that of whites and blacks in the
United States?

2. How does the influence of the direct
determinants of fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive use, lactation, and abortion)
compare among American Indians,
whites, and blacks?

The first question, concerning fertility differentials among the groups, is restricted, because of data limitations, toa
measure of completed fertility (the average number of children who were ever
born to women aged 35-44 years). Unfortunately, the sample size was not
large enough to compute reliable current fertility rates. Results from the 1987
Montana American Indian Health Risk
Assessment suggest that the fertility of
American Indians in Great Falls and on
the Blackfeet Reservation is similar to
that of blacks in the United States, and
relatively high when compared with that
of whites in the United States.

The second question, which focuses
on a comparison of the direct determinants Of fertility among the groups, is
based on early work done by Davis and
Blake (1956) and recent studies by Bongaarts (1978, 1982) and Bongaarts and
Potter (1983). Davis and Blake suggested that social, economic, and cultural factors operate through, and only
through, intermediate fertility variables
to affect fertility. Bongaarts, in attempting to measure and model Davis and
Blake’s scheme, refined the original set
of 11 variables to include four factors he
called the proximate determinants of
fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive use,
lactation, and abortion). Variations in
the importance of the proximate determinants can either account for group
fertility differences or explain how
groups with similar fertility levels
reached equality. Using the scheme suggested by Bongaarts, we can compare
the relative influence of three proximate
determinants (nuptiality, contraceptive
use, and lactation) on the fertility of four
groups: Blackfeet American Indians,
Great Falls American Indians, U.S.
blacks, and U.S. whites. Data on abor
American Indians

81

tion were not available for the American
Indian groups.

The two American Indian groups had
similar fertility levels (3.4 and 3.3 average number of children who were ever
born), but the importance of the proximate determinants is very different.
Blackfeet females on the reservation
tended to marry relatively late
(SMAM = 24 years), had very high
contraceptive use (79 per cent), used effective methods (35 per cent used female sterilization), and had moderately
high levels of breastfeeding (40 per cent
breastfed their last child). These findings suggest a pattern for each of these
factors that would be consistent with low
fertility. So why was fertility high for the
Blackfeet? We hypothesize that the primary reason for this apparent anomaly
is that although a very large per cent of
married Blackfeet females had been
sterilized, the mean number of live
births among those sterilized was high
(3.4 births). Therefore, this high use of
very effective contraception occurred
too late to keep their lifetime fertility at
a low level. Blackfeet couples either had
high desired fertility levels, were relatively poor users of family planning
methods, or used less effective methods
until they had exceeded their desired
family size (14 per cent of last births
were unwanted), after which time the
female turned to sterilization. A second
potentially important contributor to the
high Blackfeet fertility may have been
teenage fertility. Sexual activity tends to
start early among the Blackfeet. More
than three-fourths of the Blackfeet aged
15-24 years had had intercourse. Following this, the number of children who
were born among 15- to 24-year-old
American Indians was higher than that
for whites or blacks in the same age

group.

For Great Falls American Indians,
the direct determinants of fertility are
consistent with relatively high fertility.
Contraceptive use among married
women was relatively low. Average age
at first marriage was quite young
(SMAM = 20 years). Maybe even more
importantly, sexual activity tended to
begin younger than it does in the general
U.S. population. In addition, breastfeeding incidence was low. Not only do
these factors lead to high fertility, they
also create a high level of unintended
pregnancy. Sixty-four per cent of the
pregnancies were unplanned, and 20 per
cent of the pregnancies were unwanted;
these proportions are almost twice as
high as those in the total U.S. population.

The relatively high fertility of blacks
was due largely to low contraceptive use
(60 per cent) and low incidence of
breastfeeding. Blacks tended to marry
late (SMAM = 26 years), but over
three-fourths of blacks aged 15-24 years
had had sexual intercourse. Therefore,
the risk of having an unplanned pregnancy was very high for blacks; this risk
is supported by the fact that 61 per cent
of their last pregnancies were unplanned.

In contrast to the other three groups,
whites were doing many things that contribute to low fertility. Whites tended to
marry reasonably late (SMAM = 23
years), had high contraceptive use (69
per cent) and had high use of female and
male sterilization, and were more likely
to breastfeed than were any of the other
groups. Also, whites who used sterilization had much lower fertility than did
the sterilized women in the three other
groups.

Social Biology

How does the influence of the direct
determinants of fertility compare
among the two America Indian groups
and the whites and blacks? Several similarities exist between the Great Falls
American Indians and the black population of the United States. These two
groups appear very much alike regarding age at first sexual intercourse (very
young), breastfeeding (low prevalence
and short duration), planning status of
pregnancies (high unplanned), and contraceptive use (only moderate use). This
may be a reflection of how urbanization
affects poor minority groups in the U.S.
Also, the many diverse tribes represented in Great Falls may make adherence to cultural norms much more difficult in urban areas than on
reservations. The Blackfeet results,
however, do not conform closely to either U.S. blacks or whites or to the urban Indians examined. These findings
raise numerous questions concerning
the social and economic factors that account for these group similarities and
differences. Further studies with much
larger data sets are needed to address
these issues adequately.

The 1987 Montana American Indian
Health Risk Assessment provides important information on the health and
demographic characteristics of a select
group of Plains American Indians, a
very important ethnic group in the
United States for which many of these
data have been lacking. This study also
demonstrates that a household survey of
American Indians, both on- and offreservation, is possible. Future surveys
are planned by the Indian Health Service to obtain similar behavioral risk and
reproductive health data among other
American Indian populations.
