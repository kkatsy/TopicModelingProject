Communications

Lalor Foundation Research Fellowship

Program for 1975

The Lalor Foundation has announced
its program for 1975 of postdoctorate
grants for research in its special areas of
interest in mammalian reproductive physiology.

The Foundation will make grants up to
$13,000 each to qualified tax-exempt institutions for conduct of approved projects
up to one year. Foreign institutions can in
general achieve a similar eligibility.

The applicant institution has the obligation and freedom to make its own designation of a Lalor Fellow for conduct of the
research from among its own personnel or
elsewhere. The Fellow designated should
have achievement at least equivalent to the
Ph.D, or M.D. degree. Upper age limit is

 

in no case over 35 years.

Applications are restricted to research
projects bearing on (a) early amniocentesis in fetal development, or other means
for detection and evaluation of dysgenic
factors or prospects of congenital disabilities, and means toward their disposition;
or (b) uterine and cervical physiology and
phenomena relevant to pregnancy interruption, particularly for second trimester
terminations.

Forms and details for institution application are available from the Lalor Foundation, 4400 Lancaster Pike, Wilmington,
Delaware, 19805. Deadline for filing is
January 15, 1975. Appointments will be
announced March 15, 1975.

Information Sought on Indigenous Fertility

Regulation Methods

We are compiling materials related to
indigenous fertility regulating methods.
Both fertility-limiting and fertility-enhancing practices are of interest. We would particularly like to know of any relevant unpublished field data, including descriptions
of methods, physiological route of intake,
and organic composition of medicines or
other substances. Especially important for
our purposes are the perceived advantages
and also the perceived undesirable attributes of such methods from the population’s point of view (users and nonusers)

as well as some estimate of the prevalence
of each method in various subgroups. Where
modern fertility-regulating technology has
been introduced, reactions leading to its
success or failure and speculation as to
whether such success or failure was due to
program organization or to intrinsic characteristics of the method(s) itself would be
extremely useful. Any contributions will be
most appreciated. Write to Dr. Lucile
Newman, Department of International
Health, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143.
