Movement of the Frequencies of
Congenital Malformations in
Time and Space

Prague, Czechoslovakia

The frequency of congenital malformations (CM) reflects the presence of teratogenic and/or mutagenic agents in the
environment, in addition to other factors
playing a role in the polygenic multifactorial system. Thus, changes in the frequency of CM may indicate variations of
known teratogens (rubella) and mutagens
(irradiation), or lead to the discovery of
unknown ones (Contergan till 1962).
These changes are probably represented by
a spectrum of movements being closely
related to the strength and natural occurrence of teratogens and/or mutagens.
Several studies treating this problem have
been published (Petersen, 1934; McKeown
and Record, 1951; Kratchman and Grahn,
1959; Edwards, 1961, 1964; Keselman
and Bailar, 1964; Lenz, 1965; Annonation
in Lancet, 1964).

It is the purpose of this paper to (1)
show how malformation frequencies fluctuate in time and space, (2) propose definitions for these types of movements, and
(3) demonstrate the value of studying
these changes.

 

MOVEMENTS IN TIME
LONG-TERM MOVEMENT

This is a continuous increase or decrease
in the frequency of a CM. As a rule it is
slow and lasts for decades. Two examples
demonstrate this type of movement.

During the past fifteen years the frequency of CM of the central nervous
system (CNS) in the State of New York
decreased by 50-60%. The reasons for
the decline in frequency of these CM
remain obscure (Gittelsohn and Milham,
1962). Genetic or environmental factors
were not obvious. It seems also that the
age of the mothers could not play a decisive role in influencing the decrease in
frequency. Only an increase in birth rates
in the south (up 59.5% from 1945 to
1959) was notable, in comparison with
the relatively small increase in birth rates
in the north of the state (up 14.7%,
compared to a rise of 27.8% in the westerm part of the state). Perhaps just in
this demographic change may lie the key
to the explanation of movements in the
frequency of CNS CM. The cause might
be related to the influence of emigration of

population(s) genetically predisposed to
the development of anencephalus, or to
the influence of newly introduced ethnic
groups or other unknown effects arising
from the life-style changes after the second
world war.

As another example, the decrease in
pyloric stenosis frequency in Sweden can
be used (Wallgren, 1960) (Table 2). This

movement was observed in the population
of Gothenburg. The resultant difference
calculated for 83,873 births was statistically significant. In this case also, yearly
differences were not pronounced, and some
transient increase in frequency during this
period may even be noted. The trend,
however, is definite. It was observed not
only in Sweden, but also in other European countries. The cause of this longterm one-way movement is unknown.

It is of interest to examine Down’s
syndrome in thinking of long-term movement of CM. In this instance, incidence
is known to correlate with mother’s age
(see Table 3). Thus, in a population like

that of Czechoslovakia where the number
of women giving birth after age 35 has
declined over the past thirty years to onehalf its former value, it is logical to assume that the incidence of Down’s syndrome has also declined over the same
time period.

PRONOUNCED LIMITED DEVIATIONS

This is a relatively rapid elevation in the
common frequency of a certain CM to
several times its standard value and relatively rapid decline of this elevation. The
length of the deviation varies from several
weeks or months to several years.

The deviation of CM frequency in
Australia in 1940 led to the identification
of the rubella virus as a teratogen. It
lasted as long as the preceding rubella
epidemic was active. Another example is
the increase in the frequency of microcephalus in Hiroshima (Plummer, 1952)
and Nagasaki (Yamazaki, Wright and
Wright, 1954). This movement is generally ascribed to the effect of irradiation
released by the explosion of the A-bomb.
Its duration was very short. The epidemics
of phocomelia in countries where thalidomide (Contergan) was administered (Lenz,
1965) could serve as a further instance.
The hitherto not fully elucidated relations
between the drug and the intrinsic environment of the pregnant woman and/or
fetus cannot weaken the conclusion that

limbs in the years 1961-62 was this particular medication. Another example is the
increase of anencephalus, spina bifida, and
hydrocephalus in some parts of Germany
during World War II and for about
five years thereafter. Later, the number
of these types of CM returned to normal,
having at their peaks reached three to
four times the original figures (Eichmann
and Gesenius, 1952; Nowak, 1950; Pfau
and Trager, 1962; Winter and Patz, 1958).
No explanation for this type of movement
is available. Changes in the age structure
of mothers cannot explain these findings,

while other factors like undernourishment
and stress were not objectively measured
and therefore cannot be used in the
analysis. The number of illegitimate children was rather high during that time. It
is an interesting fact that the frequency of
anencephalus did not increase in Hamburg
during the war (Lenz, 1965); in Japan
an actual decrease of all CM’s was noted
during World War II (Mitami, 1954).
There are several other examples of this
phenomenon: Leck and Millar (1963) ina
longterm observation noted an increase in
the frequency of hypospadias, cleft palate,

and reducing deformities of the radius
and thumb in the period from July, 1957
to March, 1959, They did not discover the
cause. Knox (1959) and Kucera (1965)
documented a deviation in the frequency
of oesophageal atresia of very short duration. However, they could not determine
the cause of these atresias. Mellin and
Katzenstein (1964) published a deviation
in the frequency of spina bifida when in a
period from 1946 to 1962 15 infants with
spina bifida amongst 15,333 newborns
were born, three of these cases in February,
1962.

Other examples could be cited, for example, clustering of chromosomal aberrations (Frgdland, 1967; Mikamo, 1968;
Pantelakis et al., 1970; Robinson et al.,
1969; and Robinson and Puck, 1965), and
even of leukemia (Day, 1966).

The above patterns of the time-limited
deviations illustrate the characteristic
types of movements for which we most
often have no etiologic explanation. The
movement lasts from several months to sev
Congenital Malformations 425

eral years and is commonly called “clustering,” “short-term change,” or “accumulation.” It apparently lasts as long as the
effects of the “toxins” on the organogenetic
period. We presume that in the majority
of cases, if not always, the teratogen was
brought into the environment, for example,
microbes or factors of civilization.

SEASONAL MOVEMENTS AND
CYCLIC CHANGES

These are deviations of varying duration
which are periodically repeated, for example, every year. The survey of Bailar
and Gurian (1965) reveals that yearly
cycles may be most often observed in
anencephalus, in some malformations of
the heart, and in hip joint dislocation.

An example from Czechoslovakia (see
Figure 1) demonstrates the situation in
five maternity hospitals situated at a distance of some hundred kilometers from
each other, from the period 1957 to 1965.
There is continuous increase in the frequency of CM in the three hospitals

recorded until 1959, then a decrease
followed (Getlik, 1963; Kluka, 1966,
personal communication; SrSem and Fric,
1964, personal communication; Novotna,
1968, personal communication; Znellerova
et al., 1963). The continuing later records
from the fourth and fifth hospitals again
show correspondences in the rise and fall
of CM frequency.

Stoller and Collmann (1965) published
an example of several years of cyclic
changes of Down’s syndrome. The frequency of this syndrome increased in the
years 1942-64 three times in the Province
of Victoria, always at intervals of 5 to 7
years. Infectious hepatitis was suggested
to be closely related to these changes.

This type of movement is not very uniform since the provoking causes are not of
the same nature and, in addition, are
acting in different time periods (e.g., before conception, at conception and during
embryogenesis). Insufficient knowledge of
cyclic movements is due to inadequate
methods of observation and computation.

CONCLUSIONS ON MOVEMENTS IN TIME
IN FREQUENCIES OF CONGENITAL
MALFORMATIONS

Causes of the origin of CM do not always show an even and regular activity
and may strongly affect the frequency of
some CM. The following factors may be
concerned and thus taken in consideration
when analysis of materials collected is
performed:

1. Demographic factors
a. changes in the age structure of women
bearing children
b. changes in number of children in
families
c. immigration of new ethnic groups
d. other factors, e.g., density of inhabitants per square mile, prevailing
type of economic activity of inhabitants, etc.
2. A strong mutagen in the environment
(e.g., radiation, chemicals)

Kuéera

Social Biology

3. A strong teratogen in the environment
(e.g., rubella virus)

4. Unknown effects of the environment,
both biologic and nonbiologic (viruses
and other microérganisms, poisons of
civilization, and others).

The mentioned agents are not overlooked
if they operate epidemically. However, it
is more difficult to prove them if they act
endemically or sporadically. All factors
(whether recognized or not) influence the
frequency of the individual types of CM.
In the majority of cases they are apparently exogenous factors brought into
the environment and superimposed upon
genetic ones which in number and vertical
propagation are relatively constant.

MOVEMENTS IN SPACE

The movement in frequency of CM in
time is connected with the movement of
frequency in space. Often it is impossible
to separate them. If in spite of this, some
examples of movements in space are presented here, it is because they have some
pecularities which do not exist for movements in time.

SPACE CLUSTERING

This is a massing or accumulation of
CM at a certain place without regard to
time dimensions. The distance between
the single cases of CM from each other
is minimal. Pleydell (1960) quotes examples from Northamptonshire where he discovered some clusters of anencephalus and
of heart anomalies both in limited rural
areas and in towns—in the latter, even on
particular streets. A possible time-space
clustering of conjoined twins (with seasonal effect on incidence) was published
by Milham (1966).

BREAK IN FREQUENCY

This is a relatively rapid, locally limited
change in frequency. The addition of iodine to salt in the Apenzell Canton (Swit

zerland), brought about a permanent drop
in the frequency of CM and other disorders of fetal development.

HOMOGENEITY OF FREQUENCY OF CM

Inside large regional complexes there
are differences between the smaller regional units in the frequency of CM. li
the lowest and highest frequencies are
fairly close to each other, we call it high
homogeneity. On the contrary, if there is
a considerable difference between the highest and lowest frequency, we call it low
homogeneity (Kucera & PeleSkova, 1964).
Figure 2 shows low, middle, and high
homogeneity for CM in three regions of
Czechoslovakia. At first we explained this
phenomenon as representing errors of too
small numbers, but we encountered it repeatedly. So far we do not know whether
it will last or disappear. We presume preliminarily that high homogeneity is in

dicative of a population isolate; middle
homogeneity is a characteristic sign for
balanced populations (panmixia) living in
standard environments; low homogeneity
rather indicates an irregular scattering of
teratogens and is probably also proof of
biologically atypical populations. It should
be stressed that comparable samples in
terms of numbers are necessary for analyzing homogeneity.

The movements in frequencies of CM
in space therefore may be induced by imposed causes as well as be fixed by the
place. Very often it was originally a movement in time, which was arrested at new
values. In this way the local geographic
difference occurs.

DISCUSSION
Classification of movements in frequencies of CM according to exogenous
phenomena shows that we are able to

differentiate already some _ peculiarities
which were hitherto merged in one. The
classification is not a final one; further
observations are needed.

Let us consider the mentioned deviation
in the frequency of hypospadias, palatoschisis, and reducing deformities of the
radius (Leck and Millar, 1963). Does it
mean that these CM are controlled by the
same gene loci and that just this particular
genetic material was selectively damaged?
In this connection it is of interest to scan
the material gained by analysis of 1,059
siblings of 936 probands with hypospadias
born between Jan. 1, 1961 and Dec. 31,
1964 in Czechoslovakia (Table 4). The
differences in frequencies of the mentioned
CM are conspicuous (but not statistically
significant) and might indicate that the

Kuéera

Social Biology

findings in Birmingham (1957-61) and in
Czechoslovakia (1961-64), obtained in
different ways, reflect a stable mechanism
of the polygenic multifactorial system.

More analogous cases probably exist,
but they will not come to our attention
until there is continuous reporting of CM.
Studies of CM should be based on adequate
material with completeness of reporting
of CM and objectivity of documentation
for single CM cases. The screening of CM
should last for an adequate period so that
it can intercept a sufficiently numerous
sample ‘of population. The minimal time
should be four to five years and the
minimal number of births, forty to fifty
thousand.

The interpretation of the material implies a knowledge of basic demographic

and population genetics data, standardization of birth data (according to dates

analysis. Finally, a problem still exists:
What present statistical methods or their
combinations are sensitive enough for distinguishing between a chance and a real
change caused by objective factors?

CONCLUSIONS

The study presents a scheme for types
of movements in frequencies of congenital
malformations and presents several examples. Proved or hypothetical causes for
these movements are noted. An attempt
is made to prove that changes in frequen

cies of CM reflect changes in the structure and strength of teratogens and/or
mutagens which affect the human embryo
and/or the gamete before and/or at conception.

Precise and complete screening can provide indirect evidence of the etiological
complexes and of single causes for CM.
This strenuous but fruitful work should
bring further progress in delineating more
accurately all types of movements in frequencies of CM and hence in identifying
further teratogens and/or mutagens. Epidemiologic studies, in particular, should
prove helpful in the solution of these
problems. One basic requirement is the
collection of information for a comparison of the abnormal with the normal.
