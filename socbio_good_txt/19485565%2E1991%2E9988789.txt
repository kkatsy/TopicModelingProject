Can Women Remember How Many

Children They Have Borne?
Data from the East Caribbean

Ann W. Brittain

Department of Anthropology

ABSTRACT: The number of births reported by 786 women of native ancestry on the 1954 census
of St. Barthélémy, French West Indies, was compared to the number of births registered to these
same women in the records of vital events. The magnitude of the difference between the two
numbers was related to a woman’s parity and marital status, but not to her age or literacy. In
general, the agreement between the two numbers was very high, with the mean of reported
parities within 5 per cent of the mean of registered births for all age groups except one, where
the difference was 5.6 per cent. The women of St. Barthélémy were well able to remember the
number of children they had borne. It appears likely that the discrepancies between reported
parities and registered statistics in previous studies are the result of cultural misunderstandings
in questionnaires, or perhaps sample decay, rather than of women’s memory loss.

Much of what we know of human
behavior is ultimately derived from
data gathered through informant interviews. For obvious ethical reasons, all
but the most benign types of experiments on human subjects are impossible, and the events of a human lifetime
unfold far too slowly for direct observation of life-stage changes to be practical in any but a handful of wellfunded projects. Anthropologists have
traditionally relied on participant observation for data collection, but field
work is often expensive, funding difficult to obtain, and research time limited. A year, or even several years, of
residence in a study population may be
inadequate to observe all relevant aspects of cultural behavior directly.
Even anthropologists rely to a large degree on recall and report data.

Unfortunately, the accuracy of data
obtained from informant interviews is
not always easy to assess. Some threats
to data, such as reactivity and the ex
pectations of both subject and researcher, have been well documented
(Bernard et al., 1984), but accuracy
has been a difficult problem to approach, at least partially because independent sources of data verification
seldom exist. Many researchers mention the problem of informant accuracy
in the opening paragraphs of their
work and may indicate probable directions of bias and the effect that such
bias may have on the results of a study.
But even if the possibility of bias has
been mentioned, it is seldom possible
to do anything about it, and data are
often used as if they were true (Freeman et al., 1987), perhaps because
even faulty data are seen as being better than no data at all. But if data are
to be used in major policy decisions,
inaccuracy can lead to costly mistakes.
The accuracy of data is a real problem
of potentially major proportions.

The magnitude of the problem can
be seen in the results of those studies

that have been successful in measuring
discrepancies between reality and informant reports. In a review of these
studies, Bernard et al. (1984) concluded that approximately half of what
informants tell researchers is wrong;
studies in child development showed
that the inaccuracy level of mothers
was one-third to three-quarters when
they were asked to recall their children’s scholastic abilities and health

status; 59 per cent of chronic medical ©

conditions went unreported in one
study; people could not recall about
half of their telecommunications with
others over a three-week period in another, and so on. In a more recent
study of attendance at one of a series of
meetings, informants were found to
have reported the presence of people
who were not there and to have omitted the presence of people who had attended, with 141 errors made out of
272 reporting opportunities, a rate of
52 per cent (Freeman et al., 1987).
Evidently, a major source of informant error is the tendency to report
general rather than specific events.
Cultural expectations or norms may be
elicited in response to questions,
whether in a conscious attempt by subjects to appear to have followed cultural prescriptions, as in reporting intervals between marriages and first
births, or whether as a result of the tendency for people with well-developed
mental structures to perceive things as
they ought to be, and not necessarily as
they are (see Bernard et al., 1984;
Freeman et al., 1987; Rindfuss and
Morgan, 1983). The tendency to perceive norms and not reality is, of
course, shared by supposedly objective
scientists and is not restricted to the re
Social Biology

porting of recall data by informants. It
is probably responsible for the observed tendency for women over the
age of thirty-five to be subjected to
high rates of Caesarean section despite
the absence of objective differences in
indications for operative delivery (see
Grimes and Gross, 1981, and Kirz et
al., 1985), and has been the subject of
recent discussions concerning the interaction between anthropologists and
their data (see Kirschner, 1987;
Mascia-Lees et al., 1989). It is important to note that for the most part the
discrepancy between informant reports
and reality is not the fault of the informants, who, except in rare instances of
intentional deception, are accurately
reporting their perceptions. Some researchers have emphasized the importance of phrasing questions and conducting interviews in such a way as to
minimize errors (Bateson, 1979; Potter, 1977), although in the absence of
independent sources of data, it may be
difficult to know when this goal has
been achieved. And Blacker and Brass
(1979) remind us that errors may be
substantial even with careful questioning. Discrepancies between perceptions and reality are also, for the most
part, not a problem to the informants
themselves, as most people seem to get
along quite well using their schematic
constructs of reality (Bernard et al.,
1984).

One area in which differences between informant reports and reality
may be of some importance is in the
area of demographic research. Often
interviews are the only source of data
at the family and local levels for estimating period and cohort fertility
rates, especially when vital registration

Vol. 38, No. 3-4

is incomplete (Blacker and Brass,
1979; Potter, 1977). These interview
data may be the basis for major population policy decisions, affecting expensive programs. Again, those studies that have been done of comparisons
between informant reports and reality
in demographic matters are not encouraging. In a study of the French
population of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin
Islands, Morrill and Dyke (1980) found
that 25 per cent of the people listed in
records of the population were forgotten in informant interviews despite
considerable efforts to make a complete enumeration. Increasing collateral distance from the informants made
omission more likely, so that those
who left few or no descendants in the
population were most likely to be omitted. The authors of the study concluded that the failure to remember
past population members will inflate
population growth rate estimates
whenever informants are used to construct genealogies. Adams and Kasakoff (1980) calculated a similar rate of
10 to 30 per cent loss of persons from
genealogies. The implication, of
course, is that populations without
written records, the so-called ‘‘preliterate” groups, may not be increasing
as rapidly as supposed.

On the other hand, when birth histories are the focus of inquiry, fertility
rates may appear to be declining when
in fact they are not, or to be declining
more rapidly than they really are. Potter (1977) showed in a series of computer simulations that a few logical assumptions concerning informant errors
in omitted births and event misplacement could produce a commonly reported pattern of change in cohort

fertility schedules, with fertility declines concentrated in the oldest reproductive age groups. Other possible
sources of error in demographic data
which may be of concern include faisifying the intervals between marriage
and first birth, as has already been
mentioned, and a failure to report the
births of children who later died, either
because these children were female,
because they were not considered real
people until they had reached a certain
age, because of a taboo on speaking
of the dead, or because the deaths
of some children were less than accidental.

Some researchers have been able to
devise independent checks on informant accuracy to assess the frequency
and types of errors most likely to be
made, but it is rare for those involved
in fertility studies in developing countries to have access to independent
sources of data. Checks for internal
consistency, guesses as to possible
sources and direction of bias in the
data, and estimates of probable error
magnitude are all possible, but may remain little more than speculation in
most cases. The present study compares the answers to a fertility question
on the French national census of 1954
asked of 786 women of native ancestry
on the island of St. Barthélémy,
French West Indies with the same information derived from records of vital
events that were made as the births
happened. Because the vital records
for this population are extremely accurate, it has been possible to estimate
the magnitude of reporting errors quite
closely and to identify some of the demographic characteristics of those
women who were most likely to report

a different number of children on the
census than were recorded in the birth
registers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

St. Barthélémy (St. Bart) is a dry island of approximately twenty-five
square kilometers located in the
French West Indies. St. Martin is the
closest inhabited island, and Saba and
Statia can be seen on clear days. St.
Bart’s first permanent settlement occurred in 1659 when the French sent a
company of thirty colonists from St.
Kitts to protect St. Bart’s harbor from
the British. St. Bart is too rugged and
dry for plantation agriculture, and the
only sugar mill built on the island failed
immediately (Bourdin, 1978). But the
harbor is excellent, and St. Bart is located near the Anegada Passage, one
of the few places that large sailing vessels could beat their way between islands out of the Caribbean Sea. Its
strategic importance was great, and it
was frequently the object of hostile attention and attack by the major European powers as they fought for ascendancy in the Caribbean, and was
always a haven for pirates (Bourdin,
1978; Lasserre, 1961).

St. Bart’s most prosperous period
before the present started in 1758 when
the French government ceded the island to Sweden in return for trading
privileges in Gothenberg. As a neutral
port, St. Bart rapidly became the center of regional trade, with its capital
city growing from a small village of
huts and mud paths to a well-planned
city of five thousand in just a few years
(Bourdin, 1978; Lasserre, 1961). The
prosperity was short-lived, however,

Social Biology

and in 1814 when the Treaty of Paris
established peace between the European nations, trade was lost to St.
Thomas, Virgin Islands, on the other
side of the Anegada Passage, whose
superior deep-water harbor could accommodate more and larger vessels
(Bourdin, 1978). By 1840 the total
population of St. Bart had declined by
two-thirds, and in 1878 Sweden returned St. Bart to France.

Despite the rise and fall of the fortunes of St. Bart’s commercial center,
life in the countryside changed very little over hundreds of years. The people
of St. Bart traditionally made their living with a brush fallow system of slash
and burn farming on small holdings,
raising maize, pigeon peas, millet or
Guinea corn, and different kinds of
roots, such as igname, malanga, and
manioc. In the rainy season herbs and
vegetables such as squash, melon, peppers, tomatoes, and okra were also
grown. A few goats and chickens were
raised, and the men did some fishing.
At various times the sale of small
amounts of salt, indigo, cotton, and tobacco have provided some cash income
(Bourdin, 1978; Lasserre, 1961). This
way of life persists even today, although the tourist boom which began
in the late 1970’s opened new jobs in
construction, commerce, and hotel service and created an alternative lifestyle
that many of the younger St. Barts
have embraced. In 1954, when the census data used in this study were collected, St. Bart’s population shared in
the general poverty of the Caribbean

(Lasserre, 1961), although life expect
ancies at birth had increased to 56.7
years for males and 67.6 years for females (Brittain, 1990). Over half of the

adult population was either illiterate,
or able to read and write only a few
words (Lasserre, 1961).

Since St. Bart was returned to
France in 1878, the French government
has kept records of the births, deaths,
and marriages that have taken place on
the island. The recording of these
events is very important for French citizens, and the rate of compliance has
been extremely high. The records of vital events from 1878 to the present
have been photographed, and the
records to 1976 have been computerized. The various records for each individual have been combined, and
families and sibships have been assembled, creating genealogies with a depth
of several generations. The earlier
records have been checked for accuracy against church records, and the
more recent records have been compared to the listes nominatives sections
of government censuses taken in 1954,
1961, and 1967, and checked in field
studies in 1972, 1973, and 1975-76,
with the result that they are a highly
accurate representation of the experience of the island’s population (see
Brittain et al., 1988). Altogether, approximately 10,000 individuals appear
in the records of vital events.

In 1954 the French government conducted a population census of St. Barthélémy. There were 2,017 people living on the island, of whom 1,812 were
of native St. Bart ancestry. Of the people of St. Bart ancestry, 786 were females aged 15 and older who had been
born since the French began keeping
records in 1878. For each of the women
a single question reported how many
children had been born alive. To a
large extent the single-question life

history fertility question has been replaced by a series of questions concerning children still living with the mother, .
children living elsewhere and children
who had died, the major motive for the
change being concerns about the accuracy of the data obtained (Blacker and ©
Brass, 1979). In this study, the number
of children reported in the census was
compared to the number of live births
listed in the records of vital events for
each of the 786 women. There were |
1,550 children reported in the census
and 1,574 live births listed in the.
records of vital events.
Among the variables commonly
considered as probable causes of errors
in reported fertility are the age of the
woman, her marital status, literacy,
and parity. The age of each woman at
the time of the census was included in
this study as an independent variable
that might affect reporting accuracy on
the theory that older women would be
more likely to have forgotten some of
the children they had borne, particularly if some of those children had died
early in life. Blacker and Brass (1979)
suggest that older women may be more
likely to misunderstand questions or to
have memory lapses than are younger
women, and Potter (1977) and Bernard
et al. (1984) suggest that reporting errors are more common the longer the
time that has elapsed since an event. It
is, of course, possible that older
women might have exaggerated the
number of children they had borne for
dramatic effect, but it is hypothesized
here that age would be positively correlated with the number of omissions
made in the reporting of births. The
ages used in the analysis were the ages
calculated from the records of the

women’s births to avoid any bias that
might be introduced in using selfreported ages.

Marital status was included as an independent variable in this study because it has been suggested that illegitimate children are more likely to be
omitted from birth histories than are
other children (Potter, 1977). It may
be, therefore, that unmarried women
would be more likely than married
women to have discrepancies in the
number of live births reported on the
census and the number registered in
the records of vital events. Literacy
was included as a variable because
some researchers have been concerned
that educational level may affect the
quality of reported data, whether the
predicted biases affect the conclusions
of the study or not (Blacker and Brass,
1979; Das Gupta, 1987). It was hypothesized here that literate women would
show greater accuracy in reporting
births than would illiterate women. Finally, parity was included as an independent variable on the theory that intervening events might be as important
as elapsed time in modifying recall of
the past. Perhaps those women who
had had the most births would be most
likely to have hazier recollections of
earlier births and therefore to make
more reporting errors.

Age, marital status, literacy, and
parity were considered in SPSS-X stepwise regression procedures (see Norusis, 1983) as independent variables that
might explain any differences in the

reported on the census and the number
registered to her in the records of vital
events. Variables of potential importance in distorting the results of fertility studies that are not addressed here

are the accuracy of women in reporting
their own ages, sample decay, or the
possible relationship between parity
and maternal survival to the time of the
census, and event misplacement,
which is impossible to address on the
basis of the single-question fertility his
tory.

RESULTS

Of the 786 women of native ancestry
aged fifteen and older born after the
French began keeping records in 1878
and living on St. Bart in 1954, 397 were
married or widowed, and 389 had
never been married. The mean number
of children registered in the records of
vital events was 2.00 per woman, with
a standard deviation of 2.81, and a
range from zero to seventeen live
births. The self-reported literacy rate
was 60.6 per cent for these women,
with older women less likely to be literate than younger women (r=
—0.561, F(1,784) = 360.90, p < 0.01).
Fifty-four of the 786 women, 6.9 per
cent, had discrepancies between the
number of births reported on the census and the number registered in the
records of vital events. Thirty-seven
women reported from one to four
fewer live births than were registered,
and seventeen women reported from
one to five births more. The average
difference in reported and recorded
live births was 0.031 births per woman.
The main effects of the independent
variables were as follows (Table 1):

Marital status. —It was hypothesized
that there would have been a tendency
for illegitimate births to go unreported
more often than legitimate births, and
that unmarried women would therefore have been more likely than married women to have made errors in reporting the number of live births that
they had had. Contrary to expectation,
fewer unmarried women (seven of 389,
or 1.80 per cent) made reporting errors
than did married women (47 of 397, or
11.84 per cent, y7(1) with Yates correction = 29.42, p<0.01), perhaps
because very few unmarried women
had children to report. Only 3.9 per
cent of the registered births to the
women of native St. Bart ancestry who
were resident on the island in 1954
were to unmarried mothers, as the difficult life and small size of the plots on
which the people make their living

226

make supporting illegitimate children
very difficult for a woman and her family, and reinforce the religious and
moral proscriptions that place strong
emphasis on childbearing only in the
context of marriage. The relationship
between the difference in the number
of a woman’s reported and registered
births and her marital status did not,
however, reach statistical significance
(r = 0.040, F(1,784) = 1.26, n.s.).

The errors made by unmarried
women were not solely errors of omission: 28.57 per cent of unmarried
women and 31.91 per cent of married
women who made reporting errors reported more births on the census than
were registered in the records of vital
events. In one case it was obvious that
an older sister who had remained unmarried and who had helped to raise
her siblings had reported on the census
the number of children her deceased
mother had borne. Other unmarried
women may have made similar errors
in reporting as their own children siblings, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews that they had raised. Married
women might also have included children fathered by their husbands outside of the marriage if they were responsible for their welfare.

Literacy. —It was hypothesized that
illiterate women might be less likely to
have developed the mental constructs
necessary to quantify events rather
than simply experience them and
would therefore be more inclined to
make errors in reporting the number of
live births they had had. As has been
mentioned, literacy in this population,
as in many others, was negatively related to age, with younger women being more likely than older women to be
able to read and write at least a few

Brittain

Social Biology

words. Literate women were less likely
to be married than were illiterate
women (r=—0.184, F(1,784) =
27.47, p<0.01) and had fewer children than illiterate women (r =
—0.248, F(1,784) = 51.38, p<0.01),
but there was no relationship between
literacy and the difference in the number of births a woman reported and the
number registered in the records of vital events (r =—0.003, F(1,784) =
0.01, n.s.).

Parity.—It was hypothesized that
women who had given birth to only a
few children might be expected to remember each event more distinctly
than would women who had had many
children and therefore to make fewer
reporting errors. If informants with
more experience in certain areas have
better developed mental structures
than others, and are therefore more
likely to recall general rather than specific events as Freeman et al. (1987)
suggest, it may be that women with
many births might be more likely to
make errors in reporting the number of
live births they had had. Indeed, there
was a Statistically significant relationship in this population between the
number of live births a woman had
had, as registered in the records of vital
events, and the number of births omitted in the census (r= 0.177,
F(1,784) = 25.36, p<0.01). Interestingly, those women who had had the
greatest number of stillbirths were
somewhat less likely than others to underreport live births on the census
(r = —0.243, F(1,784) = 49.20, p<
0.01). Perhaps they were more likely to
remember each child as having lived
for at least a short time, if that was the
norm of their experience.

Multiple correlations.—When age,

Vol. 38, No. 3-4

marital status, literacy, and parity, as
measured by the number of live births
registered in the records of vital
events, were considered together, both
parity and marital status contributed
significantly to the variation in the difference between the number of live
births a woman reported on the census
and the number of live births registered to her in the records of vital
events (R = 0.202, F(2,783) = 16.68,
p<0.01). Specifically, women with
more live births were more likely to
make omissions on the census than
were other women, and when the number of births was controlled, married
women were less likely to omit reporting births than were unmarried
women. The observed tendency for unmarried women to make fewer omissions in reporting births was indeed because they had fewer births to report.
Despite the statistical significance of
the relationships, however, only 4.09
per cent of the variation in reporting
errors was explained.

As has already been mentioned, the
number of stillbirths a woman had had
was significantly related to the number
of omissions in the reporting of live
births (r = —0.243, F(1,784) = 49.20,
p<0.01), with women who had the
greatest number of stillbirths being either less likely to omit mentioning
some live births, or perhaps to include
at least some of the stillbirths in their
reports of live births than were other
women. When the number of stillbirths
was included as a fifth explanatory
variable in the multivariate analysis, it
joined the number of live births and
marital status as being significantly related to the variation in the difference
in the number of live births reported
and registered (R = 0.332, F(3,782) =

227

32.38, p< 0.01). With the number of
stillbirths included in the analysis,
11.05 per cent of the variation in the
difference between reported and registered live births was explained.

DISCUSSION

Unfortunately, despite the possibility of identifying some of the demographic factors that led to misreporting
the number of live births on the 1954
census, it was impossible to use this information to produce a useful estimate
of the magnitude of the reporting errors likely to be made by women based
on the information available on the
census. Although the difference in the
number of live births reported on the
census and registered in the records of
vital events was Significantly related to
the number of live births registered in
the records of vital events (r = 0.177,
F(1,784) = 25.36, p < 0.01), it was not
significantly related to the number of
live births reported on the census
(r = 0.023, F(1,784) = 0.415, n-s.).
When the number of live births reported on the census was substituted
for parity as derived from the records
of vital events in the multivariate ana)ysis, marital status was also not a significant factor in predicting reporting
errors. The information available from
the census alone cannot be used to predict errors in reported fertility.

Fortunately, however, predicting
the difference between the number of
live births a woman reported on the
census and the number registered in
the records of vital events probably
would not be necessary for this population. Despite the fact that 6.9 per
cent of all women, including 11.8 per
cent of married women, did not report

228

the same number of live births as were
registered, the overall accuracy of the
fertility data derived from the census
was excellent. The mean number of
live births registered in the records of
vital events was 2.00 per woman, with
a standard deviation of 2.81, while the
mean number of live births reported in
the census was 1.97 per woman with a
standard deviation of 2.77. For all
women, the average difference in reported and registered live births was
0.03 births per woman, approximately
1.52 per cent of the mean parity. For
married women it was 1.26 per cent of
the mean parity of 3.81 live births per
woman, and for unmarried women it
was 8.06 per cent of the mean parity of
0.16 live births per woman.

The correlation between the number of live births each woman reported
on the census and the number registered to her name in the records of vital
events was very high (r= 0.988,
F(1,784) = 32,229.53, p<0.01), with
the number of live births registered in
the records explaining 97.26 per cent of
the variation in the number reported in
the census. Given the number of live
births a woman reported on the census,
it is possible to predict the actual number of live births she had had with a
high degree of confidence using Equation 1.

LBIR = 1.004 NCEN + 0.023 (1)

Where:

LBIR = the number of live births a
woman had registered in the
records of vital events, and

NCEN = the number of live births re
ported on the census.

As the maximum number of live
births for a woman in this population

Brittain

Social Biology

was seventeen, the best strategy for determining the actual number of live
births a woman had had, given her response to the fertility question on the
census, would simply be to take her
word for it.

Table 2 shows the distribution of
parities by age group. Table 3 shows
the kinds of reporting errors made, and
Table 4 compares the mean number of
births registered and reported. Despite
the fact that in five out of twelve age
categories the number of females with
reporting errors exceeded 5 per cent,
the magnitude of the errors made was
small enough that only the 25-29 age
group showed a difference in reported
and registered parities of greater than 5
per cent, and that was 5.63 per cent.
The agreement between the number of
live births reported on the census and
registered in the records of vital events
is very high. The average parities obtained for the various age groups could
be used with confidence for almost any

purpose, and although the significant
relationships between age and the
probability of reporting errors, and between parity and marital status and the
probability of reporting errors, might
create difficulties in relating other demographic variables to fertility, these
difficulties could be largely overcome
by confining analysis to women of
childbearing age. Of the 458 women
aged 15-44 only 3.06 per cent made
any kind of reporting error, while
10.06 percent of the 328 women aged
45 and older made errors. If it is true
that rephrasing questions and adding
more specific inquiries about children
who died increases the accuracy of fertility reporting,the women in this population would be able to produce fertility reports that would be very

accurate indeed.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The difference between the number
of live births reported on the 1954 census of St. Barthélémy by women of native ancestry aged fifteen and older and
the number of live births recorded for
these women in the records of vital
events was calculated. SPSS-X regression analysis was used to determine the
effects of the woman’s age, her marital
status, whether or not she was literate,
and the number of live children she had
borne, as registered in the records of
vital events, on the size of the difference between these two numbers. The
difference between reported and registered births was significantly related
to the total number of live children the
woman had borne, and to her marital
status. Age and literacy had no apparent effect. Women with more live
births were more likely to make omis

sions on the census, as were unmarried
women when the other variables were
controlled. Together these two variables accounted for 4.09 per cent of the
variance in reporting errors. When the
number of stillbirths a woman had experienced was included in the analysis,
11.05 per cent of the variance in reporting errors was explained, with women
who had experienced more stillbirths
being either less likely to omit mentioning some live births, or more likely
to report some stillbirths as live births
than were other women.

Despite the relationship between
the number of live children a woman
had borne, as measured by the number
of births registered to her in the
records of vital events, and the magnitude of the reporting error made on the
census, the number of births reported
on the census was not related to the
magnitude of the reporting error. It
was impossible to predict the magnitude of the error a woman was likely to
make in reporting the number of live
children she had borne on the basis of
data available from the census alone.
Fortunately, this does not present a
major problem. The average number
of live births reported on the census
differed from the average number registered in the records of vital events by
only 1.52 per cent of the average parity
of 2.00 live births per woman. Only the
25—29 year age group had an average
reported parity that differed by more
than 5 per cent from the true average,
and that difference was 5.6 per cent.

Of the total of 786 women of native
ancestry aged fifteen and older only 47,
5.68 per cent, made reporting errors of
any kind. For the 458 women aged
15-44 only 14, 3.06 per cent, made any
reporting errors. The best predictor of
the number of live children a woman

had actually borne was simply the
number she reported on the census.
Women in this population were well
able to remember the number of children they had borne and reported this
number with a high degree of accuracy
in response to a single question fertility
survey on the 1954 census. If multiplequestion surveys do indeed -produce
better results than single-question
ones, the accuracy of the data these
women would be able to provide would
be remarkable.

Given the results of this study, it
may be surprising that the conclusions
to be drawn are not entirely optimistic.
The fact that women remember how
many children they have borne is encouraging, but does not necessarily
mean that they will tell researchers
what they need to know. Blacker and
Brass (1979) list some of the problems
encountered in previous studies, including discrepancies in data taken
from registers and censuses, and from
pregnancy histories and general questions concerning the number of births.
The data presented here suggest that
memory lapses are not necessarily the
cause of these problems, but do not
deny the existence of problems. Instead, they suggest that language differences, cultural definitions of ‘“‘children” or “offspring,” taboos on
speaking of the dead, or deliberate
concealment of infanticide or falsification of birth dates, none of which were
apparently encountered on a large
scale in the French census of St. Barthélémy, may be more important
sources of error. These problems may
or may not be more amenable to correction than simple forgetfulness.

The data presented here also suggest that other possible sources of bias
in fertility surveys need to be investi

231

gated more thoroughly. When the infant mortality rates calculated from
survey data are lower than those expected on the basis of national statistics, as is frequently the case, the difficulty may not be in the accuracy of
the survey. Even if all women recall
and report their fertility histories with
complete precision, other sources of
potential bias, including the differential migration and differential mortality of adult women of different parities
may exist. Potter (1977) has expressed
the opinion that in a population closed
to migration the bias introduced by the
selective mortality of women by parity
is “probably negligible when the expectation of life at birth exceeds 50
years and attention is restricted to the
ten years preceding the survey” (p.
341), but in the absence of supporting
data this must be seen as a hope, rather
than a fact. Data presented by Philippe
and Yelle (1976) certainly suggest that
mortality among females over the age
of fifty is not random with respect to
parity, a potential problem when older
women are surveyed to determine secular fertility trends.

Women from the island of St. Barthélémy, French West Indies are apparently well aware of the number of
children they have borne. Numerous
studies have suggested that the data
obtained from fertility surveys is suspect, and this study, unfortunately,
does not contradict this. Instead, it indicates that errors are unlikely to be
due to the faulty memories of the
women questioned. Potential sources
of bias may be more likely to be found
in cultural differences in the definition
of the subject under discussion or in
the nonrandom component of adult female mortality.
