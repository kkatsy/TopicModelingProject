Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
as a Socially Determined Cause of Death

ABSTRACT: The background characteristics of infant deaths which have been certified by
physicians as due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) are examined. Two alternative
models for explaining SIDS deaths are considered. The first views SIDS solely in
medical/biological terms, while the second emphasizes the role played by social and cultural
factors, either as contributing conditions or as factors in the misattribution of SIDS as the cause
of death where other conditions are actually present. Data are based on linked birth and death
certificates for the 1980~82 cohort of live births in Florida, which have been merged with NCHS
reports of multiple cause of death. Analysis suggests a pattern of SIDS reporting which varies
inversely with maternal education, prenatal care, and race/ethnicity. This pattern suggests
either that social factors affect the etiology of the syndrome to a greater degree than would be
expected from the medical/bialogical model or that deaths to infants of lower socioeconomic

status are attributed to SIDS more often than warranted.

Despite a continuing decline in the
rate of infant mortality in the United
States, the number and rate of infant
deaths are regarded by everyone as still
unacceptably high. In an effort to identify components of the infant mortality
rate that can be reduced significantly
through policy interventions, various
medical, epidemiological, and demographic researchers have focused their
attention on trends in particular medical

causes of infant deaths as well as on

characteristics of infants and their mothers that are associated with infant mortality.

One intriguing finding has been that
the cause of death known as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (or SIDS) has not
been declining and, in fact, has been increasing in many populations.

In highly-advanced countries, SIDS
is now the most common single cause of

 

death after the perinatal period and often is more common than all other
causes of death combined at the age of
three months (Knight, 1983, p. 20). It
ranks second only to injuries as the most
frequent cause of death in children less
than 15 years of age. Between 6,000 and
7,000 babies a year fall victim to this
cause of death in the United States

. (Bergman, 1986, xi).

What is especially disturbing about
SIDS, sometimes called cot death or
crib death, is that it is an unspecific cause
of death. SIDS deaths have been
defined as “the sudden death of any infant or young child which is unexpected
by history and in which a thorough postmortem fails to demonstrate an adequate cause for the death” (J. Bruce
Beckwith, cited in Knight, 1983, p. 16).

Although SIDS retains an aura of
mystery in media reports, and hence in

the public mind, a great deal of information has been compiled through various
studies which provide some clues as to
the nature of SIDS cases and possible
general explanations of them. One
theme that runs through many of these
studies is the presence of certain medical
conditions, one set of which has substantial support as an associated set of physiological factors. A second theme relates
to identifiable differences in personal
and environmental characteristics of
SIDS cases and other causes of infant
deaths.

In this paper, we briefly review the
existing literature covering these two
themes, and then examine the characteristics of SIDS cases in Florida based
on an ongoing study of infant mortality
in the state. We conclude with reflections on the alternative explanations for
SIDS, considering not only medical and
environmental factors but also the nature of reporting practices of infant
deaths by physicians.

REVIEW OF STUDIES

Knight (1983, p. 66) reported the existence of well over 2,000 references in
medical journals on the subject of SIDS.
The vast majority of these advance hypotheses about physiological factors
that one or more researchers have
shown to have an empirical connection
to SIDS. Included among these factors
are allergy to cow’s milk, virus infection,
magnesium deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, selenium deficiency, spinal
hemorrhage, hypothermia (or low body
temperature), carbon dioxide pooling,
heart conduction defects, house mite allergy, bacterial infection, botulism,
errors of metabolism, failure of the immune system, sodium overload, and hypernatremia (Knight, 1983, p. 74-88;
Valdes-Dapena, 1980).

 

Social Biology

None of these explanations have remained uncontested. Contradictory
findings have been reported for many of
these factors, and arguments for these
factors as single-cause explanations are
unsubstantial. It is more likely that they
can be contributory factors in a range of
cases.

A more persistent phystological explanation of SIDS, discovered in a large
number of investigations, incorporates
the following sequence of events: Certain infants have a tendency to prolonged sleep apnoea, or absence of
breathing, for more than 15 seconds.
There is a tendency for hypoxia (a deficiency of oxygen) to begin if sleep apnoea is unduly prolonged. At the same
time, carbon dioxide accumulates in the
blood. Once an anoxic state occurs because of apnoea, the anoxia itself prolongs the apnoea and a descending spiral
of respiratory activity begins. Virus infections may act on this apnoea-anoxia
cycle, with the consequence that this can
rapidly lead to sudden failure of the
heart (Knight, 1983, p. 88-93). It has
been suggested that this cycle may occur
outside of sleep, although the sleeping
state will make the baby more vulnerable to the condition (Weinstein et al.,
1983).

Not all episodes of this cycle will lead
to death. The notion of a “near-miss
SIDS” refers to cases where a baby who
has ceased breathing and who seems to
have died suddenly and unexpectedly
has its life saved by timely intervention,
merely by the mother scooping up the
baby in a panic and rushing off to the
nearest neighbor, doctor, or accident
department of the local hospital
(Knight, 1983, 101).

Existing studies have specified the
circumstances and characteristics of
SIDS deaths. A significantly high risk of
SIDS is associated with the season of the

year (winter months), the day of the
week (holidays and weekends, especially Sunday), the time of day (early
morning hours), the prevailing temperature (low night temperatures), the region of the country (varies with coroner’s or physicians’ practices), age of the
infant (1 to 3 months), sex of the infant (male), maternal age (younger
mothers), gestation (prematurity), family size (greater number of siblings), plurality of births (twins), previous birth interval (short), birthweight (low),
marital status of mother (unmarried),
smoking behavior of mother (smoker),
maternal blood pressure (fast drop in
late gestation), previous medical condition (respiratory infection), social class
(lower), and postnatal care (previously
in intensive care center) (Knight, 1983;
MacFarlane, 1982; MacFarlene and
Gardner, 1982; Carpenter and
Gardner, 1982; Adelstein et al., 1982;
Bergman, 1986; Naeye, 1983; Spiers
and Wang, 1976; Peterson et al., 1979;
Babson and Clarke, 1983; Getts, 1981;
Kahn et al., 1986; Riordan and Grindstaff, 1987).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For the past two years, the authors
and colleagues have been engaged in a
large-scale study of infant mortality in
Florida, with support from NICHD.
The data set combines linked birth and
death certificate information for the
1980-82 cohort of 412,876 live births in
Florida with multiple-cause coding of
death records provided by NCHS. Computer work to produce the merged data
was performed by the investigators under an agreement with the Florida Department of Vital Statistics. Further information about the process of creating
the data tapes can be found in
previously-issued reports (Nam et al.,

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 3

1987; Eberstein et al., 1987; and Nam et
al., 1987).

The data file incorporates a wide
range of analytical variables, including
prior or background factors such as race/
ethnicity, maternal education, marital
status, and rural/urban residence; proximate factors such as birthweight, prenatal care, interval since last birth or pregnancy, gestational age, hospital
delivery, maternal age, prior fetal or infant death, plurality, and infant’s sex;
and immediate factors such as age at
death and cause of death.

Since cause of infant death was one of
the principal lines of interest in our
study, we undertook to classify medical
causes in several ways. All of the varia- |
tions were based on the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (World Health Organization,
1977). The four alternative cause-ofdeath classifications we used were the
underlying cause of death, which is derived from the sequence of causes listed
by a physician on the death certificate
and identifies what is presumed to be the
cause of death that triggered the morbid
episode leading to death; total mentions
of causes, in which a cited condition is
counted as a cause regardless of whether
or not it is designated as the underlying
cause; the principal diagnostic cause,
that which is characterized by the typical
priority in a physician’s medical diagnosis; and cause combinations, the configuration of those conditions mentioned on the death certificate.

With regard to SIDS, these distinctions are not highly meaningful because,
in our study, additional conditions were
reported for only a small percentage of
SIDS cases. This absence of other conditions is very unusual in that all other
causes of death were frequently reported in combination with other conditions on the certificate. This fact alone

indicates something distinctive about
the citing of SIDS on the death record.

RESULTS

In Table 1, we compare percentage
of births, all infant deaths, and SIDS
deaths found in higher-risk categories of
fifteen variables. Since the basis for classifying cause of death was not highly relevant, we used the underlying cause
classification.

When compared with births, infant
deaths as a whole are significantly overrepresented for nearly all of the high

risk factors. When compared with all infant deaths, SIDS deaths are

significantly overrepresented for low ed
ucation, unmarried mothers, inadequate prenatal care, male infants, young
age of mother, and short previous birth
interval.

These findings are quite consistent
with the studies that show selective characteristics of mothers and infants involved in SIDS deaths. In an effort to
distinguish risk-factor associations that
are more social and environmental in
nature than physiological, the percent

age of SIDS cases in high-risk categories
are compared in Table 2 with two other
infant cause-of-death categories: congenital anomalies, except heart and circulatory, which relate mainly to physiological conditions (e.g., spina bifida),
and accidents, which relate primarily to
social and environmental factors.

The data reveal the fact that SIDS
cases have infant and maternal characteristics that are far more similar to
deaths from accidents than to deaths

greatest similarity of SIDS and accident

SIDS, congenital malformations, and
accidents are shown in Table 3. This table presents the results of a log-linear
analysis of cause-specific infant mortality on a series of background (education, race/ethnicity) and proximate (maternal age, birthweight, and timing of
prenatal care) mortality determinants.
While not identical, SIDS mortality
seems more similar to accidental deaths
than to deaths from congenital malformations in its relationships to these factors. This is especially true for differentials by education, race/ethnicity, and
maternal age, but is less so for timing of
prenatal care. The pattern of effects by
birthweight varies across these causes of
death, probably reflecting the small

 

Social Biology

number of cases in the lowest
birthweight categories.

The data in Table 3 reaffirm our suggestion made above that social factors
act both as background and as intermediate influences on SIDS mortality. Indeed, these data suggest substantially
higher mortality among those with low
maternal eduction and among blacks (in
contrast to substantially lower SIDS
mortality among Hispanics than among
white non-Hispanics), as well as among
those with young maternal age and late
prenatal care (first visit later than the
first trimester of pregnancy). Although
differences by cause of death are less
pronounced, this conclusion is also consistent with patterns of effects observed

when analysis is restricted to postneonatal deaths (data not shown). We discuss
the implications of these findings in
more detail below.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings support a growing body
of evidence concerning the characteristics of of SIDS deaths. Although SIDS
deaths can be associated with high-risk
physiological conditions, most often a
syndrome that incorporates respiratory
ailments which increase mortal risks
during sleep periods, the selectivity of
social and environmental characteristics
of SIDS infants and their mothers indicate relatively high frequency of social
deprivation and relative neglect.

Not only do SIDS cases load more on
high-risk categories than do all births or
all infant deaths, but they resemble
deaths from accidents more than the
congenital anomalies examined here in
terms of these high-risk category loadings.

Reports of numerous SIDS cases in
which the infant had previously been in
a neonatal intensive care unit but later
released also point to medically viable
babies who did not receive appropriate
infant care.

The picture one can derive from this
information is one of mildly sick infants
who do not receive sufficient attention
at times when such attention is most
needed. On the other hand, despite
overall selectivity on high-risk factors, a
high proportion of SIDS cases do not
have high-risk category associations.
This suggests that no single explanation
will suffice to account for all reported
SIDS deaths.

 

 

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 7

Given the widespread absence of
other morbid conditions on the death
certificate for SIDS cases, it seems reasonable to conclude that perhaps many
physicians assign infant deaths to the
SIDS category when diagnosis is uncertain or in order to mercifully conclude a
medical investigation, especially if the
possibility exists of maternal or familial
neglect of an infant.

SIDS deaths are rapidly losing the
aura of mystery that was attached to
them some years ago. In light of the
findings from this study and many others
that have explored the characteristics of
SIDS cases, it is incumbent upon the
physicians and other persons who diagnose such deaths to be more specific
about associated medical conditions and
about the social and environmental circumstances which surround these cases.

Devices to monitor the respiratory
problems of infants during periods of
sleep or periods when they are awake
but left unattended are now serving to
convert many SIDS deaths into nearmisses. It now remains for both the
medical and social service sectors of our
society to put more emphasis on facilitating the proper care of infants in prenatal as well as postnatal situations so
that mortality crises for infants now being labeled “SIDS” can be further reduced.
