Income and Childlessness in Canada:

A Further Examination

ABSTRACT: The relationship between childlessness and income is investigated using 1971 Canadian census data. The rate of childlessness among rural French Catholics is used to represent the
maximum rate of physiological childlessness. By using various residence and education groups,
hypothesized relationships between income and voluntary and involuntary childlessness are
tested. The findings support the suggestion that income is inversely related to involuntary
childlessness and directly related to voluntary childlessness.

The relationship between childlessness
and various socioeconomic variables is
complex. It has been demonstrated that
the distribution of family size without contraception is nearly a negative binomial
distribution. However, the number of
childless families has consistently been
found to be greater than the expected
number (Waller et al., 1973), which has
led to the suggestion that childlessness
stems from two different causes, one voluntary and the other involuntary.! In
other words, childlessness may be “due
either to the deliberate decision to use
birth control and/or abortion to prevent all
births or to the sterility or subfecundity of

1 Veevers (1972) differentiates three causes of
childlessness: (a) physiological factors including
specific physical abnormality or malfunction of the
reproductive organs which lead to sterility of the
husband and/or wife; (b) psychological factors which
manifest themselves in two different ways, as (1)
psychosomatic infertility where psychic tension,
strain, or the intense desire to avoid parenthood apparently interferes with the reproductive process and
(2) voluntary childlessness where there is a deliberate
decision by the husband and/or wife not to have
children and to use birth control and/or induced
abortion to prevent any live births. Since in reality it
is extremely problematic to separate the two manifestations of psychological factors, for the purpose of
this paper a dichotomy of involuntary-voluntary will
be used.

one or both of the marital pair” (Veevers,
1971, pp. 287-288). However, rarely are
inquiries made of the woman as to
whether she is deliberately remaining
childless or if she is unable to conceive.?
One widely available data source which
does not inquire about the causes of
childlessness, and yet does contain a
wealth of information pertaining to social
and economic characteristics of the woman, is the census. The purpose of this
paper is to examine the relationship between income and childlessness using census data and to demonstrate whether this
relationship is different for involuntary
than for voluntary childlessness.

PREVIOUS STUDIES

Several studies have examined the relationship between income and childlessness. Using the April 1952 Current Population Survey, Grabill and Glick (1959)
selected women 15 to 44 years of age who
were currently married with husband present and who had urban or rural-nonfarm

2 Several studies have inquired into causes of
childlessness, for example, Freedman et al., 1959,
Whelpton et al., 1966, and others.

Vol. 24, No. 4 Income and
residence. The per cent childless in this
sample was examined in relation to the
husband’s income. Contrary to their expectations, they found high rates of
childlessness in the low income groups,
decreasing percentages of childlessness
with increased income until the highest
income group, and then again an increasing per cent of childless women. They
suggested that nonwhites, who were concentrated in the low income groups, may
have had more physiological problems
preventing them from having children and
that the role conflict of working wives,
who also tended to be wives of low income
husbands, may have encouraged them to
remain voluntarily childless (Grabill and
Glick, 1959). The reasons implied both
voluntary and involuntary childlessness.

Using the 1960 U.S. census, Kunz et al.
(1973) further analyzed the relationship
between husband’s income and childlessness. In general, even after controlling for
race, occupation, and education of the
husband, they found an inverse relationship between income and childlessness. In
their explanation of these findings, the authors emphasized involuntary childlessness. For example, high income women
may find it easier than others to consult a
doctor for problems during pregnancy,
whereas a lack of prenatal care for low
income women may result in more pregnancy losses. They also suggested that low
income women may not have the money to
obtain medical care to correct problems
which may be causing sterility (e.g., artificial insemination in cases of low sperm
count).

Poston (1974, p. 297) pointed out that
“the bulk of the interpretation of the inverse relationship between income and
childlessness does not admit the possibility
that some couples may choose voluntarily
to have no children.” He suggested that
perhaps voluntary childlessness had in
general been ignored because it is “a state

Childlessness 327
neither supported nor encouraged by our
society’s normative and value structure”
(Poston, 1974, p. 297). Two studies had
been done which examined highly selected
groups of voluntarily childless couples
(Gustavus and Henley, 1971; Veevers,
1973). Drawing from these studies, Poston
indicated that as many of the voluntarily
childless couples “become more involved
in their respective careers, the costs of
bearing children, economic and otherwise,
become increasingly important in their
decision to remain childless” (Poston,
1974, p. 299). He hypothesized that the
relationship between voluntary childlessness and income was direct and that one
reason for the inverse or somewhat curvilinear relationship of childlessness with
income found previously was due to the
greater number of involuntarily than voluntarily childless women. In order to test
this hypothesis, he chose a group of white
women, 35-44 years of age, married once,
who were wives of civilian household
heads employed in nonfarm occupations.
These women were married at age 22
years or later and were in the labor force.
According to Poston, this group of women
should have fairly high rates of voluntary
childlessness. His analysis suggested that
this was true, although his “findings were
far from definitive confirmation of the hypothesis” (Poston, 1974, p. 306).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present analysis is a further test of
the hypotheses set out by Poston (1974),
that is, that voluntary childlessness is directly related to income while involuntary
childlessness is inversely related to income. Data for the present analysis come
from the 1971 Canadian census 1/100
public use sample tapes. Using the entire
Canadian population, two groups are defined: French Catholics and British ProDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

testants.> These groups are further subdivided by place of residence (urban* and
rural5) and education (Grade 8 or less education and more than Grade 8 education).
Only currently married women 40 to 54
years of age are included.®

In this analysis, the rate of childlessness
among the rural French Catholics will be
used to represent the maximum rate of
physiological childlessness. This usage as
3 Protestants are those whose religion is Anglican,
Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, or
United Church. Catholics are those whose religion is
Roman Catholic. British are those whose cultural or
ethnic background traced through their father’s side
is from the British Isles and include English, Irish,
Welsh, etc., while French are those whose background traced through their father’s side is French.
Only those who are both French and Catholic are
included in the French Catholic group. Similarly,
only those who are both British and Protestant are
included in the British Protestant group (Canada,
1975).

* Urban includes women living in urban places as
defined by the census, i.e., incorporated cities,
towns, and villages with a population of 1,000 or
over; unincorporated places of 1,000 or over having a
population density of at least 1,000 per square mile;
and urbanized fringes (Canada, 1975).

5 Rural includes both farm and rural nonfarm.

6 There are several reasons for including only
women of these ages: (1) By the time women have
reached 40 years of age fertility is almost entirely
completed. It has been estimated that only 0.6 per
cent of childless U.S. women over age 40 in 1965
would have a child (Shryock and Siegel, 1973). (2)
Women over age 54 are not included because poor
memory would become a more important factor as
the women grow older; in addition, it is possible that
differential mortality might be a biasing factor. (3) In
recent years there have been tremendous fluctuations
in fertility in Quebec which would be important factors if younger women were included. (4) Older
French Catholic women who have completed their
families would probably be less likely to use contraception or abortion than younger women who are
still in the child-bearing years. Furthermore, when
examining data collected in 1961, Veevers (1972, p.
286) found that “a comparison of young women aged
30 to 44 with women over the age of 45 indicates
that in every instance the rate of childlessness is
lower among younger women than among women of
completed childbearing, controlling for rural-urban
residence and for province.” She concluded from her
analysis that not all these changes can be attributed
to younger age at marriage. In addition, since health
conditions have probably improved, a slight decrease
in involuntary childlessness, or a similar rate, would
be expected. However, if childlessness for all groups
had been increasing, this fact would have implied
that contraception and abortion were being used
more to bring about childlessness (even in the rural
French Catholic group), and thus the hypotheses set
out would be less valid.

Wolowyna

Social Biology

sumes that the rate of physiological sterility is similar in both rural and urban
areas, for French Catholics and British
Protestants, and for different educational
levels. However, it is expected that contraception and abortion would be used less
by the French Catholics than by the
British Protestants in all cases. It would
further be expected that within each
ethnic-religious group rural women would
be less likely than urban women, and
those with lower education less likely than
those with higher education, to use contraception and abortion to result in
childlessness.’? Since it is suggested that
income is directly related to voluntary
childlessness and inversely related to involuntary childlessness, it would be expected that the inverse relationship would
be more pronounced in those groups
which are less likely to use contraception
and abortion than in those groups which
are more likely to use them. In the latter
case, the direct relationship tends to cancel
out the inverse one. Therefore, the following hypotheses will be tested:

1. There is an inverse relationship between income and childlessness which will
be more pronounced in each of the French
Catholic groups than in the comparable
British Protestant groups. (For example,
the relationship between income and
childlessness for rural French Catholics
will be more negative than the relationship
between income and childlessness for the
British Protestants.)

2. Within each ethnic-religious group,
the relationship will be more negative for
those with ‘Grade 8 or less education than
for those with more than Grade 8 education and more negative for those who live
in rural places than for those who live in
urban places.

7 These assumptions are similar to those made by
Veevers (1972). She suggests that rural farm women
in Quebec who are nearly all Roman Catholic represent an almost entirely involuntarily childless population.

Income and

Vol. 24, No. 4

The income measure used is family income which is subdivided into 23 groups.
The per cent of women who are childless
in each income group is correlated with
the midpoint of each family income category. The relationship between family income and per cent childless will be reported as the product-moment correlation
coefficient.

RESULTS

The percentages of women who are
childless in each income group for both
French Catholics and British Protestants
are shown in Table 1. The overall per cent
of childless women is 10.4 for the British
Protestant group and 9.2 for the French
Catholic group.

Five correlation coefficients are calculated for the French Catholics and the
British Protestants respectively: total
sample, urban residence, rural residence,
Grade 8 education or less, and more than
Grade 8 education. Table 2 shows these
results. It can be seen that for the French
Catholics the relationship between
childlessness and income is inverse. The
relationship is the same strength for both
urban and rural residence. However, the
inverse relationship is stronger for those
women with Grade 8 education or less but
weaker, although still negative, for those
with more than Grade 8 education. In the
British Protestant group, there are weaker

Although it appears that the results are
in the expected direction, it is necessary to
verify this assumption with tests of significance. Since the number of income
intervals is quite small, differences observed in the correlation coefficients may
be due to chance. From Table 3 it can be
seen that there are significant differences
between the correlation coefficients for the
French Catholics and British Protestants
for the total sample and for the subgroup
with Grade 8 education or less. That is,
for the total sample and the lower educational group the relationship between income and childlessness is significantly
more negative for the French Catholics
than for the British Protestants. In addition, within each ethnic-religious group
there are significant differences by education; that is, for both the French Catholics
and British Protestants the relationship
between income and childlessness is more
negative for the less educated than for the
more educated.

DISCUSSION

This study was initiated to test further
the relationship between income and
childlessness suggested by Poston (1974).
Prior to Poston’s work, data had been pre

sented which suggested that the relationship was inverse or somewhat curvilinear.
The interpretations of these findings emphasized childlessness due to involuntary
factors while essentially ignoring voluntary childlessness. No attempt was made
to determine if income was related in the
same way to both voluntary and involuntary childlessness. Poston, however, hypothesized that the relationship between
voluntary childlessness and income was
direct. His findings, although not definitive confirmation, supported his hypothesis.

Using a somewhat different approach,
this analysis has attempted to substantiate
Poston’s findings. As predicted, for the
French Catholics, income was negatively
related to childlessness; and except in the
case of the highly educated group, these
relationships appeared to be stronger than
those for the British Protestants. In the
case of the British Protestants, the rural
and low education groups had a weaker
negative relationship between income and
childlessness while no relationship existed
for the urban group and for the group with
higher education. However, once tests of
significance were done, not all of these
differences proved to be significant.

These findings add support to the hy

pothesis that income is directly related to
voluntary childlessness and inversely related to involuntary childlessness. Among
all groups of women, physiological factors
prevent a certain proportion from bearing
children. As Kunz et al. (1973) suggest,
these factors are probably more pronounced in the lower income groups due to
poorer health care and fewer resources for
correcting sterility problems. In addition,
for some groups of women, the costs of
children, economic and otherwise, are
such that they voluntarily remain childless. This phenomenon is probably more
common in the upper income groups
(Poston, 1974). However, some women—
for example, French Catholic women because of religious beliefs—are more likely
than others to refrain from voluntary
childlessness. For the French Catholics in
general, the inverse relationship between
income and childlessness was more pronounced than that for the British Protestants. The British Protestants do not have
religious constraints against childlessness.

Childlessness 331

Thus, if they perceive that the costs of
children are high because of desires for
other commodities and role conflicts for
women who have job or career commitments, they are more likely to remain voluntarily childless. Education appeared to
be more influential in the relationship than
did place of residence. Because of restricted sample size, both place of residence and education could not be controlled simultaneously, and thus the independent effects of these two factors could
not be examined separately.

Although not conclusive, these findings
add more support to the suggestion that
income is related differently to voluntary
chil“lessness than it is to involuntary
c dlessness. They also emphasize the
iniportance of separation of childlessness
by cause in future research.
