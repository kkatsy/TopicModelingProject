Note on the Reliability and Validity
of Mothers’ Retrospective Reports

of Their Children’s Birthweights

ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1973, 1976, and 1982 National Survey of Family Growth
Studies, mothers’ retrospective reports of their children’s birthweights are compared across
surveys and with vital registration data. Comparisons focus on estimated levels for blacks and
whites, and on the effects of possible determinants. Despite the fact that nonresponse is more
common for blacks, especially for births occurring at dates more distant from the surveys,
results show that retrospective reports of low birthweight (< 5.5 pounds) provide valid and

reliable estimates of trends and differentials.

Data of demographic interest are
routinely collected retrospectively, including birth and pregnancy histories.
Sometimes information about each (or a
selected) birth is gathered. For example, the National Survey of Family
Growth (NSFG) asks questions about
the sex, birthweight, breastfeeding,
length of gestation, and survival of each
child. These data are an important supplement to vital registration data because they provide a much greater range
of information than is available from
birth certificates. Such information, like
smoking behavior or whether the birth
was planned, might help account for
birthweight variability or its consequences.

This note addresses the accuracy of
retrospective reports of children’s birthweight. Such an examination is especjally timely. The U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (1986)
identifies low birthweight as the major

140

contributing factor to infant mortality in
the United States. Of special concern is
the large and parallel disparity in birthweight and infant mortality between
blacks and whites. Much research into
these disparities will use retrospective
reports like those examined here; and
the NSFG, specifically, will be a major
data source used for such work.

To test the reliability of birthweight
reports, we take advantage of repeated
cross-sectional surveys—the 1973, 1976,
and 1982 NSFG. Since the data are retrospective reports, the relevant information for some birth cohorts is available from more than one survey. For
each cohort, we examine whether the
different surveys provide similar estimates and differentials.

We will also assess validity by comparing trends from the NSFG with vital
registration data. Since the vital registration data come from birth certificates
this data will be accurate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Table 1 describes the NSFG surveys
we analyze. The sample size shown in
the fifth column is for female respondents. The unit of analysis in our study is
births to these women. The sixth
column shows the total number of births
to women interviewed in the NSFG surveys; and the next column shows the
number who meet the (race, age, and
period) criteria for inclusion into our
analysis.

Only births to black and white
women are included in our analysis.
Further, because of the age restrictions
of the NSFG (see Table 1), estimates for
earlier periods (and therefore, for a
given period, estimates from more recent surveys) are biased toward younger
women. To correct for this bias, we consider only births to women less than age
35 and include from each survey only
the most recent ten-year period. Thus,
overlapping estimates of low birth

weight can be obtained for birth cohorts
1967-72 from the 1973 and 1976 NSFG.
Similarly, estimates for birth cohorts
1972-75 can be obtained from both the
1976 NSFG and the 1982 NSFG. For
birth cohort 1972, estimates can be obtained across all three surveys.

In each survey, interviewers asked
women to recall the birthweights of all
their live births. Following the strategy
of most researchers, we have defined
“low birthweight” as less than 5.5
pounds.

Several preliminary comments on interpretation are warranted. First, we
search for study effects with a “shotgun”
approach. That is, we have not specified
hypotheses about where and why study
effects should appear. Due to chance
alone, this approach will produce an occasional statistically significant study effect. Secondly, our statistical tests are
based on the assumption of simple random sampling. Since all modern national national samples are clustered,

Figure 1 low birthweight estimates
(weighted to produce national estimates) for whites and blacks. Also
shown as a solid trend line are vital statistics estimates. Comparisons between
the NSFG data and vital statistics can be
made for the full 1963-81 period. However, prior to 1969, vital statistics included blacks tn the ‘“‘All Other” cate
gory. This inconsistency in definition is

reflected by a break in the trend line.

The NSFG estimates vary sharply
from year to year. Because of the
smaller sample size of black births, estimates for blacks are more variable than
for whites. Note that three-year averages of these estimates would pull them
into closer correspondence with the vital
statistics data.

The biggest differences between the
NSFG estimates and those made from
vital statistics data are found in the years
1965, 1970, 1972, and 1974 for blacks.
Although visual inspection of the NSFG
data might suggest that the incidence of
low birthweight is declining for blacks,
regression analysis, weighted for outliers, reveals no significant change
across year (results not shown here). In
addition, none of the individual points
lie more than two standard deviations
from the vital statistics trend line which
shows no evidence of decline.

COMPARISON OF Low BIRTHWEIGHT
ESTIMATES ACROSS SURVEYS

Using unweighted data for cohorts
represented in more than one survey,
we show in Table 2 the distribution of
births by low birthweight (<5.5 or 5.5
pounds or greater) and the date of the
survey. From the first panel, for whites
and blacks respectively, the 1973 NSFG
estimated odds of low birthweight are
0.84 and 0.99 as great as the 1976 odds.
The chi-squares associated with these

Brief Reports 143

odds ratios (3.6 and 0.01, with 1 degree
of freedom) indicate that these odds ratios are not significantly different from
1.0 (at the 0.05 significance level). These
results demonstrate a close correspondence across surveys; observed differences in low birthweight could result
easily from sampling variability. Statistics in Panel 2 and 3 can be similarly interpreted. Only for whites born between
1972~75S are estimates significantly different (at the 0.05 level). The 1976
NSFG estimate is over 40 per cent
higher than the 1982 one. This difference can be seen in Figure 1 but does not
appear as a major discrepancy. Again,
some statistically significant differences
were found, but they were few in number and formed no interpretable pattern
(results not presented here). These differences in levels, although rare, are
more frequent than would be expected
given simple random sampling and no
difference between surveys.

BIRTHWEIGHT DIFFERENTIALS ACROSS
SURVEYS

The above analyses tested whether
overall levels are similar across surveys.
In most cases, they were. But even if
they are not, differentials could be estimated reliably. Suppose a shift in question wording or procedure produced an
increase in the reported incidence of low
birthweight. As long as this artifactual
effect is pervasive, then it would not affect differences between groups. Such
an assumption is commonly made. For
instance, vital registration data show
that divorces are under-reported in retrospective marriage histories like those
collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS). However, divorce differentials seem to be reliably estimated from
CPS data (see Thornton and Rodgers,
1978).

We use logistic regression to estimate
the effects of mother’s education and
mother’s age at child’s birth on the likelihood that a birth is less than 5.5
pounds. As expected, estimated effects
indicate that births to teen mothers and
to those with less education were at
greater risk of being low birthweight
(results not shown). Replicating results
from the previous section, the only
significant (level) effect of study was in
the comparison of the 1976 and 1982
surveys (cohorts 1972~75) where the
1976 survey shows significantly higher
levels. Thus, this difference remains after basic controls are introduced.

Our primary interest lies in possible
interactive effects with another covariate. Since the birth cohort experience
we have selected from the various surveys is identical, no interactions are expected. If we find none, then we cannot
reject the hypothesis that the effects of
covariates are equal in the two (or three)
surveys.

Results (not shown) indicate slightly
more significant interactions than would
be expected by chance; but they are
scattered, not systematic, suggesting
sampling variability as the most likely
explanation.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Results presented and described here
are generally encouraging. Levels and
trends obtained from retrospective reports generally match vital registration
data. Given that vital registration data is
highly accurate, this result indicates
valid measurement of birthweight from
retrospective reports. Second, similar
levels and trends are obtained from retrospective reports obtained several
years apart. Further, levels and differentials estimated in one survey closely
correspond with overlapping experience
in other surveys. Thus, retrospective reports also appear reliable. There are
scattered significant differences that
should caution researchers against overinterpreting unexpected effects that
have not been (or cannot be) replicated
with a second survey.

Our generally encouraging results
are consistent with those reported by
Swicegood et al. (1984) with respect to
the reliability of reports concerning the
timing of the first birth. Studies of retrospective reports of “‘early” initiation of
sexual activity (Kahn et al., 1988) and
reports of marital disruption (Preston
and McDonald, 1979; Thornton and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

Rodgers, 1987) suggest that such reports
underestimate levels, but that differentials estimated from such data are unbiased. In contrast, procedures for obtaining retrospective reports of abortion are
not accurate. Taken together, these
findings confirm common beliefs that
retrospective reports will be more accurate: if the event/information is important to the respondent (and, thus, likely
to be remembered), and if the event/
information is less normatively sensitive
(so that respondents feel free to report
what they remember). For mothers (the
respondents), births and the events surrounding them are likely to be remembered. Further, parenthood is normatively approved, and birthweight is

likely viewed as an objective fact. Initiation of intercourse and marital disruptions are major life events too, but they
are more normatively sensitive. Abortions, while likely remembered, are unlikely to be reported accurately because
reliable normative support for abortions
does not exist. Additional studies of the
validity and reliability of retrospective
reports are needed to elaborate a theory
of bias/error in retrospective reports.
