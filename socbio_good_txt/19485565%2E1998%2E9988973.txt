ABSTRACT: Using data from the World Fertility and Demographic and Health Surveys of
Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, we model the effects of education on three demographic outcomes:
the timing of first sexual union, contraceptive use, and fertility. These effects are examined over
time and across geographic areas using a multivariate framework. We find substantial improvements in female educational attainment over the last fifty years and a strong relationship between education and the demographic outcomes. Each successive increment in education is associated with declines in the marriage rate, increased contraceptive use, and lower fertility.
Education accounts for some of the changes over time in the demographic outcomes, but the
pattern varies by outcome, time period, and geographic area. In support of the social diffusion
hypothesis, our results indicate that educational differences in reproductive behavior are reduced as the level of development increases and societies pass through their demographic transi
tion.

The International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo (September, 1994) and the U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing (September,
1995) both emphasized the importance of
factors that influence the status and wellbeing of women. Although women’s status is not often clearly defined and measurement may be elusive (Mason, 1993),
there is broad agreement that improvements in educational attainment are one
of the best means available to achieve this
goal (Caldwell, 1986; Palloni, 1981). Education is a popular policy target because
few groups are opposed to education, the
basic infrastructure is often in place, and
because a wide variety of outcomes are
presumed to be influenced by education.
Nonetheless, some have questioned the
universality of benefits from educational
expansion (Knodel and Jones, 1996).

In order to be effective as a policy
tool, education should exhibit several
properties as a variable. First, it needs to
be manipulable. Dramatic improvements
in educational attainment in many countries indicate that educational improvement is an attainable goal. Second, education should have a large impact on
important outcomes. Although cause and
effect cannot be proven with available
data, strength of statistical relationships
between education and important decisions about critical life events is a necessary condition that can be assessed.
Third, statistical relationships should be
evident temporally rather than just crosssectionally. Change in education should
be associated with change in desired outcomes. Fourth, the effects of education
should be resilient across a variety of cultural, socioeconomic, or geographic set

tings. Fifth, given the multidimensional
nature of women’s status, education
should influence a range of decisions
women make. This paper assesses these
properties of education in three Latin
American countries at different stages in
the demographic transition.

Education is assumed to influence
women’s decisions and improve their autonomy through a variety of mechanisms.
First, education provides basic skills such
as literacy which allow women to gather information more effectively and to evaluate
alternatives. Second, education promotes a
more rational approach to decision-making.
In particular, education provides a source of
knowledge by imparting literacy and other
cognitive skills that enable individuals to
process information and interact with their
surroundings (Castro Martin and Juarez,
1995; Jejeebhoy, 1995). Third, education
opens the door to socioeconomic advancement. A heightened sense of options and
the ability to achieve those options can increase aspirations for a higher standard of
living. Fourth, schooling plays an important role in the transforming of attitudes.
Increased education transforms aspirations
and encourages the questioning of traditional beliefs and practices (Castro Martin
and Juarez, 1995). Fifth, because of the
cultural value placed on education, it enhances the status of women. Finally, because of each of the above noted influences, higher education increases the
autonomy of women. Improved skills, a
more rational approach to decision-making, increased alternatives, higher aspirations, and higher status combine to give
women more control over their own lives
(Kasarda et al., 1986; Eisemon, 1987; Castro Martin, 1995; Jejeebhoy, 1995).

Although the importance of each
mechanism is rarely evaluated (see Cas
Education as Policy

195

tro Martin and Juarez, 1995, for an exception), research results consistently
show that a variety of outcomes are associated with higher educational attainment
(Jejeebhoy, 1995). We have selected three
outcomes as indicators that women have
control over their reproductive lives. Prior
research indicates that higher educational
attainment will be associated with later
age at marriage, higher levels of contraceptive use (including the use of more effective methods), and lower fertility (Jejeebhoy, 1995).

There is ample evidence that each of
these outcomes is associated with educational attainment. One of the most consistent findings in the literature is the negative relationship between education and
fertility (Cochrane, 1979; Muhuri et al.,
1994; Castro Martin, 1995; Guzman et
al., 1996; Jejeebhoy, 1995). Previous
studies show a negative relationship between education and fertility in Latin
America, but the strength of the relationship is contingent upon the level of socioeconomic development and the social
and cultural context of the region (Castro
Martin, 1995; Jejeebhoy, 1995). In addition, the magnitude of fertility differentials between education levels varies dramatically in Latin America relative to
other countries (Muhuri et al., 1994).
Cross-national research based on the
World Fertility Surveys found the largest
fertility differentials by education in
Latin America (United Nations, 1987),
and recent studies of the first wave of the
DHS have provided similar results (Castro Martin, 1995; Guzman et al., 1996).

Dramatic increases in the education
levels of women and greater access to
family planning services have increased
modern contraceptive use among women
in many Latin American countries (Florez

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

196

et al., 1990; Castro Martin and Juarez,
1994). Better educated women are more
likely to desire smaller families and are
more motivated to use contraception relative to less educated women (Roosta,
1989; Weinberger et al., 1989; Jejeebhoy,
1995). In addition to providing motivation for lower fertility, education also
provides knowledge about how to obtain
and use contraception, and possibly
greater resources if cost is a factor (Castro Martin, 1995; Roosta, 1989). Thus,
educated women are better informed
about contraceptive options and sources,
and they are more likely to use effective
methods of birth control compared to
their less educated counterparts (Castro
Martin, 1995).

Changes in age at marriage are also influenced by education in Latin America
(Weinberger et al., 1989; Castro Martin,
1995). Studies of the influence of education on fertility-related behaviors in Latin
America have found that more-educated
women generally enter sexual untons later
than less-educated women (Weinberger et
al., 1989; Jejeebhoy, 1995). Although
some of this effect is because women delay entry into unions while they are in
school, education is often completed well
before marriage in Third World countries
where overall educational attainment is
low. Thus, other mechanisms are also presumed to operate. Women with more education may have greater expectations of
their spouse’s ability to provide a good
lifestyle, so they wait for a spouse with
better prospects. As their lives are not totally defined by marriage, they may also
feel less pressure to begin married life at a
young age (Chowdhury and Trovato,
1994; Heaton, 1996). With increased education, women have more alternatives to
marriage and are more likely to postpone

Heaton and Forste

Social Biology

or even reject marriage. Early age at marriage reflects an absence of meaningful
alternatives to marriage, as well as a lack
of autonomy to make decisions about
marriage (Chowdhury and Trovato, 1994;
Heaton, 1996).

Specifically, we address three important
questions regarding the influence of education on women’s lives in three Latin
American countries—Colombia, Peru, and
Bolivia: (1) What is the relationship between education and the reproductive decisions women make, including age at
marnage, contraceptive use, and family
size? (2) To what degree do changes in education account for changes in these three
demographic outcomes? (3) Does the influence of education vary by context?

Most studies of the relationship between education and demographic outcomes is based on cross-sectional data, or
at best retrospective data from a survey
done at one point in time. Notable exceptions are studies by Weinberger and colleagues (1989), Castro Martin (1995),
and Rodriguez (1996). Each of these
studies indicates that educational expansion is associated with fertility decline.
Less attention is given to other outcomes.

Building upon these studies, we analyze the effects of education on fertilityrelated outcomes at three points in time
(WFS, DHS I, DHS II) to determine the
effect of education on reproductive control over time. In this study we compare
inter-cohort differences, and differences
between surveys taken at different points
in time to see if the observed changes in
education can account for changes in
family formation behavior.

In addition, we consider the context
within which education operates. Crossnational data show that the influence of
education is more likely to operate in cer

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

tain contexts than in others (Jejeebhoy,
1995). For example, the impact due to increased orientation toward alternatives
other than full-time homemaking will be
greater in urban areas and in countries
where there is a labor market for female
employment. The effects of contraceptive
use will be greater in areas where contraception is accessible, in particular in
countries that have extensive family planning networks. Differences in fertility for
education level tend to decrease as contraceptive use increases in a population.
According to the social diffusion hypothesis, educational differences in contraceptive use are greatest in countries at the beginning and middle stages of the fertility
transition when the most educated are the
innovators in adopting family planning.
Differentials narrow at the final stages of
the transition as fertility control becomes
more common and is used by the majority of women (Castro Martin, 1995; Bongaarts and Watkins, 1996). We anticipate
that the effects of education will, thus,
vary by the degree of urbanization and
the transition stage of each country.

In sum, we examine the effects of education on the timing of first union, contraceptive use, and fertility rates. In addition,
we examine these relationships as they
vary over time, and across geographic areas defined by country and urban residence. Focusing on factors related to fertility, we examine reductions between the
mid-1970’s and the early 1990’s in
Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Although
these three countries share much of the
same history and are geographically proximate, they represent three varying levels of
development. Colombia has experienced
rapid unbalanced modernization with
widely dispersed growing centers of commerce. Modernization in Peru has been

Education as Policy

197

partial, whereas in Bolivia development is
only incipient (Wilkie and Ochoa, 1989).

Besides representing different levels of
socioeconomic development, these three
countries also are at different stages of the
fertility transition. Colombia has reached
an advanced transition stage, reducing by
half its fertility rate since the beginning of
the 1960’s (Guzman, 1994). Birth rates in
Colombia began to fall in the late 1960’s,
and in 1970 the government adopted an
official policy to support family planning
in an effort to reduce population growth.
Family planning services were integrated
with maternal and child health services,
and efforts were made to avoid confrontations with the Catholic Church (Merrick,
1986). The fertility decline in Colombia
began in urban areas and then spread later
to rural areas. Contraception is used by
Colombian women not only to limit the total number of births, but also to space
births, although the spacing of births is
largely limited to urban women (Florez,
1992; Shah, 1991).

Compared to Colombia which has a
very strong family planning program,
Peru’s family planning efforts have been
relatively weak (Weinberger et al., 1989;
Ferrando and Avanburu, 1996). Peru is at
an intermediate transition level, moving
from high fertility levels in the early
1960’s to a moderate rate of 4.0 in 1990
(Guzman, 1994). Birth rates in Peru began to decline during the 1970’s. National
family planning programs were begun in
Peru in the 1960's, then were interrupted
by the military government until 1974
when the government resumed support
for family planning. However, efforts to
promote family planning in Peru have
been very limited (Rivera and Espenshade, 1995). Information on the availability of contraceptives in Peru remains

198

scarce (Kost, 1993). The fertility decline in
Peru over the past decade has been greatest
among the urban population (White et al.,
1995).

Bolivia has experienced a late or delayed transition with total fertility rates
declining to only about 5.0 by 1990 (Guzman, 1994; Pinto, 1996). Between 1974
and 1976 the Bolivian government promoted family planning through health
clinics. Because of cultural opposition,
some family planning programs were coercive, Sterilizing peasant women without
their knowledge. Family planning efforts
in this country have come under attack by
the Catholic Church, and currently there
is no Official population control program
in Bolivia (Rance, 1990). Contraceptives
in Bolivia are largely used to limit family
size, not to space births. For the most part,
Bolivian women lack the autonomy to
regulate their own fertility (Rance, 1990).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this analysis come from the
World Fertility Surveys (WFS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
These surveys were selected because they
offer the best available mix of quality
control during data collection, national
coverage, and comparability over time
and across countries. Although the specific content of the surveys varies over
time and across countries, each includes
detailed birth histories and information
on desired fertility, education, contraceptive use, age at first union, and place of
residence. Dates of these surveys (WES,
DHS I, DHS II-III) for Colombia are
1976, 1986, and 1990; for Peru 1977/78,
1986, and 1991/92; and for Bolivia 1989
and 1993/94 (Bolivia did not participate
in the WFS). The time span between

Heaton and Forste

 

Social Biology

WES and DHS ranges from eight to ten
years, while intervals between the first
and second DHS surveys are only four to
five years.

We treat education as a categorical
variable because effects of education are
not necessarily linear (Jejeebhoy, 1995).
We distinguish between no _ formal
schooling, primary education, secondary
education, and post-secondary education.
This simple approach obviously masks
some differences between countries and
does not take into account changes in educational systems within countries. More
detailed classifications would reduce the
degree of comparability between countries. Moreover, educational reforms
within countries have occurred at different times in different regions and are not
always well documented.

Previous studies of the association between education and fertility used the decomposition-of-difference method (see
Weinberger et al., 1989; Castro Martin,
1995). The change in the total fertility
rate (and other fertility-related factors)
during the inter-survey period was disaggregated into three components: rates
(changes in education-specific rates), education (changes due to improvements
in women’s education), and interaction
(change across educational groups). We
opt not to use this method because decomposition models are considered
“crude approximations of the real effects”
(Moreno, 1991, p. 337). Also, the method
is applied to aggregate data, making it difficult to demonstrate a link between fertility and other individual characteristics
such as education or urban residence.
Although the decomposition can be done
for different subgroups of the population
or can be correlated with communitylevel characteristics (c.f., Gertler and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

Molyneaux, 1994), this method is not designed to examine the effects of individual
attributes on fertility in a multivariate
framework. Instead, using individual level
data, we examine the effects of education
on the three outcomes using multivariate
techniques.

Since each outcome has a different
distribution, different statistical procedures are appropriate for each outcome.
Age at first union includes both legal
marriages and consensual unions. For
simplicity we refer to both types of sexual unions as “marriage.” Analysis is restricted to women who have ever been in
a sexual union, because the Peruvian
WFS did not include women who had
never been in a union. Only about 5 per
cent of the births in Colombia, 3 per cent
of the births in Peru, and 4 per cent of the
births in Bolivia are to women who report
never being in a sexual union. Age at first
union is estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.

Because many women in some regions
of Latin America have only used traditional contraceptive methods, the distinction between modern (i.e., pill, IUD, condom, injections, vaginal methods, and
sterilization) and traditional (i.e., withdrawal, rhythm, and folk methods) methods is included. Separate models are estimated for (1) the use of any contraceptive
method versus no use, and (2) the use
of modern versus traditional methods.
Women who have never used modern
methods are included in the “modern”
category. Because these two models have
dichotomous outcomes, logistic regression is used in the models of contraceptive use.

In the models of contraceptive use, a
control variable is included measuring the
gap between ideal family size and chil
Education as Policy

199

dren ever born. This measure 1s included
based on the logic that Latin American
women will generally not use birth control until they are getting close to or have
achieved their desired family _ size.
Women of higher socioeconomic status in
urban areas of Colombia increasingly use
birth control to space births, but the rural
Colombian women and the majority of
women in Peru and Bolivia use family
planning only after desired family size is
achieved (Florez et al., 1990; Rance,
1990).

Age-specific and total fertility rates
are calculated based on the five years preceding each survey in order to examine
trends. Analysis is limited to the preceding five years because recall error tends
to increase with longer time intervals.
Age-specific rates are calculated as the
number of births to women in a given
five-year age interval divided by the total
years women were alive during that age
interval.

Standard multivariate statistical procedures cannot be applied to age-specific or
total fertility rates, because there is not a
single value associated with each woman.
Rather, each age-specific rate summarizes
the experience of various women, and
most women will have experience in
more than one age category during the
preceding five years, thus contributing to
two different age-specific rates. In this
paper, a variation of log-linear analysis is
used to assess the influence of time period and several covariates on age-specific fertility rates. The general form of
the model is presented in the equation below: B refers to the number of births; E,
to exposure time; 7; to time period; A, to
age group; and C, to education. Matrices
are constructed by aggregating births and
exposure times within categories of age

200

and education. Data are then weighted by
the number of births; exposure times are
included as cell weights; and age and education are treated as variables (Yamaguchi, 1991; Laird and Oliver, 1981).
Parameters show the influence of age
group and education on the log of the
age-specific birth rates. Because the last
age category has very few births, inclusion of this group would introduce many
empty cells. Thus, the last age category is
excluded to avoid problems created by
empty cells in log-linear analysis. Parameters for age group are not reported because they are not of central interest.

Type of residence (urban or rural) is
included as a measure of the geographic
and structural context. In addition, the effects of education on the various outcomes are examined separately by country, allowing us to further determine how
the influence of education varies by context. Equation (1) presents the general
form of the model.

In(bjglejg) = A+ AT + AFH AE. (A)

In the first step of our analysis, separate models are estimated showing the effects of education and then time period.
Subsequent models include both time period and education, and then urban residence and interaction terms are added.
The impact of education on each outcome
is assessed by comparing period effects in
the simple model with the period effects
after education is included in the model.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows educational distributions by cohort and country, based on
pooled data combining each survey.

Social Biology

Among women born before 1940, most
Peruvians and Colombians had either a
primary education or no schooling at all.
Because Bolivia was not included in the
WES, we have no information on women
born in these earlier years, but we can infer from observed patterns in the 1940
birth cohort, that the Bolivian women
were even less educated than the Peruvians or Colombians. Since 1950 educational expansion has proceeded to the
point where nearly all women have at
least some schooling, and a majority of
women attend secondary schools. There
is also noticeable growth in higher education, especially in Peru. Bolivia still lags
behind the other two countries in extending post-primary education to women. It
should be noted that the lower rates of
higher education for the 1970’s cohort is
an artifact of the data. The 1970’s cohort
includes many younger women who, at
the time of the survey, had not yet completed their schooling.

Age at marriage.—Table 2 shows patterns of marriage (includes both legal
marriages and consensual unions) by
level of education and country. The overall relationship between education and
age at marriage is clear. More-educated
women tend to wait longer to marry in
each country. For example, nearly twothirds of women with no education were
married by their twentieth birthday in
Colombia and Peru as were half of the
women in Bolivia. In contrast, only about
a third of the Colombian and Peruvian
women and 40 per cent of the Bolivian
women with a secondary education were
married by the same age, but the effects
of education categories are not linear.
There is less difference between no education and primary education than be

the effects of education on the marriage
rate without taking other factors into account. The coefficients summarize the
differences shown in Table 1. No education is the reference category. The difference in marriage rates between women

with no education and women with primary education is not very large. In Bolivia, the rate is actually lower among
women with no education than among
those with primary education. The marriage rates are much lower, however,

among women with secondary and higher
levels of education, especially in Colombia and Peru. At higher levels of education, coefficients are a little larger in Peru
than in Colombia. In short, as women further their educational attainment beyond
primary grade levels, they delay marriage
to a substantial degree.

The next three panels of Table 3 focus
on trends over time. Model 2 shows the
trend in marriage rates by year the respondent was born. Coefficients indicate
that the marriage rate has declined by
about 1.3 per cent per year in Colombia,
2.0 per cent in Peru, and 1.1 per cent in
Bolivia. Although the decline in any given
year may be small, these numbers imply
substantial declines over longer periods of
time. When education level is included in
the equation, coefficients for birth cohort
become much smaller, indicating that educational expansion may account for
much of the historic decline in marriage
rates. Dividing the coefficient for birth
year in Model 3 by the same coefficient in
Model 2 implies that educational expansion accounts for nearly three-fourths of
the temporal decline in Colombia and
Peru, but only a one-third of the decline in
Bolivia.

Model 4 adds to the complexity by
considering whether the temporal trend
has been parallel across education levels,
or in other words whether the education
effect has changed over time. In this
model, the coefficient for birth year represents the trend for women with no education—the group not explicitly represented
with an education variable. The coefficient
iS positive in each country, indicating that
marriage rates have not declined and may
have even risen slightly among women
with no education. Changes in marriage
rates have been only slightly less positive

among women with primary education. In
contrast, temporal declines in marriages
have been large among women with secondary education, and even greater among
women with higher education.

In short, the analysis of temporal
trends indicates that much of the decline
in marriage rates is due to the increasing
number of women with secondary and
higher levels of educational attainment.
Indeed, the influence of post-primary educational attainment appears to be increasing over time. Country comparisons
support the hypothesis that educational
effects are not as large in Bolivia as in
Colombia and Peru, but the interactions
indicate that the growing importance of
education is as evident in Bolivia as in
the other two countries.

The last three panels address the difference between urban and rural areas.
Model 5 shows that the marriage rate is
lower in urban than in rural areas, but the
urban-rural difference is greatest in Peru,
intermediate in Colombia, and smallest in
Bolivia. Coefficients from Model 6 indicate that once education is taken into account, the urban effect is much smaller
and even positive in Bolivia. In other
words, urban areas have lower marriage
rates in large part because the residents
are more educated.

The final model includes interactions
between education and urbanization. Results do not form a consistent pattern. In
Colombia, the interaction coefficients are
positive indicating that primary, secondary,
and higher education have a smaller impact
on lower marriage rates in urban areas than
in rural areas. In Bolivia, the coefficients
for secondary and higher education are
negative, but not statistically significant.
Only in Peru does education play a greater
role in urban areas.

Contraceptive use.——Table 4 reports
the percentage of women who have ever
used modern contraceptives, or who used
traditional methods exclusively. In each
country and each survey, there is a strong
relationship between education and the
use of modern contraception. Use of modem contraceptives is highest in Colombia
and lowest in Bolivia, but use is increasing in each country. Use of traditional
methods—the only methods approved by
the Catholic Church—is quite low in
Colombia, but is more common in Peru
and Bolivia. The relationship between education and the use of traditional methods
is not necessarily positive because moreeducated people are more likely to use
modern rather than traditional methods.
Over time, there is a decline in the use of
traditional methods among the most-educated, as they replace traditional with
modern methods. Two sets of analyses are
reported in Tables 5 and 6. First, in Table
5 we compare those who have ever used
any method with nonusers. Then, in Table
6 we compare those who have used a
modern method with those who have only
used traditional methods.

Contraceptive use increases substantially with each increase in education,
and the increases are quite similar across
countries (see Table 5). Unlike age at
marriage, differences in contraceptive use
are evident between women with primary
schooling and those with no education.
Moreover, women with higher levels of
education are more likely to have used a
modern method (see Table 6).

The second model of each table shows
the trend over time, controlling for the
gap between achieved and desired family
size. Contraceptive use has clearly increased in each subsequent survey. For
example, contraceptive use tripled in

Heaton and Forste

 

Social Biology

Colombia between WFS and DHS I
(e!-!29 = 3.09) and was even higher by
DHS II. Likewise, use of modern methods has gained over exclusive use of traditional methods in Colombia and Peru,
but not in Bolivia where the increase in
exclusive use Of traditional methods is
more dramatic. By comparing the coefficients for survey in Models 2 and 3, we
can assess how much of the increase in
contraceptive use is accounted for by educational expansion. This difference is
largest in Peru, moderate in Colombia,
and very small in Bolivia, and the difference in coefficients is larger for any use
than for the contrast between modern and
traditional use. In other words, educational expansion accounts for a fairly
large amount of increased contraceptive
use in Peru and a moderate amount in
Colombia, but other factors are largely
responsible for increased use in Bolivia.
In addition, educational expansion does
little to explain the shift away from the
exclusive use of traditional methods.

The relationship between educational
expansion and temporal increases in contraceptive use are further elaborated in
Model 4, which tests the interaction between education and survey date. Unlike
the pattern for age at marriage where
change tended to be greatest among the
most educated, contraceptive use increased most among the least educated in
Colombia and Peru. On the other hand,
the increase in contraceptive use was
greatest among the most educated Bolivian women. Most of the interaction coefficients are not statistically significant
in the model contrasting modern and traditional methods.

Magnitudes of the coefficients suggest
that in Colombia the least-educated experienced greater change; in Peru, there was

virtually no difference by education level;
and in Bolivia, the most-educated experienced greater change. In making the
above comparisons, we must remember
that dates of marriage cover a much
broader time span—about fifty years—
than do survey dates for contraceptive
use—only about 20 years. Obviously, in
order to reach the pattern of contraceptive
use observed here, the most-educated
were the first to use modern methods in
large numbers in Colombia and Peru. This
increase occurred earlier than we can detect with the data at hand. These two
countries are now at a stage where women
with less education are beginning to catch
up. In Bolivia, however, increases in contraceptive use, especially modern methods, are still most evident among women
with higher education levels.

The final models of Tables 5 and 6 assess the difference in urban and rural areas. Model 5 indicates that the use of any
method is higher in urban than in rural
areas, and that urban residents are also
more likely to use modern rather than exclusively traditional methods. Although
the coefficients for urban residence are

reduced by the inclusion of education
(Model 6), they remain large indicating
that the urban-rural difference is not primarily a result of higher educational attainment in urban areas. Finally, tests for
interactions between urban residence and
education found no statistically significant coefficients in any country. Contrary
to our hypothesis, it seems that education
may actually make a greater difference in
rural than in urban areas in some cases.
Fertility rates—Table 7 shows total
fertility rates for each country. These rates
are calculated based on births during the
five years preceding each survey. In each
country and each survey, higher education
is associated with lower fertility. Models
showing the multivariate results are given
in Table 8. Parameters from the long-linear models indicate that birth rates decline
at higher levels of educational attainment.
Coefficients are somewhat smaller in Bolivia than in Colombia and Peru, but the
basic patterns are similar across countries.
Fertility rates have declined over time in
Colombia and Peru, but there was virtually
no difference in fertility rates in the two
Bolivian surveys. Comparing coefficients

for survey in Model 2 and Model 3 indi= cates that educational expansion does ac“ count for a portion of the fertility decline
5 between the two DHS surveys in Colom5 bia and Peru, but the decline between the
© WFS and DHS I remains largely unexoo plained by education. The coefficient for
06 DHS ITI in Bolivia is actually positive afcs ter education is taken into account, sug~ gesting that if education had not ex= panded, fertility would have increased;
Sohowever, the coefficients are very small
Sin both models. Tests for the interaction

® most-educated women in Peru, and
‘samong the least-educated women in

& category.
© Fertility is clearly lower in urban than
a in rural areas of each country. Moreover,
comparison of the coefficients for urban
residence in Models 5 and 6 indicate that
part of the reason for lower fertility in urban areas is that urban residents are more
educated. On the other hand, results also
suggest that part of the reason more-educated women have fewer births is because they are more likely to live in
cities. Finally, the interaction terms of
Model 7 indicate that the effects of

higher education on birth rates are not as
high in urban as in rural areas, especially
in Colombia and Peru. It is possible that
urban women are influenced more by
forces that lower fertility, regardless of
education levels, than are rural women.

DISCUSSION

This discussion is organized around
the five characteristics we have suggested
to evaluate education as a policy. First, we
have shown substantial improvements in
female educational attainment over the
last fifty years. Among women born after
1970, virtually all have at least some
primary education and a large majority
have at least some secondary schooling.
Whether educational improvement is
more a function of government policies or
individual motivation cannot be evaluated
with the data at hand, but the observed
dramatic increases support optimism regarding the extension of basic education
to women in Latin America.

Our study also shows strong relationship between education and each of the demographic outcomes of interest, namely,
age at marriage, contraceptive use, and fertility. In all three Latin American countries,
education influenced fundamental decisions women made about family formation. The largest impact tends to occur between primary and secondary schooling,
especially for age at marriage, but each

successive increment in education is generally associated with further declines in
the marriage rate, increased contraceptive
use (especially modern methods), and

lower fertility. Birdsall and Chester
(1987) argue that the ability of women to
control their childbearing with confidence is an important factor in raising the

status of women. With increased education, Latin American women therefore
are better able to make reproductive
choices and thus improve their status.
These findings support the claims that education is associated with substantial differences in demographic outcomes and
that the influence of education extends to
a variety of different family behaviors.

Education also accounts for some of
the trends in demographic outcomes, but
the pattern varies by outcome and time
period considered. Improvements in education explained most of the decline in
marriage rates over the past decades in
the three Latin American countries. The
expansion of education over time contributed to an increase in contraceptive
use mainly in Peru. In the case of contraceptive use, other factors such as contraceptive availability were probably more
important than educational expansion in
determining the increase over time.

The expansion of educational opportunities in Latin America accounted for
some of the decline in fertility over the
past decade (between the two DHS surveys), but only in the more developed
countries of Peru and Colombia. The
contribution of educational expansion to
declines in fertility in our study were
much smaller than findings reported in
prior studies which used a decomposition-of-difference method (Castro Martin,
1995; Weinberger et al., 1989). Weinberger and colleagues (1989) found that
improvements in education explained 40
to 67 per cent of the decline in fertility
between the WFS and DHS in Latin
America. They also indicated that fertility
declines within education categories were
substantial, accounting for a large per
cent of the decline in Colombia and to a
lesser per cent in Peru. Using multivariate

regression techniques, we found that educational expansion explained very little
of the decline between WFS and DHS J,
and only some of the decline between
DHS I and DHS II in Peru and Colombia.

The effect of education on reproductive decisions are evident in a variety of
contexts. In terms of residence, marriage
rates were lower in urban areas, as was
total fertility. However, these effects were
largely due to the increased education
levels of urban residents. A higher percentage of women in urban areas also
used contraceptives compared to their
rural counterparts. However, this effect
was not primarily due to the higher levels
of education in urban areas. Other factors, such as access to contraception,
likely play a greater role in increased
contraceptive use among urban residents
than does education. Despite these differences, the influence of education on each
outcome is evident in both rural and urban areas.

The relationship between education
and reproductive decisions varied by
country. In Colombia, a more highly developed Latin American country, the
greatest increases in contraceptive use
(especially modern methods) and declines in fertility were among the leasteducated women. In Peru, a moderately
developed country in the middle of its demographic transition, the greatest increases in contraceptive use were among
the least-educated women. However, the
greatest declines in actual fertility were
among the most-educated. In Bolivia, one
of the poorest countries in Latin America,
the largest increases in contraceptive use
(largely traditional methods) were among
the most-educated women. There was no
difference between education groups as
to fertility in the Bolivian sample. In

Colombia, the effects of education on
marriage rates was greater in rural] as opposed to urban areas. In Peru, the effect
was just the opposite—education reduced
marriage rates more in urban than rural
areas. There was no difference by residence in Bolivia as to the effect of education on marriage rates. In Latin America
generally, declines in fertility have begun
in urban areas and then later spread to
rural areas (Merrick, 1986).

Our results suggest that in more developed countries, such as Colombia, nearing
the end of their demographic transition,
contraceptive use and fertility declines
among rural women and less-educated
women are beginning to match those of
their urban and more educated counterparts. Countries in the middle of their
transition and with moderate levels of development, such as Peru, appear to be experiencing increases in contraceptive use
among the least-educated. However, the
influence of these changes on actual fertility has not yet been realized among
women with little education. The largest
declines in actual fertility are still among
the most-educated in Peru. In Bolivia, a
poor country at the early stages of its
transition, increased contraceptive use
has begun among the most-educated
women, but differences in fertility across
education categories have been negligible. ‘

We find in support of the social diffusion hypothesis that differentials by education are reduced as the level of development increases and societies move
through their demographic transition. According to this hypothesis, educational
differentials in reproductive behavior are

Education as Policy 211

likely to be greatest at the initial stages of
the fertility decline, when the most-educated women are the first to adopt family
planning, and then narrow as societies
pass through the fertility transition and
family planning is adopted by all women,
even the least-educated (Castro Martin,
1995; Bongaarts and Watkins, 1996).

Our findings suggest that as Latin
American countries pass through their
fertility transition, they pass through a
progression of increased contraceptive
use following the early stages of transition which ultimately results in declines
in actual fertility during later stages of
the transition. This progression begins
with the most-educated and urban women
and then diffuses to the least-educated
and rural women. Thus, the changes
within educational categories in Latin
America appear to have contributed more
to the fertility decline over time than has
the expansion of educational opportunities. This appearance may be a function
of the diffusion process and an associated
nonlinear relationship between trends in
educational expansion and demographic
outcomes. Initial expansion of educational opportunity to a significant proportion of women may be an important early
phase in the transition to later marriage
and greater control over fertility. However, additional research is needed to
delineate further the relationship between
education and reproductive choices
throughout the fertility transition. In
particular, the role of education in the transition from traditional to modern contraceptive use, as well as the use of contraceptives to not only limit but also space
births, require greater attention.
