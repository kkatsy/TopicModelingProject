The Strength of the B Antigen in South
African Asiatics Related to Language

Group and Religious Sect

L. V. Milner

The Natal Institute of Immunology
Durban, South Africa

A previous study from this laboratory
co (Milner and Calitz, 1968) has shown the
#3 mean strength of the B erythrocyte antigens
"s' of South African Caucasians and Asiatics to
be very similar. The Bantu were found to
"Oo have considerably stronger antigens. The
a coefficient of variation of the quantitative
© assays on the Bantu and Caucasians was
= found to be small and similar, while that of
© the Asiatics was much greater. A classifica‘= tion of the Asiatic samples by sect indicated
> that the strength of the group B antigens
© might vary from sect to sect.

This paper presents the results of quanti© tative assays of the B antigen in the four
= main ethnic groups occurring in the Asiatic
& population of Durban and its immediate
environs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Twenty-eight cell samples from each of
the four main ethnic groups in Durban and
immediate surroundings were assayed. The
Tamil, Telegu, and Hindi donors were selected on the basis of home language, and
the Moslems by religion. The blood was
taken into acid citrate dextrose (NIH formula A), and the cells were stored at 410° C for up to 48 hours before testing.

 

The same anti-B serum was used throughout these experiments. It was prepared by
pooling ten samples obtained from unstimulated group A donors. The serum had
an agglutinating titre of 1/256 by the
conventional doubling dilution technique
and gave log-probit regression lines that
were straight in the range 12% to 97%
agglutination (Solomon, Gibbs, and Bowdler, 1965).

The method used for quantitation of
haemageglutination was exactly as described
previously (Milner and Calitz, 1968). The
data was analyzed as a percentage of the
control after the manner of Solomon, Gibbs,
and Bowdler (1965).

RESULTS

Table 1 gives various statistical parameters of the findings.

Variance analysis of the data showed significant differences between the Tamil- and
Telegu-speaking people (P < 0.01), between the Tamil- and Hindi-speaking people
(P < 0.01), and between the Telegu-speaking people and the Moslems (P < 0.05).

Where there were no significant differences between the observed variances, the
t test was used to determine whether the ob

(see Table 2).

Where there were significant differences
between the observed variances, the MannWhitney U test was used (see Table 3).
There were significant differences between
all except the Hindi-speaking Hindus and
Moslems.

ORIGINS OF THE ASIATICS OF NATAL

The Tamil-speaking people of Natal came
from the provinces of Trichonopoly, Tanjore, North and South Arcut, Salem, and
Chingleput (Kuper, 1960, and Mistry, 1965)
(see Fig. 1). The Telegu-speaking people
camefromthe Andhra province, mainly from
the districts of Vizagapatam, East and West
Godavari, Kistna, Guntur, Nellore, and
Chittoor.

The Tamils have their own language,
script, and literature; for unknown reasons
they took over the caste system of the Aryan
Hindus from the north (Nowbath, 1964, p.
41), The Telegu, on the other hand, practiced the Dravidian tribal system of culture
and also developed their own language,
script, and literature, called Andhras (Nowbath, 1964). While both the Tamil and
Telegu are Hindus by religion, they differ in
certain beliefs and customs; for example, on
the occasion of Deepavali (a religious festival known as the Festival of the Lights)
Telegus become vegetarians, like the Hindispeaking people, while the Tamils do not,
It is thus obvious that the Tamil and Telegu
differ ethnically and geographically from the
Moslems and the Hindi-speaking people of
the northern part of India and also differ
linguistically and culturally from each other,

The Hindi-speaking people of Natal came
from the north and north-eastern parts
of India, mainly from the provinces of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal (Kuper, 1960).

The Moslems in Natal came predominantly from the provinces of Kathiawar,

Surat, and Porbandar, and the Moslems who
stayed in Durban belong predominantly to
the Sunni sect (Kuper, 1960).

The Mohammedans of the subcontinent
of India may be divided into two classes: the
pure Mohammedans from the Mogul and
Pathan conquering races, and Mohammedan converts who differ little racially from the
surrounding Hindu population from which

they originally sprang. South African Indian
Moslems were of the second class, many of
them representing families converted as
little as 200 years ago (Kuper, 1960; Nowbath, 1964). Ethnically, therefore, one
would not expect to find major differences
between South African Moslems and the
Hindi-speaking Hindus. The quantitative
studies presented here appear to confirm
this,

It would seem that the strength of B
antigens can be used to show relative subtle
ethnological differences. Gibbs, Akeroyd,
and Zapf (1961) showed that differences existed between the strengths of the B antigens
in Caucasians, Negroes, and Mongoloids,
and previous studies from this laboratory

have shown differences between Caucasians,
Bantu, and Asiatics (Milner and Calitz,
1968). This work demonstrates differences
between people of the same ethnic group.
