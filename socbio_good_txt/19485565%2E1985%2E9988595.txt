Regression Analysis of “Current Status” Life Tables
on Duration of Breastfeeding in Sri Lanka

ABSTRACT: This paper illustrates the application of conventional regression techniques to the
analysis of breastfeeding rates derived from the birth dates of respondents’ recent children and
their breastfeeding status at date of interview. Rates of this type have been found to be less
biased than rates based on recall of the duration of breastfeeding, but require new analytical

approaches to be fully exploited.

The durations of breastfeeding that
women report for their open and closed
birth intervals have been used in several
analyses of breastfeeding differentials
(Knodel and Debavalya, 1980; Page et
al., 1980; Akin et al., 1981; Jain and
Bongaarts, 1981), but are recognized as
being far from satisfactory. Obvious
problems are the heaping of durations at
half-yearly intervals and, in closed intervals, the restriction of data to women
with two or more live births. In the open
interval, the more important difficulty
arises that observation times are necessarily proportional to the open interval
length, favoring women whose birth intervals are long or who breastfed relatively briefly since these are the women
whose breastfeeding experience 1s most
completely reported. Cutoff dates are
sometimes imposed to remove “old” information, but this procedure does not
necessarily compensate for the bias inherent in the methodology.

Provided that women report the
dates of their children’s births with reasonable accuracy, it is possible to derive
estimates of the duration of breastfeeding of much higher quality from wom
 

en’s breastfeeding status at the time of
interview. It is that approach that the
present paper follows.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Limiting our observations to births
which occurred exactly y months prior
to interview, we construct an estimate of
the proportion of women breastfeeding
for duration y, /,, by dividing:

Number of women currently
breastfeeding a child born y
months before interview

Number of women with births y
months before interview

(For durations y <10 months the denominator will include only most recent
births, while at longer durations increasing proportions of penultimate and earlier births enter. It is assumed that none
but the most recent child would still be
breastfeeding, although this is not always true.) By ordering the proportions
still breastfeeding at progressively

longer durations, we produce a complete life table of breastfeeding continuation.

The table may be either birthweighted (by counting each birth that
occurs) or woman-weighted (by weighting each of awoman’s births by one over
the total number of her births that are
counted in the table).! For comparison,
open or closed interval data produces
woman-weighted rates, while combining open and closed intervals produces
rates that are birthweighted, or nearly
so.

The rates we have outlined will be
called “current status” rates to differentiate them from open and closed interval
rates (which may be calculated by the familiar product-limit method (cf. Kaplan
and Meier, 1958)). While much less
prone to bias than open and closed interval rates, the current status rates have
one major drawback in that they are a
collection of independent /, estimates
for the different durations. At the sample sizes available to us, it is not uncommon for a particular value /; to be higher
than an earlier value /;. Either smoothing the rates or selecting wider interval
units to increase sample sizes (for example, using quarterly rather than single
month intervals) might resolve anomalies of this sort, assuming that they are
not the result of seasonal or other period
variations in breastfeeding practices.
The problem is illustrated in Figure 1,

'Woman-weighted rates might also be generated by randomly selecting one birth from among
those occurring to each woman in the interval of
observation. This loses information, however, inasmuch as only the open interval can contribute to
the numerator in current status rates. Unlike birthweighted rates, woman-weighted rates are also
sensitive to the timepoint selected for cutoff owing
to their dependence on the number of events that
have occurred.

which shows current status breastfeeding rates for the 1974 Sri Lanka Fertility
Survey, calculated using time intervals
of different widths.”

A comparison between open interval, closed interval, and current status
breastfeeding life tables using Sri
Lankan data is presented in Figure 2, to
indicate the extent of bias to which tables of the former types are open. The
figure indicates that both closed and
open interval rates are seriously in error
at long durations. At durations less than
two years the open interval rates are satisfactory, heaping occurring mainly at
24 and 36 months. In closed intervals,
however, heaping is also severe at 12
and 18 months, biasing almost the whole
of the distribution. Restricting the data
to relatively recent periods (e.g., open
and closed intervals begun in the past
five years) only moderately changes the
figures.

To date we have not attempted to determine whether open or closed interval
data misrepresent breastfeeding differentials in the same way that they may
misrepresent overall and mean durations of breastfeeding. Since both the
degree of heaping of reported durations
and the degree of bias in the heaped interval are likely to vary among women

2In the World Fertility Surveys the dates of
births and interview are recorded in centurymonths (months elapsed since December, 1899),
making monthly intervals the smallest units of observation. To employ longer intervals, the date of
birth and interview would be recoded in the new
interval units and then subtracted. A bias results if
dates are subtracted first and the regrouping is
done on the intervals. Except for the 0 code (birth
and interview falling in the same interval), the subtracted durations correspond to exact time points,
so that for the interval Date of Interview — Date of
Birth = y, the proportion currently breastfeeding
will correspond to /,. The 0 interval corresponds to
approximately /,,,. These relationships are derived
in Smith (1980).

with different social and demographic
characteristics, the potential for misrepresentation is evidently present.

Recently, Ferry and Anderson have
pointed out that women-weighted
current-status breastfeeding rates can
be calculated from information on the
last live birth only, allowing direct comparison between open interval and current status rate estimates. The procedure they adopt is to use numbers
currently breastfeeding their last child
by child’s date of birth to construct the
numerators for current status rates. As
denominators, for all intervals longer
than about one year they use the mean
number of births per month in the last
ten or so months, for which the birth
count is likely to be complete. Details of
the methodology are given in Anderson
et al. (1984).

Restricting our attention to current
status information, four methods of data
analysis are available to us. First, we
may compare mean breastfeeding durations for selected subgroups of women,
the mean being simply the sum of the individual /, rates plus about one-half a
month. To reduce distortion when sample sizes are small, we may weight the
proportion breastfeeding at each duration by the number of observations in
the interval before the summation is carried through. The resulting figure is then
divided by the mean sample per interval
to yield the mean.*

A more direct estimate of mean
breastfeeding duration utilizing current
status data, suggested by Mosley et al.

The estimate is a linear approximation. It can
be improved slightly by replacing the value 1/2 with
\/g -f,; + 3/8 + proportion initially breastfed. Both
figures are for interval widths of one month.

‘In what follows, all means will be estimated by
this procedure.

Breastfeeding in Sri Lanka 93

(1980), is simply to divide the number of
women in a particular subgroup who are
breastfeeding, regardless of the age of
the child, by the number of births to
women in the subgroup over the past
one year or half their number of births
over the past two years. In tests with
WFS data (Ferry and Smith, 1983) these
estimates have proven to be of consistently high quality.

The shapes of /, distributions for different subgroups may also be compared, perhaps by a logit regression ona
standard breastfeeding schedule or on
the whole-sample breastfeeding distribution. The method is outlined in Brass
and Coale (1968, pp. 127-132) and Lesthaeghe and Page (1980). The latter reference provides a model breastfeeding
schedule.

Greater depth of analysis is possible
by use of proportional hazard models relating the proportions breastfeeding at
various durations to selected background variables, or by linear regression. Proportional hazard models are introduced in a paper by McDonald
(1981). The present paper will explore
linear regression models, which should
be more familiar to readers.

When using regression models, it is
essential that the fitted estimates be
made duration-specific, since the probability of lactation is heavily dependent
on time elapsed since childbirth. Regressing breastfeeding status separately
for each duration is one option (see Figure 3), but the regression coefficients
may not be stable if sample sizes are
small. An alternative that allows samples for different intervals to be combined in a single regression is to include
the /, terms in the regressor list. That is,
for each duration we would fit a model
of the form

The left-hand side of the model is

that of sample respondents generally.

most women may be breastfeeding, and
very long ones, when most are not, the
different subgroups should display /, (n)
values close to bh, while at intermediate
durations the groups should become
more distinct. Any single model spanning all durations will be defective if this
is the case and should ideally be replaced by a series of models fitted to different regions of the /, curve. For example, separate models “might be fitted to
the part of the i distribution to the left
of the point i, = 2/3, to the region between 2/3 and Vs and to the region right
of the point i= 1/3, The durations at
which these values fall will differ from
sample to sample. (For Sri Lanka they
fall at about 16 and 28 months, respectively, and these numbers have been
used to split intervals in the regressions
that follow.)

group and educational level). This allows a few
variables to be used as controls in the regression.

RESULTS

We have tested models of the type
shown in (2) on breastfeeding information for a number of countries participating in the WFS (Smith and Ferry,
1985). Table 1 displays findings for Sri
Lanka using birth-weighted rates,
where we have selected the variables
parity group (Parity 1-2, 3-4,5 +), educational level (none, primary school,
middle school or more), residence (rural, urban migrant, lifetime urban resident), work experience since marriage
(none, work at home, work away from
home), and use of contraception since
the birth (none, traditional methods,
modern methods). (In earlier regressions age group, sex of child, and
whether additional children were
wanted following the birth were also
tested. These factors were not found
significant and have been dropped.)
There are conceptual problems with
three of the variables used. In the case of
residence, status as of interview is used.
We would rather have known the respondent’s status in the period following
the birth, which is not always the same.
Likewise, work status following the
birth is more informative than work experience in general. Finally, a determining factor in contraceptive use is the duration since the birth. Hence, an overall
regression coefficient for this variable is
less informative than coefficients for different duration periods. There is also an
interaction effect between contraceptive use, pregnancy, and lactation,
whereby contraception enables women
to breastfeed longer if they so choose.
(Though it does not follow that they will

do so.)
The table resolves two questions re
lating to contraceptive use. First, con
Breastfeeding in Sri Lanka 95

traception is not found to influence net
breastfeeding rates in the interval
(1,16), although it is about as prevalent
as in later intervals (36 per cent use is reported in the first interval, 39 per cent in
the second and 33 per cent in the third).
Contraception clearly contributes to
avoidance of pregnancy in periods beyond about one and a half years, as both
its general influence on breastfeeding
and that of modern methods in particular are pronounced at long durations.
The positive coefficients at intervals beyond the first also imply that contraceptive use is not a substitute for lactation in
Sri Lanka, or not a predominant one.

Among other variables, lifetime urban residence is associated with short
durations of breastfeeding, and being an
urban migrant is associated with intermediate durations, relative to those of
rural women.® The effects of residence
on breastfeeding are especially pronounced in the first interval. It is not obvious why the coefficients for migration
cease to be significant at longer durations.

By parity as by contraception, differences in breastfeeding rates are not
significant at short durations but become so with time as lower parity
women reach pregnancy. Patterns by
age are similar, but less sharp (not
shown). An association between parity
and other factors is evident in the coefficients for Parity 3-4, which are mostly

8Since the birth sample is largely rural (82 per
cent), we have regressed breastfeeding rates separately for births to urban women to check that the
effects of other factors are similar for the two residential areas. Coefficients for the factors shown in
the table were found to differ, as did levels of
significance, but the direction of association was
the same in every case in the single-period regression and usually the same in the three subperiods.

negative in the single-attribute rates (—
0.008 overall, and +0.007, —0.007, —
0.018 in the three sub-intervals), but
positive in the multiple regression. Evidently because of interactions with
other variables, signs also change for
primary education.

Finally, we note that middle school
attendance and work at home are both
strongly associated with lactation behavior, the former negatively and the
latter to about an equal degree positively. The difference is partly between
income groups, those with middle
schooling or more tending to have
higher family incomes and not to work,
and those working at home tending to
be less-educated and poor. Working
outside the home seems not to influence
breastfeeding to any great extent.

The effects of the various factors are
displayed in greater detail in Figure 3,
which shows regression coefficients separately for each interval, using interval
widths of three months to avoid extremely small sample sizes. The sample

will be seen to be close, the instability of

can be interpreted as linear distances between the overall proportion breastfeeding at each duration and the proportions breastfeeding in the different
subgroups and in the idealized figure become lines parallel to the general curve.
The areas between these lines, which
are the regression coefficients times the
interval widths, correspond to the differences between the whole-sample and
subgroup means.

The point is illustrated in Figure 4 for
rural and urban breastfeeding rates. In
the interval (0, 16) the regression coefficients for residence are rural
= +0.025 and urban = —0.135. These
are entered in the figure as the distances
ab and af separating the rural (bc) and
urban (fe) rates from the idealized
whole-sample rate (ad). The areas
abcd =16 + (—0.025) = 0.4 months and
adef = 16+ (—0.135) = —2.2 months
will be seen to be close to the actual rural
and urban differences for this segment
of the curve. Adding the increments for
later durations produces the whole period estimates fig surat = & + 0.9
months, fireg urban = & — 4.5 months.
These figures agree with the actual differences.

Table 1 displays differences associated with other factors. In the multiple
attribute regressions, middle schooling
depresses breastfeeding durations about
as strongly as lifetime urban residence
relative to women who are rural and uneducated. Being at Parity 5 or above or
working at home almost as sharply increases durations. The use of contraception has slightly smaller positive effects.

The patterns suggest that as Sri
Lanka women become increasingly well
educated and urban, and as family sizes
decline, durations of breastfeeding will
become shorter. Equally important

Breastfeeding in Sri Lanka 99

however, even among better-educated
urban wives, breastfeeding continues
longer than is typical of Western countries. In the circumstance, it is possible
that the virtual abandonment of breastfeeding that for a time characterized the
United States will be avoided.

As a final check on the quality of the
regression procedure and of these findings, we have fitted the Sri Lanka data
using the proportional hazards model:

h(n) = Fexp{ bx, ] (4)

where i, (n) is a regression estimate of
the sample proportion breastfeeding at
duration y among women with the set of
attributes x,, /, is the proportion breastfeeding at duration y among women
comprising the base category of Table 1;
and b is the vector of regression coefficients. The model was fitted using the
GLIM package (Baker and Nelder,
1978; see also McDonald, 1981, for a detailed introduction to our use of the proportional hazards model with breastfeeding data, and Menken et al, 1981,
for an application to marriage dissolution rates). Because of the limited capacity of the WFS computer, 3-month
rather than single-month intervals were
used. The ordinary least squares model
used was that of Expression (2) and was
also for 3-month intervals.

Table 2 displays the increment to the
mean duration of breastfeeding associated with each regressor variable, and
the ratio of the regression coefficient to
its standard error for both the OLS and
proportional hazards fittings. |

Overall differences will be seen to be
relatively small, and in only one case

“ Estimates are from single regressioins for ¢ = 48 months, with interval widths of 3 months. Table 1 used interval! widths of 1
month, which produce slightly different regression coefficients and estimated mean breastfeeding durations.

considered significant in one model and
not the other on the basis of its confidence interval. A similar agreement
between current status and proportional
hazards models is reported in Anderson, et al. (1984). The agreement can be
understood by noting that the current
status model and also the Brass (United
Nations, 1983) relational Gompertz fertility model are derived by taking a complementary log-log transform of the proportional hazards model. To a close
approximation, the dependent variable
in the transformed equation is a linear
function of /,, permitting substitution of
the P*, ; variable for terms in /n(—In 1).
An important consequence of the near
linearity of the transform is that proportional hazards coefficients can be estimated from the OLS coefficients as

bi.p.H = — 3 Biors.

(The relationship between the least
squares and P-H coefficients is found
from the derivative: d/dx In(—Inx) = 1/
(x In x). The derivative at x = 0.5 is —
2.9.) |

Of the two methods, proportional
hazards modeling has the advantages of
appropriate specification of the error
Structure and restriction of estimated
j,(n) values to the range (0,1). It cannot,
however, be used to process masses of
data and large numbers of variables
quickly. Virtually every run requires the
construction of a separate data file. Ordinary least squares analysis by the
model of Expression (2) provides a
vastly more flexible approach, with little
sacrifice in analytical quality.
