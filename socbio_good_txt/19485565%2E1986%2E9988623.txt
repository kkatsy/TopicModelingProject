Another Look at the Hutterites
and Natural Fertility

ABSTRACT: The fertility of the Hutterites has become almost legendary in the demographic literature. Coale selected their overall total fertility rate (equal to 10.9) as the standard for his
index of marital fertility (Coale, 1965). The rate is very commonly used as a benchmark for
“natural fertility”; that is, as an indicator of how high human procreation can be under favorable environmental conditions and with no deliberate controls.

The present note takes off from the interesting but unexplored fact that while the Hutterite
TFR of 10.9 is high relative to most other extant populations, this rate does not, in fact, represent a maximum biological potential TFR. In other words, some controls do seem to be at work
even among the Hutterites. The purpose of this exercise is two-fold: (1) We estimate a modified
figure for what Hutterite fertility could be under a truly unconstrained regime and present a
revised age pattern of that fertility; (2) We compare this modified Hutterite age-specific fertilityrate pattern to the “natural fertility” age-specific fertility-rate pattern and look at some broader
implications.

aged 35—49 were currently married, widowhood seems unimportant as a factor
in fertility per ever-married women.

About 5 per cent of the total births recalled by the women were children reported to have died before reaching
their first birthday. This is a relatively
high figure but covers, it should be recalled, pregnancies going back several
decades before 1950, the date of the first
survey. It was also reported that most
deliveries took place at home with only a
midwife in attention. Pregnancy wastage (fetal deaths due to spontaneous
abortions and miscarriage) was reported
(in a later follow-up study) to be about
10 per cent of all pregnancies. Women
typically nursed their infants, but some
dietary supplements were usually introduced after six months and most infants
were weaned by the end of their first
year.

Coital frequency was estimated at 2.5
per week for young couples, and there
was evidence that it declined with family
size and age. Separation of couples,
even temporarily, was thought to be
rare. There was no positive injunction to
lead couples to continue to pursue maximum fertility, and abstinence was not
looked upon as a “sin.” Young couples
who remained childless were an oddity
attracting solicitude or curiosity. However, couples who, having six or eight
children, had no more, were not viewed
as strange. The Eaton and Mayer study
found some clinical evidence that a substantial number of women over 35 had
been surgically sterilized, as a result of
hysterectomies and other abdominal operations.

Table 1 presents the Hutterite marital age-specific fertility rates. Focusing
on the completed family size of females
aged 45-49, we find a total fertility rate
(TFR) of 10.9. (Lower figures are

yielded for females aged 50-54 and
over, but recall problems are common
in such data, particularly when some of
the children have died.) It is this TFR of
nearly 11 which has established the Hutterites’ place in the demographic literature.

The Hutterite TFR and the agespecific rates underlying it are usually
presented as an illustration of how high
fertility can be when a population is
healthy, stable, and noncontracepting.
Could it be higher still? In their original
work, Eaton and Mayer addressed the
question of what Hutterite fertility
could be if all females married early and
were never widowed, thus gaining additional exposure time. They estimated
rather roughly that completed family
size (total fertility) could be increased
by between 1 and 3 births, to between 12
and 14 births per woman.

BIRTH INTERVALS
BY PARITY

In separate biostatistical studies,
Tietze (1957) and Sheps (1965) have ex

amined the Hutterite data in depth. The
birth intervals by parity resulting from
the fertility rates derived by Sheps are
shown in Table 2. The pattern shows a
gradual increase in the mean birth interval from 19 months for Parity 2 to 25
months for Parity 14, an increase of
roughly half a month per additional
birth. What explains this increase in
mean interval?

(a) The mean time from marriage to
first birth is about 14 months, resulting
in an estimate of 5 months ‘“‘waiting
time” to conceive (since there is no premarital pregnancy). This can be taken to
be the minimum “waiting time”’ needed
to conceive for higher parities as well.
(b) There is a normal period of postpartum amenorrhea (and infecundity) of
several months. (c) Fetal wastage
lengthens the mean intervals, and
Sheps, after adjusting the reported rates

.of fetal wastage in this population, sets
_ this effect as one month added per mean
. interval. Both these last two factors are

probably age-parity connected and
would be more important for higher
parity births than lower parity ones
(Leridon, 1977; Henry, 1972; Bongaarts, 1975; Gorsh and Wolfers, 1979;
Pearl, 1936). Thus, we assume that postpartum amenorrhea varies from 1 to 3
months between Parities 2 and 14; and
that the fetal wastage effect varies from
0 to 2 months over the same parity
range. (d) Lactation affects the length of
post-partum amenorrhea. If, following
Bongaarts’ (1978) estimate, we allow
roughly one month of “protection” per
two months of intense lactation, then six
months of breast-feeding creates three
months of. post-partum amenorrhea.
This period overlaps the normal period
of post-partum amenorrhea and thus
adds a net period of protection from two
months for Parity 2 to zero months for

Hutterites and Natural Fertility 67

Parity 14. (This lactation effect is modest enough to warrant ignoring the possible effect of infant mortality in reducing the average lactational period.)

What remains, then, is the “unexplained” increase in mean birth interval
as parity increases, after all these factors
(usual waiting time to conceive, postpartum amenorrhea, fetal wastage and
lactation) have been taken into account.
This period is two months for Parity 2,
rising to six months for Parity 7 and remaining constant through Parity 14. Table 2 presents the numerical outcome of
this exercise.

BIRTH INTERVALS
BY AGE OF MOTHER

These data on mean interval by parity can be converted into mean interval
by age, the intervals resulting from the
age-specific marital fertility rate presented in Table 1. These are shown in
Table 3. They also show a gradual increase up to age groups 40-44 where the
fertility rate falls sharply and the intervals rise abruptly. If we focus on the first
four mean intervals of the Hutterite agespecific fertility span, we can attempt
the same kind of decomposition of the
mean interval undertaken above by parity. As may be seen in Table 3, age
group 20-24 produced 2.8 births, and a
mean interval of 21 months. If we assume (a) a nine-month pregnancy, (b)
one month of normal post-partum
amenorrhea, (c) three months of lactational amenorrhea, (d) a normal waiting
time of five months, then we have accounted for 18 months. The same logic
underlies the calculation of the estimated minimum intervals for agegroups 25-29 and above.

EXPLANATORY FACTORS

What remains when all these factors
are allowed for is the “unexplained”’ residual. For age group 20~24 this can perhaps be due to a slightly longer amenorrheal period (normal plus factational),
or higher fetal wastage, or variation in
the normal waiting time, or some combination of all these factors. However,
for the age groups 25-29, 30~34, and 35—
39, slight changes in these explanatory
factors will not suffice to explain the increasing unexplained portion of the interval. What other factors can explain
this increase in mean birth interval with
age? Only two factors would appear to
remain: (a) declining fecundability with
age; (b) contraception, including sterilization and reduced coital frequency.

The issue of what exactly is meant (or
ought to be meant) by “‘declining fecundability” is a complex one.? As noted,
primary sterility among Hutterite
women seems low (3 per cent of the
married women aged 35-39 had no children). Sterility does increase with age
(Pittinger, 1973),° and this must also be
allowed for. But Sheps (1965) found no

*Peluso (1976, p. 35) writes: “The reduced reproductive capacity associated with increasing maternalageis. . . . aresult of increased incidence of
spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations. . . .” Thisis consistent with the growing evidence that many early miscarriages escape notice
(Sheps, 1965, p. 112). As a result, the distinction
between fecundability and fetal wastage is almost
impossible to draw.

3But, Henry (1972, p. 19) writes: “From available information on the mean interval between
marriage and birth by the woman’s age, there does
not appear to be a reduction with increasing
age... .”” Charbonneau (1975, p. 208) puts the
same point even more clearly: ‘“‘Retenons pour
Jinstant qu’entre 17 ans et 40 ans, c’est-a-dire
durant Ja plus grande partie de la vie feconde des
femmes, I’dge de la femme considere isolement
n’a pas d’influence sur la fecondite des couples fertiles.” Thus, what is called declining fecundability
may well be a composite of many forces.

evidence of a particularly sharp decline
in fecundability with age among the
Hutterites. Hence, the average incidence by age of sterility (for European
populations) presented by Henry (1961)
is perhaps a reasonable estimate of the
incidence of sterility by age for the Hutterites. Interpolating between the
benchmark estimates Henry gives for
ages 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40, we estimate
the following increments to the mean
birth interval for all women of a given
age group by reason of the fact that a
growing proportion of their number are
sterile and consequently not making any
contribution to the flow of births:

Ages 20-24—1.0 months
Ages 25-29—2.0 months
Ages 30-34—3.0 months
Ages 35-39—4.0 months
Ages 40-44—10.0 months

If we make this adjustment to the estimated interval of Table 3, the results
are as shown in Table 4.

The unexplained discrepancies between the estimated mean intervals and
the observed intervals are reduced but
not eliminated. We are, therefore,
forced to conclude that some other
fertility-inhibiting control was at work in
the Hutterite population and that this

control was age-parity connected. Thus,
there is this analytical evidence to go
with the qualitative empirical evidence
reported by Eaton and Mayer (1954)
that some age- and parity-connected
controls seemed to be present in this
natural fertility population. Eaton and
Mayer (1954) suggested some sterilization and also declining coital frequency
as the principal such controls.

THE POTENTIAL “FULL
FERTILITY” OF THE
HUTTERITES

Accepting these adjusted minimum
birth intervals of Table 3, we can also
calculate the maximum potential “full
fertility” of the Hutterites were these estimated minimum intervals attained.
These are shown in Table 5. They represent, to repeat, the estimated mean
birth intervals by age group allowing for
(a) pregnancy itself, (6) postpartum
amenorrhea, (c) fetal losses; (d@) normal
waiting time, and (e) increasing sterility.

Vol. 33, No. 1-2

The resulting age-specific rate and
the total fertility rate implied can be
called the “‘full fertility” of the Hutterites. They represent a total fertility rate
of about 15, a figure which is in line with
other analytically-based estimates of
maximum fertility (Bongaarts, 1978).
Indeed, since the original Hutterite
study, Charbonneau has reported on a
historical French Canadian population
with a total fertility rate nearly this high
(Charbonneau, 1975).

CONCLUSIONS ON HUTTERITE
FERTILITY

Thus, the proper conclusion about
Hutterite fertility should perhaps be
that a population which marries relatively late and has some lactational
amenorrhea and some high-parity—
connected birth-preventing practices
can produce 11 live births per married
female. Were this population to marry
early, have no lactational amenorrhea,
and no sterilization or parity-connected
decline in coitus, then the observed
mean birth intervals would be reduced
slightly, and the total fertility rate would
be about 15.0 per woman. The “natural
fertility” of the Hutterites is still well below what may be called to borrow
Henripin’s phrase (1954), the potential
“full fertility.”

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
NATURAL FERTILITY MODEL

Let us conclude by comparing this
“full fertility” to the familiar “natural
fertility” as defined by Henry and formalized by Coale and Trussell (1974).
The Coale-Trussell “natural fertility’
model describes the following situation:

Er(a) = MEn(a) e™’(a)

The proportion of the female population married (or otherwise in union) and
the environmental and societal factors
affect only M. Where no contraception
is practiced, m = 0 and the age pattern
of fertility corresponds to the natural
fertility pattern. Coale has developed at
some length in earlier works (Coale,
1971) the importance of differences in
proportion married in explaining
changes in total fertility over time. However, these changes in marriage patterns
do not seem to affect very much the agespecific pattern of fertility within marriage. Hence, the M factor is simply a
scalar which raises or lowers the curve
but does not affect its shape. The natural
fertility model also assumes that the environmental-societal factors can be
treated the same way. They affect total
fertility evenly across the fecund agespan; that is, they affect average birth
interval, are not parity connected, and
do not represent conscious ‘‘control.”
Control occurs (77 >0) when the shape
of the actual fertility curve differs from
the shape of the natural fertility curve.
Indeed, such a difference is prima facia
evidence of the existence of contraception in this model.

“Natural fertility” is subject to variation in real populations. D’Souza (1974)

72 Robinson

writes, for example: ‘The existence of
differences in levels of natural fertility is
well known.” He derives “‘standardized” parameters for the major components involved in the closed birth intervals (ages 20-45). He notes:

In a non-contraceptive situation of very
low foetal wastage . . . the S [standardized] mean time to conceive a live birth
would perhaps be close enough to the actual mean time to conception of a live
birth. But, even in this case the two are
not the same, since many imponderables
are present in a concrete situation, like
frequency of intercourse, taboos, absences, sickness, etc., all of which are included in Henry’s definition of ‘natural
fertility’. . . . If we include the possibility
of high foetal wastage .. . the situation
becomes more complex. Not only do we
have in this case an increase in the mean
time to conception ofa live birth, but also
. . . because of incomplete gestation. . .
the month or so after miscarriage before
the woman becomes fecundable again
(pp. 117-118).

In a similar vein, Potter (1979) has
proposed three separate “‘natural fertility” standards, according to the level of
spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and
lactational practice. For age group 2024 these vary from the “high” fertility
mean interval of 20 months to a “low”
fertility mean interval of 34 months. His
“intermediate” fertility interval of 27
months coincides with the Coale-Trusell
(1974) natural fertility schedule.

Evidently several levels of “natural
fertility” can be defined depending upon
the force of: (a) lactational amenorrhea;
(b) fetal wastage; (c) factors affecting
cohabitation and frequency of intercourse. A useful analytical step would
appear to be served by defining the maximum ‘full fertility’ potential which
would be reached in any population
when such controls are minimal or ab

sent altogether. This our “full fertility”
curve does.

In Figure 1 we plot the estimated
Hutterite ‘‘full fertility” curve (the solid
line) against the “natural fertility” curve
of Coale and Trussell (1974) (the dotted
line) and show both as normalized rates
(adding to 100). The Coale and Trussell
rates are an average of 7 of Henry’s
“natural fertility” populations, including the Hutterites. Both of the schedules
plotted are empirically based but both
are also, in a sense, “models” or constructs. (The data are shown in Table 6.)

The fact that our ‘‘full fertility”
model curve is above the “natural fertility” model is not surprising. We have removed the various controls present even
in the “natural fertility” setting, and this
leads to the difference between
TFR = 15.0 and TFR = 11.0. But what
explains the difference in the shape of
our “‘full fertility’? schedule and the
Coale-Trussell “natural fertility” schedule?

The answer lies in the assumption
made by Henry and accepted by Coale
and Trussell that none of the controls
present in a natural fertility situation are
parity-connected. In other words, they
assume that removing all such controls
would change the level but not the shape
of their curve. Our analytical exercise
casts doubt on the validity of this assumption.

At one point Coale and Trussell write
of “the gradual decline with age characteristic of natural fertility” (Coale and
Trussell, 1974, p. 190), but do not elaborate on why this decline occurs. Our
results suggest that increasing sterility,
fetal losses, and other physiological factors are insufficient to explain the sharp
age-parity-connected decline in fertility
shown by their curve. What is left are
the “‘other” controls, societal and indi

vidual, which are always present even in
a ‘natural fertility” setting. These other
factors include the numerous customs,
taboos, and behavior patterns, most of
which end up affecting coital frequency
(Davis and Blake, 1959; Henry, 1961).
Coital frequency becomes the only plausible parity-connected control in a natural fertility setting.

Coital frequency evidently does decline with age, although we know very
little about why (Pearl, 1936; Tietze,
1960). Possible explanations are: declining libido (male and/or female); increased separation of spouses; increased
morbidity and infirmity of one partner;
and a desire to have no more children,
either because of taboos on births past a
certain life cycle point (the birth of one’s
grandchildren) or individual choice. Coital frequency may or may not be a deliberate birth-preventing practice.
Clearly, it is a relatively complex variable and an almost completely neglected
one. Both societal and individual preferences regarding fertility are involved.

One final point can be made. It is not
clear why all other controls, including
coital frequency, should be parityneutral. The natural fertility model operates with an implicit theory of fertility
which says that couples in high-fertility
populations may use “spacing” tactics
but not “stopping” tactics, and that societal controls, if present, also work this
way. Yet there is considerable empirical
support for thinking that some threshold
of family size does exist for most couples
which triggers efforts to reduce subsequent fertility. Under such conditions,
whatever “stopping” procedures are
available will be used in a parityconnected way. Indeed, it has long been
accepted that much of the decline in fer
 

Social Biology

tility in the Western “transition”? was
based on “folk” not “appliance” methods of contraception (abstinence and
withdrawal included) and began to occur very early (Stix, 1940; Nag, 1980).
Many of the societal rules and taboos
discussed by Henry clearly also can be
seen as “‘stopping”’ procedures.

Our conclusion is that the declining
age-specific “natural fertility” curve
must be seen as a composite result of
partly physiological elements but also
partly behavioral factors. The “natural
fertility” model assumes that these behavioral factors, including declining coital frequency, are parity-neutral but the
results of our analytical exercise question this.

In criticizing some recent writers who
propose explaining all presently unexplained variation in fertility as due to nutrition, Menken wrote:

To probe more deeply into the underlying causes of differences in fertility becomes far more difficult. . . . Evidence
on frequency of intercourse as well as
other factors which may prolong time to
conception is undoubtedly difficult to obtain... . Yet to accept nutrition as the
primary explanation of fertility differences simply because the truth is difficult
(or perhaps impossible) to discover is a
retreat to adoption of a simplistic hypothesis . . . (Menken, et al., 1980, p. 441).

Can the same not be said of “declining
biological fecundability”’? This would
seem to be an important issue in future
fertility research.
