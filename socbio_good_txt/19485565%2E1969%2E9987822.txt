Correction of a Criticism of the Handbook

of Congenital Malformations

The review of the Handbook of Congenital
Malformations (1967), edited by Alan Rubin, recently printed in Social Biology (Kaplan, 1969) includes a criticism regarding the
book’s description of Leber’s congenital
amaurosis. The disease’s etiology is described by Rubin as being autosomal recessive. The review criticized the allegation as
an oversimplification and referred to a review of the same condition in another recent
handbook (Pratt, 1967). Actually, however,
the two handbooks do of disagree with each
other on this matter. The book edited by
Rubin (1967) discusses Leber’s congenital
amaurosis and accurately states that the
disease is associated with a pair of autosomal

recessive factors; the book by Pratt (1967),
on the other hand, describes Leber’s opiic
atrophy, not congenital amaurosis.

In a personal communication, V. A. McKusick (1969) has correctly pointed out
that in my review of Rubin’s book Leber’s
congenital amaurosis was erroneously confused with Leber’s optic atrophy.

I would like to retract the erroneous
criticism included in my review of the wellorganized and useful handbook by Rubin
(1967). The error was not made by the
book’s editor, but by the reviewer. My
thanks are also due to McKusick, for having
promptly notified me of his observation of
the error.
