ABSTRACT: The study investigates the relationship between age at marriage and the length of first
birth interval in two states of India: Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. Life tables of first-birth intervals
and median first-birth intervals are computed for several subgroups of the study population.
Multivariate hazards modelling technique is used to study the net effect of age at marriage,
controlling for a multiple of socioeconomic factors. The result shows that the average first-birth
interval varies by age at marriage and is much longer in Uttar Pradesh than in Kerala.

In populations in which marriage is
nearly universal, age at marriage has a
strong influence on a variety of demographic and social phenomena. Early
and universal marriage are the two
most outstanding features of rural society in India. Quite often girls are
married at an age well before puberty.
Together with economic causes, social
considerations are important factors
perpetuating the custom of early marriage. In almost all cases, the marriage
is arranged by the parents or the guardians, and the prospective bride and
bridegroom are generally not consulted in this respect.

Marriage does not signal the beginning of cohabitation or sexual relations. It is only after the Gauna or
Rukhsat (hereafter termed return marriage [RM]) ceremony that the bride
goes to live with her husband, and the
partners enter conjugal relations. The
distinction between marriage and RM
is a critical element in what is often referred to as a “two-stage’’ marriage
process. The two-stage process always

operates in the case of childhood marriage, but it also operates quite often in
marriages that take place after menarche. Generally, RM is performed at an
age when a girl is considered physically
mature enough to become a wife although exceptions are not uncommon.
In certain rural parts of India, a custom
of frequent visits by brides during the
early years of their marriage is prevalent. After RM, brides usually stay for
a short duration with their in-laws and
then return to their parents for a considerable period. Further, they make
frequent short visits to their parents in
the following years. Older women in
the family customarily isolate younger
women from their husbands during the
initial days of marriage.

Marital customs vary by regions in
India, and India’s Kerala state presents
a different marital pattern. The custom
of return marriage is nonexistent in
Kerala. Age at marriage has been constantly rising in Kerala and is the highest in the nation for men and women.
The more years of schooling a woman

has, or the better off she is economically, the more likely she is to marry at
an older age. Caste and religion also
make a difference. Economic factors,
such as the employment of the prospective husband are key determinants
of marriage in Kerala (Zachariah,
1984). Kerala has received worldwide
attention for its unpredicted fertility
decline in recent years. Rapid fertility
Vay é <
= decline took place despite low per‘ capita income and low levels of indus8 trialization, urbanization, and nutri5 tion. The links between marriage and
2 fertility are at least superficially obvioo ous. Rising mean age at marriage and
w Tising percentages of single individuals
c, are associated with declines in mea= sures of fertility such as the birth rate.
g Women who marry late in any popusolation ultimately have fewer children
= on average. It is estimated that nearly
S 30 per cent of the overall fertility de‘6 cline in Kerala is because of an increase
in age at marriage. In Kerala, consum= mation of marriage takes place with
S the marriage, and virtually no couple
-,uses contraception before their first
@ child is born.
In societies where contraception is
s nonexistent, such as India, timing of
es the first birth is considered a measure
o Of fecundity. However, the childspacing patterns in India have not been
extensively studied. Timing of the first
birth is influenced by social factors
such as the return marriage customs in
Uttar Pradesh and biological factors
such as age at menarche (especially because of the early age at marriages) and
nutritional levels (such as the low nutritional status of Kerala population)
(Panikar, 1980).
We examine the timing of first birth
in two Indian populations (Uttar Pra

desh and Kerala) with emphasis on the
role of age at marriage. In Uttar
Pradesh, age at return marriage is considered the beginning of sexual activity, whereas in Kerala such activity begins with the marriage ceremony. The
availability of data from two time
points (1978 and 1987) from Uttar
Pradesh allows us to look at trends in
the timing of first birth in the population. Since marriage is usually associated with social and economic factors
such as religion, education, year of
marriage, and work status, this study
examines the net effect of age at marriage, controlling for these factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The basic data we use come from
three surveys. Two Uttar Pradesh surveys—Rural Development and Population Growth: A Sample Survey, and
Effect of Socio-cultural Factors on Determinants of Fertility in Eastern Uttar
Pradesh—were conducted in 1978 and
1987 under the auspices of the Centre
of Population Studies, Banaras Hindu
University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh
(UP). The third, the Kerala Fertility
Survey, was conducted in 1980 by the
Kerala State Bureau of Economics and
Statistics and the World Bank.

The objective of the UP surveys was
to study the fertility level and other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The 1978 and 1987 surveys
included all the households—3,514
from one district and 4,230 from three
districts, respectively. A couple (or
woman) was eligible if both partners
were alive on the reference dates
(March 25, 1978, and October 1,
1987), and the woman was less than
age 50. In addition to other informaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

tion, data relating to age at marriage
and RM, the interval between RM and
first birth and between consecutive
births, and age at different orders of
birth were collected for each married
female in the household.

The objective of the Kerala survey
was to examine the determinants of the
recent fertility decline in Kerala. The
study used data collected from 3,000
households selected randomly from
three districts of Kerala, chosen on the
basis of geographical location and fertility level. For every adult living in the
household, information was collected
on marriage, attitudes toward marriage, fertility history, and on a number of socioeconomic variables.

The variable of principal interest in
the study is timing of the first birth. At
the time of the survey, many women
had not given birth to their first child.
For such women, we know only that
their duration to first birth exceeds
the time elapsed from marriage to the
survey date. These observations are
known as_ censored _ observations.
Thus, the data in the present study consists of complete (for those who have
given birth) and censored (for those
who have not given birth) observations. The principal statistical methods
of analysis of such data are life table
techniques (Namboodiri and Suchindran, 1987). Life tables of first-birth intervals and median first-birth intervals
from the life tables were computed for
several subgroups of the study population. For studying the net effect of age
at marriage, controlling for a multiple
of socioeconomic factors, we use the
multivariate hazards modelling technique (Cox, 1972).

The explanatory variables we use
are listed in Table 1. To facilitate in
 

Social Biology

terpretation, in this study women were
grouped according to their age at RM
(or simply marriage) as follows: Group
I, up to 13; Group II, 14, 15, Group
III, 16, 17, 18; Group IV, 19 and
above.

The first group represents the prepuberty group, the second and third
represent early and late adolescence,
and the final group consists of women
starting sexual activity postadolescence.

RESULTS

In Table 1 we give the mean age at
RM (or marriage in the case of Kerala)
for various subgroups in the study population. The overall mean age at RM
rose by 0.9 a year from 1978 to 1987 in
UP, whereas in Kerala the overall
mean age at marriage in 1980 was a full
two years higher than the 1987 UP figure. As seen in Table 1, age at marriage varies by timing of marriage, educational status of husband and wife,
and religion. In both UP and Kerala,
age at marriage is lower when husband
and wife have less education and in
Kerala among those who married before 1970, nonworking women, and
Muslims.

In Table 2 we show the median birth
intervals and the proportion who did
not have a birth in ten years (the 1978
UP survey allows only a duration up to
98 months) calculated from the life tables of first-birth intervals for several
subgroups of the study population.
These life tables do not adjust for the
difference in age at marriage. Both in
UP and Kerala, the average time of
first birth declines when age at marriage increases from a preadolescent to
postadolescent age. The striking obser

vation from Table 2 is that in the UP
population the median first-birth interval is more than twice as long as that of
the Kerala population in every single
subgroup considered. In UP, the overs all median first birth interval varies
‘e only by 0.3 months from 1978 to 1987
5 and is 23.6 to 23.9 months greater than
© in Kerala.

The proportion of women who have
not conceived within ten years also reveals the differential timing of first
birth among the subgroups considered.
In Kerala, the proportion of women
who have not conceived within ten
years was below 3 per cent, whereas in
UP, this proportion is nearly 10 per
cent overall.

pected, the four age-at-RM groups

controlling for a number of socioeconomic factors. The relative risk of first
birth in 1978 UP was 0.38, 0.60, and
0.68 for RM groups =13, 14-15, and
16-18 compared to the group married
at 19 or after. The corresponding relative risks were nearly identical for
Kerala. However, for the 1987 UP
population the gap among the ageat-RM groups has been considerably
reduced. For this population, the
groups 14-15, 16-18, and 19 and
above show only marginal differences.

marriage) and the first birth is often
used as an index of fecundity (biological capacity to reproduce) of a population. The present analysis shows that
the average first-birth interval varies by
age at RM. The most striking result of
the study is that within each RM age
group, the UP population has nearly a
20-month longer duration than Kerala.
Although Kerala women showed a
shorter interval, even the overall mean
birth interval of 20.3 months observed
in Kerala is longer than that of many
other populations. For example, Sheps

(1965) reported that in the Hutterite
population the average first-birth interval is only 11.2 months. The mean firstbirth intervals of the UP population
are much higher than what is observed
in Western countries as well as in many
developing countries, but are consistent with studies conducted in Northern India (Bhattacharya and Singh,
1983) as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh (Hobcraft and McDonald, 1984).
It is interesting to examine some of
the reasons for these wide disparities
among different populations.

In Uttar Pradesh, besides other factors, one or more of the following may
be responsible for the observed trend
in the average delay in the first-birth
interval according to age at RM and
the length of first-birth interval:

(1) The joint family system is prevalent in rural areas. Marriages are usually
arranged by parents or elderly members
of the household. Thus a couple starts
their conjugal life in a joint family, only
in later years becoming self-supporting
and separating from the parental household. In joint families, couples get fewer
chances of coition because of less privacy and more observance of rigid intercourse taboos.

(2) The probability of fetal death ts
rather high for females in their early adolescence and gradually declines until
the age of 20. Information on fetal loss
is not available in this study.

(3) The custom of frequent visits to
parents in the early years of RM is even
more frequent for brides marrying at
younger ages.

(4) Some females attain menarche
during the period of observation.

(5) The incidence of the adolescent
subfecundity period defined by Henry
(1966) as “‘a variable period of complete
sterility after puberty or by a progressive
increase in fecundability up to maturity”
may be high in the population.

The factors listed above may affect
the Kerala population, especially the
very young age groups, except that in
Kerala couples usually live together
after marriage. However, even in the
oldest age groups (19 and above), the
observed median birth interval is quite
long. Sheps (1965) noted that the Hutterite population has high levels of
health and nutrition, which may be responsible for their high fecundability
and consequently short birth interval.
The level of nutrition in Kerala is relatively low compared to Western standards. The role of nutrition factors in
the Uttar Pradesh population also
needs to be considered.

It is difficult to identify the inability
of a couple to procreate, because sterility is only suspected if, in the absence
of deliberate efforts to control fertility,
a woman is unable to have any recognizable conception during a sufficiently
long period after marriage. Here, estimates of the proportion of primarily
sterile couples are obtained according
to different age-at-RM groups from the
calculated life tables. The proportion
of females who have not given birth
within ten years in age-at-RM groups
appears in Table 2. The estimate of the

proportion of females not having a
birth within ten years is higher for ageat-RM Group I for both states because
here we are observing females for up to
120 months (98 months in case of 1978
data) only, and if the observations are
continued, some more will conceive.
Several factors may be responsible for
the slight increase in this proportion in
age-at-RM Group IV. Rising age at
marriage may make conception difficult. However, in UP, age at marriage
is high in the upper castes, where the
joint family system, level of education,
migration of men to urban areas for
employment, et cetera, are more prevalent. Thus a significant proportion of
husbands of women in age-at-RM
Group IV may be either students or in
search of employment, delaying conception for a considerable period.

A number of studies have shown
that the proportion of primarily sterile
couples in India lies roughly between
2.4 and 10.5 per cent. Primary sterility
is also found in Western countries,
where the smallest value of age-specific
percentages of couple sterility lies be
Social Biology

tween 2 and 8. Based on data of the
present survey for Uttar Pradesh and
other surveys conducted in the same
locality by S. N. Singh and his associates, estimates are that about 6 per
cent of couples are primarily sterile
(Bhattacharya and Singh, 1984; Bhattacharya et al., 1988). Thus, the estimates obtained for females of ageat-RM Groups II and III may be
considered to be closer to true value.
The low values of the proportion primarily sterile shows that most Indian
women eventually conceive, but time
to a live birth conception is on average,
longer than in Western societies.
