ABSTRACT: The data presented here are part of an on-going longitudinal study of the relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality in the major metropolitan centers of Ohio. Using a Standardized Mortality Ratio, we find that mortality in the seven-city urban aggregate exceeds that of the rest of the state by 39 per cent for the nonwhite population and only 1 per cent
for the white population. Further, for the nonwhite population, living in a high income area has
no discernible health benefit for nonwhites as compared to whites. On the other hand, for the
AIDS virus, there is a clear inverse association between economic status and mortality from
AIDS. It is clear that the interrelationship among race, economic status, and health continues to

be a complex one on which further research is needed.

One of the most dramatic developments in health during the present century has been the largely successful conquest of the major infectious diseases that
once ranked as the major causes of death.
Progress in the control of infectious diseases was initially attributed to improved
environmental sanitation measures that
led to a sharp reduction in the incidence
of such diseases; and these preventive
measures were subsequently augmented
by the development of effective therapeutic agents, such as penicillin, that significantly enhanced our ability to cure such
diseases. However, despite major progress in these areas, infectious diseases
continue to represent a serious public
health problem in our society (Curson,
1989). On the one hand, this problem is
due to the persistence of older diseases,
such as influenza and tuberculosis; on the
other hand it is due to the emergence of

148

entirely new diseases, most notably the
HIV virus.

Not only have infectious diseases continued to represent a serious health problem, but also there is evidence to indicate
that infectious disease mortality has been
increasing in recent years (Garrett, 1994).
To illustrate, the overall death rate from infectious causes in the United States increased by 58 per cent between 1980 and
1992 (Pinner et al., 1996). A number of
factors have been cited to explain this increase. Population aging, for example, has
contributed to the rise in the death rate
from infectious respiratory diseases;
whereas the spread of the AIDS virus reflects behavior patterns relating to sexual
contacts and intravenous drug use (Heyward and Curran, 1988). Another factor that
may be cited as contributing to this problem
relates to the relatively stagnant economy
of recent years and the exacerbation of

poverty in American society. In Ohio, to
illustrate, median family income in constant dollars rose by only 3 per cent during the 1980-90 decade, during which
time the state’s poverty rate rose from 10
to 12 per cent (Stockwell et al., 1994),
The relevance of these trends with respect
to infectious disease mortality and its recent upward trend are much more characferistic of low income ethnic minority
cpopulations (Curson, 1989, p. 164-65;
“Pinner et al., 1996, p. 191). The latter, ac© . .

ording to Curson (p. 163), experience

Goza, 1995), has focused on infant mortality. Presently we are in the midst of a
major expansion of our data base to include adult mortality and so far have created a basic data file covering the three
years centering on the 1990 census. As in
our original infant mortality research, the
basic relationship between cause-specific

status is examined within an ecological

framework in which the primary analytica] unit is the census tract in which the
decedent usually resided. The independent
variable has been defined as the percentage of low income families in each census
tract at the time of the decennial census.
The low income cut-off point, defined
as roughly 50 per cent of the median family income in metropolitan Ohio, was
$15,000. The dependent variable data consist of counts of the number of deaths by
age, race, and cause-of-death, occurring in
each census tract during the three years
1989-91. Such data have been extracted
for seven metropolitan centers in Ohio:
Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus,
Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown.

For purposes of the present research,
we are defining the adult population as
persons 20 years of age or over primarily
because there are so few deaths at ages
below 20 that including them would introduce a potential problem of rate insta- bility at these ages. Thus, the mortality
measures presented in the accompanying
tables are based on deaths and population
at ages 20 and over.

Although we eventually plan to undertake more sophisticated multivariate analyses based on individual tract data, our
work to date has been limited to a social
area type of analysis in which mortality
measures have been calculated for broad
combinations of census tracts. Specifically, we used the family income measure
to aggregate the census tracts of the seven
study cities into four broad income areas
so that approximately 25 per cent of the
tracts fell into each area.

In order to measure the association between area economic status and mortality
we have employed a technique known as
a Standardized Morality Ratio, or SMR
(Shryock and Siegel et al., 1976, p. 233Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

150 Brief Reports

234). This technique seeks to eliminate
the effects of area differences in age composition by estimating the number of
deaths that would have occurred in any
income area if the population of that area
had experienced the age-specific death
rates prevailing in a “Standard Population” (in this case the total population of
the state). For each area, the SMR is then
calculated as 100 times the ratio of the
actually observed number of deaths to the
estimated number. As such, the SMR
measures the extent to which the mortality of a given area deviates from the overall state level which is indexed at 100. An
SMR greater than 100 indicates a level of
mortality that is in excess of the overall
state level, whereas an SMR of less than
100 indicates a mortality level that is below that of the total population.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents the Standardized Mortality Ratios, by race, for all causes of
death in the study population. The first
conclusion to be drawn from these data is
that the relative level of mortality is notably higher in the urban aggregate than in
the state as a whole. For the total population, the overall SMR of 111 indicates
that, with the state level indexed at 100,
the mortality level of the seven-city aggregate exceeds that of the state by 11 per
cent. Since the urban population has a
disproportionate share of the low-income
high-risk population, this finding is not
surprising. Note, for example, that the urban excess is fairly large for the nonwhite
population (39 per cent) but is negligible
for the white population (1 per cent). The
second conclusion pertains to the nature
of the relationship between mortality levels and socioeconomic status. For the to

tal population, and for whites, there is a
very clear and strong inverse association
between SMR levels and neighborhood
economic status. For nonwhites, however,
there is a general U-shaped relationship
with the highest economic area having
the highest mortality level. This nonwhite
pattern is similar to that observed in our
earlier research on infant mortality
(Stockwell and Goza, 1996) and can be
taken as further evidence that living in a
high income area has no discernible
health benefit for nonwhites as compared
to the white population.

Similar conclusions can be drawn concerming the racial differences in the relationship between economic status and
mortality levels from the major infectious
causes of death (see Table 2). Except for
pneumonia and influenza, where the white
SMR is 5 per cent below the overall state
level, infectious disease mortality tends
to be higher in the urban aggregate than
in the general population. Moreover, for
both infectious and parasitic diseases and
pneumonia and influenza, there is a clear
and very strong inverse association between SMR levels and economic status
for the white population, but for nonwhites there is again a general U-shaped
pattern.

A decidedly different conclusion can be
drawn from Table 3 which presents the
SMR’s for the human immunodeficiency
virus. Once again the incidence of AIDS
mortality is notably higher in the sevencity urban aggregate than in the state as a
whole; but in this case both whites and
nonwhites are characterized by a pronounced inverse relationship between
SMR levels and economic status. Thus,
while nonwhites may not benefit generally
from living in higher status neighborhoods,
it is clear that the kinds of risk-taking

(inverse for whites, U-shaped for nonwhites) would suggest that racial differences in health care may be important determining factors, and that simply having
a higher economic status is not sufficient
to guarantee nonwhites the same access
to health care as whites. On the other
hand, the existence of a clear inverse as

sociation between economic status and
the AIDS virus for both whites and nonwhites would lend some support to the
social causation explanation. In any case,
it is clear that the interrelationship among
race, economic status, and health continues to be a very complex one on which
further research is needed.
