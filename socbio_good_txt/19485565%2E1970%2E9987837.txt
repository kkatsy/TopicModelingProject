Heterosis in Man: Growth in Offspring and
Distance Between Parents’ Birthplaces

When the conditioning of development is
mentioned, genetic determinants and external environmental factors usually come to
mind. Also, the role of certain factors, for
which the name “paragenetic factors” has
been proposed (Charzewska and Wolanski,
1964; Wolanski, 1967) is often mentioned.
However, within the framework of the
genetic conditioning of human development,
as opposed to plant or animal breeding, too
little importance is attributed to investigations on the effects of breeding. Even when
investigating the effects of inbreeding—to
which much attention has been devoted,—
it is often forgotten that the other side of the
coin is the effect of crossbreeding. Crossbreeding may appear as augmentation of
growth, so-called “high hybrid vigor” or
heterosis. It may also have an effect contrary to heterosis, that is, depression of
growth. When crossbreeding is viewed as
disadvantageous in some structure, inbreeding is then considered favorable and may be
called “homosis.”

However, this latter problem has remained nearly unknown in man, apart from
disadvantageous effects of “crossing”? in
connection with serological incompatibility.

In other traits, heterosis was implicated

as far back as the first decade of the current
century. Dahlberg (1943) was the first to
interpret the secular-trend mechanism as a
product of this phenomenon. Also, in our
earlier investigations we pointed out the
role of heterosis in the secular trend, quoting
three groups of mechanisms inducing the
trend (Wolanski, 1967a, 5).

In the present report we should like to
treat in greater detail both the theoretical
and statistical evidence for the indirect influence of migration (genetic flow) on the
direction and intensity of the secular trend.
This problem is of particular significance in
Poland where, after World War II, some
twelve million people were resettled. This
movement was also accompanied by additional internal migrations over shorter
distances. In Szczecin, for instance, these
processes brought about the exchange of
97% of the population; in other areas, such
as in villages of central and southern Poland,
they amounted to only a few per cent
(Kosifski and Maryahski, 1968), and often
involved more emigration than immigration.

In the present study we are primarily
interested in continuously distributed quantitative traits. As we know, these traits are
genetically determined by a great number of

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

2 Wolanski, Jarosz, Pyzuk

cooperating genes exerting a weak effect.
Genes of this type are susceptible to mutations, but the effects of the mutations are
often not easily discernible. There is, however, a higher degree of consanguinity (inbreeding coefficient) where there are small
populations, and populations which are to
some extent isolated. Thus, there is greater
opportunity for the meeting of blood relatives in any given marriage, and, hence, for
the same homologous pair of genes in corresponding loci. This occurrence may cause
higher mortality, the appearance of congenital malformations, and the like. Another
effect of inbreeding may be weakening of
biological vigor in such populations and a
decrease in fertility (Tanaka, Yanase, and
Furusho, 1964). It might also simply reduce,
or alter, the expression of some traits, and
not only those conditioned by recessive
genes (Penrose, 1955; Hulse, 1957).

Crossbreeding has an effect contrary to
the one described above: The diminution of
the chance of occurrence of homologous
genes and the prevalence of allelic sets in
various pairs of loci diminishes the number
of deaths brought about by the presence of
recessive semi-lethal genes and the number
of congenital malformations. Such effects
are well known from an abundant literature,
and in Poland we noted them recently in
connection with the secular trend (Wolahski, 1967¢). Heterosis is one of the possible
effects of crossbreeding.

Of course, the more intense the migration
(genetic flow) occurring in a given region,
the more strongly the effect of crossbreeding
can appear in the population as a whole, as
we pointed out in the interpretation of the
growth of body height in Szczecin children
(Miesowicz, 1964; Wolanski, 1967c).

In the present study we are interested in
a more detailed investigation of this phenomenon, not only as a population effect,
but also as a result of family investigations
carried out on some 1,500 families in Szczecin,

Social Biology

MATERIAL AND METHOD

The measurements were carried out by
universally applied anthropometric methods
(Martin-Saller, 1957) and statistical tests
(Guilford, 1960).

The field investigations were carried out
by the authors of the present study in November, 1966. The measurements were
made only in the morning hours; the interview data were collected in the afternoon
hours, with the parents of the children
examined being summoned to the given
schools or kindergartens. Reliable data were
obtained for 850 boys and 950 girls, residents
of Szczecin, aged 4, 8, and 16 years (within
+1.5 months of their birthdays), and from
their parents.

Between 1950 and 1960 the emigration
coefficient in Szczecin province was 18.6
and that of immigration, 26.0 (Statistical
Annual of the Polish Central Statistical
Office, 1966).

Cavalli-Sforza, Kimura, and Barrai
(1966) pointed out the extent to which
distance exerted an effect on the frequency
of marriages contracted by persons inhabiting various localities in Parma, and Malécot
(1948, 1955) showed mathematically the
presence of differences in the degree of inbreeding according to the distance between
the birthplaces of parents. Thus we distributed the families into groups according
to the distance between the birthplaces of
the mother and father of each child studied.

In the materials quoted from Parma,
60% of the marriages exhibited distances of
parental birthplaces up to 1.5 km., 75% up
to 13 km., and 90% to 35 km. In our material from Szczecin, nearly 60% of the
marriages were in the category of a distance
of up to 300 km. between the birthplaces of
the husband and wife. This obviously results from the fact that the above-mentioned migrations occurred in Poland in an
area extending nearly 1,000 km}

degree of migration: Index = No-10/MNioi-z, in

Vo]. 17, No. J

The division into groups with various
distances between the birthplace of the
father and that of the mother was made according to the probable degree of contacts
of potential spouses. A distance of 0 to 10
km. corresponds to frequent contacts of
the inhabitants of a rural community, a
large village, or a small town; distances of
11-50 km. correspond to somewhat less
frequent contacts of inhabitants of one

environments in normal social conditions,
both from the demographic and the cultural
point of view and also from the genetic point
of view, suggesting separate gene pools. We
subdivided this latter group into two groups,
one of 101 to 300 km. and one of 301 km.
and over, because of the unusual migration
in Szczecin after World War II. More than
40% of the marriages fell within this most
distant group (Table 1).

RESULTS

DEMOGRAPHIC AND BIOLOGICAL
CHARACTERISTICS

During the twelve years (1950-62) of the
births of children investigated, marriages
were increasingly between persons whose
places of birth were distant from each other
(see Table 1). It follows that the process of
crossbreeding and biological integration has
been systematically advancing in Szczecin.
Thus, among parents of children born in
Szczecin in 1950 we find 41% of the marriages between people already in this city; in

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

4 Wolanski, Jarosz, Pyzuk

1958 there are as many as 65% of marriages
of this kind; and in 1962, 76% (Table 2).
When 1945 is adopted as a starting point or
year zero (which from the biological viewpoint is relatively true), the advances noted
for 1945-50 amount to 41.0% for the fiveyear period, 24% for the period 1950-58
(or 15.0% in five years), and 11% for 195862 (or 13.8% in five years). It may be inferred from the above that, in practice, complete biological integration will take place
around 1976-77. It is an important piece of

exactly, the places from which they originate.

During the period investigated, 1950 to
1962, the parents were increasingly younger
at the time of birth of their children. In 1962
mothers averaged 0.5, and fathers 1.5 to 2
years younger than in 1950 (Table 3).

As far as marital selection is concerned,
during the twelve years (1949-61) the mean
age difference between parents decreased by
two years (from 4.5 to 2.5 years, as shown
in Table 3).

information that the population of city of
317,000 inhabitants in 1966 should undergo
full biological integration (close to 100% of
marriages within the city) in a single generation (based on the average age of parents in
Szczecin at birth of offspring being about 27
years for women and 30 for men [see Table 3]).

The growth in the share of marriages contracted in Szczecin of parents with distant
birthplaces is accompanied by a decrease in
the frequency of marriages in which the
birthplaces of the spouses were nearby. This
points again to the fact that biological isolation can be measured indirectly by the distance of the birthplaces of spouses, or more

There is apparently no regularity in the
variation of the parents’ body height in the
various age classes of children (Table 3). If,
however, we calculate that the parents of
these children experienced the period of
World War II at the ages shown in Table 4,
then it becomes clear that the smallest
parental stature being shown in the parents
of 8-year-old children is probably the result
of the fact that these parents passed through
the war period at the age of sexual maturation. As is known, aside from the age of
0.5 to 2 years (Wolarski, 1956, 1960;
Massé, Moreigne, and Senecal, 1961), the
period of sexual maturation is particularly
susceptible to disturbances caused by food

Szczecin than in Warsaw. The present data

found for the age of parents or the difference

exceeds both that of Warsaw children of
1959 and Szczecin children of 1960 in all age
classes investigated and for both sexes.

The 8-year-old children of the present
study (the 4-year-old children were then not
yet born) were 2 years old in 1960, and the
16-year-old ones were aged 10 at that time.
These children, too, are now much taller
than children of the same age in 1960 (by 2
to 3 cm., and in the group of 16-year-old
boys by 6.5 cm., compared with data of
Wolafski, 1965).

To a considerable extent we noted similar changes in chest circumference, excepting
4-year-old girls (Table 6).

In all age classes examined, in boys, and
in 16-year-old girls, Quetelet’s index exhibits
changes in the direction of a “heavier” body
build; only girls aged 4 are now slimmer
than girls of the same age six years ago, and
8-year-old girls show no significant differences (Table 6).

ASSUMED EFFECT OF HETEROSIS

Tables 7 and 8 show the basic data
relating to the problem of heterosis. They
give the magnitudes of five investigated
traits in children: stature, Quetelet’s index
(body weight in grams in proportion to
body height in cm.), chest circumference
measured at the height of xiphoidale, head
circumference at metopion and opisthocranion, and the cephalic index (eu-eu: g-op X
100), according to the distance between
birthplaces of parents.

Table 7 shows the marked trend toward
an increase in body height in children in
every age class and in the two sexes (this
regularity does not occur in a clear-cut
manner in 8-year-old girls and 16-year-old
boys) as the distance between the birthplaces of the parents increases, A similar
regularity may also be observed for the
Quetelet index (for 4-year-old boys, and 8and 16-year-old girls this regularity is lacking). The greater the distance between the
birthplaces of the parents, the heavier the
body build characterizing their children. A

Social Biology

similar relationship exists for chest circumference, with the exception of 4-year-old
boys and 16-year-old girls. |

A regularity of this kind does not occur,
however, for head circumference or shape
(Table 8). For head circumference, this
tendency occurs only in the group of 4-yearold boys; for head shape (cephalic index),
contradictory trends of relationship are recorded in some cases in the various age
classes and sexes, or there is no interrelationship.

In order to render still more objective the
assessment of the investigated phenomenon
—-an assessment which is of decisive importance for the present study—the correlation coefficients were also calculated for
the relation between the values of a given
trait in children and the distance between
the birthplaces of their parents. Table 9 contains these coefficients with the determination of their significance.

A positive correlation (using four field
tables of correlation, because of skewness of
the distance distributions) between the distance between the birthplaces of parents
and the value of the trait in their children is
present in 5 out of 6 groups. This correlation, however, is not present for head circumference nor cephalic index. Apart from
2 or 3 statistically nonsignificant coefficients,
there are 2 cases of one-directional changes.
Where the signs of the correlation coefficients
vary in different subgroups, we are of the
opinion that this ought to be interpreted as
a lack of adequate evidence of regularities
in the relationship in respect to head circumference and shape.

DISCUSSION

We investigated whether stature in children bore some relation to the body size or
age of the parents. First we investigated
whether traits such as stature, age, and the
difference between the ages of the spouses
are modified in a systematic direction with
increasing distance between the birthplaces
of spouses (Table 10 and 11). From the disDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

tributions and from the coefficients of correlation between the given trait of the parents and the distance separating them from
their birthplaces, there is no such relation
(Table 9). Also, the body height of children
in various subgroups standardized for the
stature of the respective parents (Table 10
and 11) shows no regular direction of
changes.

It results from the above that the observed increase in body height of the children as the distance between the birthplaces
of the father and mother increases is not explained by genetic traits of the parents
themselves, nor is it connected with the age
of the father and mother, or with the difference between their ages. This also means
that the regularity observed does not result
from paragenetic factors such as the age of
the parents.

The possible role of social and economic
factors has also been discounted, since we
did not find any systematic trend in parents
from diverse subgroups. We took into account the differences between the professions of the parents, the general living conditions, and the regions from which the parents came.

The control of these factors is important,
as it is known that such factors as the age of
the parents, the sequence of the pregnancy
from which a given child comes, the month
of life in which it is examined, the social
environment, the sex of the child, and the
month in which the child was born exert a
greater influence on intergroup differences
than the inbreeding index (Schork, 1964).

We think that the only remaining plausible explanation of the regularity noted is the
effect of inbreeding or crossbreeding in
groups with a smaller or larger distance between the birthplaces of the parents.

Since, as far as is known at present,
quantitative traits are determined by a
large number of weakly acting genes, a factor ought to be sought among the factors
connected with crossbreeding which can ex

plain the regularity observed. The possibility comes to mind that an effect of
heterosis (understood as high hybrid vigor)
is involved. Obviously as the distance between the birthplaces of parents grows, the
percentage of distant crossings between subjects with different (allelic) gene sets in a
great number of loci groups also increases.

Falconer (1960), working with animals,
and Schull (1962) and Schork (1964) working with man found that when the inbreeding coefficient grew by 10%, the magnitude
of a trait decreased by 1 to 5%, according
to various data and for various traits. An
analogous reasoning leads to the conclusion
that, as the degree of crossbreeding increases, the magnitude of traits in the offspring grows. This would corroborate our
assumption about the role of crossbreeding
in the regularity that we noted.

We find the explanation also as representative of a kind of ecological regularity.
The more distant the birthplaces of the
parents are, the more it is that they come
from populations mutually very different
from the viewpoint of the frequency of
genes appearing in them (gene pools). This
is a direct consequence of communication
obstacles. The administrative division of the
country, the lack of appropriate lines of communication in all directions (in particular
in the prewar and wartime period when the
parents of the children investigated were
born), and other similar factors determined
that the distance in the geographic sense
was tantamount to a relative isolation in
the biological, and even demographic, sense.
The existence of local physiological adaptations may be an important factor. A father
and mother who grew up in regions with
differing kinds of nutrition, modes of life,
microelements in soil and water, and so on
may differ in their metabolic properties
(physiological specificity). This is just the
circumstance capable to some extent of
exerting an influence upon the “‘physiological effect of heterosis.’’ Moreover, there are

some data (Ounsted and Ounsted, 1966)
pointing to the possibility of the mother
transmitting some traits not as genetic
determinants but by a certain constraint of
the intrauterine environment.

It is of interest that Morton (1958) and
Schork (1964) found no heterosis effect in
newborn babies and small infants that they
investigated. In particular, Morton, when
investigating the body weight of children
from endogamous and exogamous marriages,
found no statistically significant differences
in newborn infants and only a slight one in
the ninth month of life in Japanese girls.

Moss, 1959; Tanner, 1960; Livson, McNeill,

1963; Charzewska and Wolanski, 1964;
Garn and Rohmann, 1966; Schreider, 1967;
Wolariski and Chrzastek-Spruch, 1969).
This view also seems to be confirmed in
our investigations in the fact that the traits
which at birth exhibit a lower level of development (as compared with the values attained by the adult subject) such as body
height (34%), chest circumference (41%)
exhibit a strong effect of heterosis (Table
12), while a trait such as head circumference

The same author found no significant difference between the body lengths of newborn
infants from the two kinds of families, but
found it in nine-month-old infants. He
found no differences for chest and head
circumference. Schork found no significant
differences in infants two to four months
old in body weight; for body length they are
significant from the ninth month of age. For
head and chest circumference there are no
differences between newborn babies, and
minor, but insignificant, differences appear
in nine-month-old infants.

A number of authors, however, point out
that the strength of genetically conditioned
interrelations grows with age and appears in
a statistically significant manner only at the
time of sexual maturation. It does not appear in newborn infants, but is intensified
only for some traits around the third or

61.8

in which a newborn infant has 62% of
adult value, shows no effect of heterosis.
The cephalic index grows until the seventh
to tenth month of age by some eight units,
and then it decreases systematically in the
course of 1 to 2.5 years by some four units
(Bayley, 1936; Terada and Hoshi, 1965),
and afterwards—for the next forty years—
it diminishes by scarcely four to six units
(Wolafski and Charzewska, 1967). Thus,
both traits relating to the head are determined mainly during fetal development, and
the two exhibit no heterosis effect.

In connection with the differences found
in the occurrence of the heterosis effect between the various traits, it is worth remembering that the coefficient of variability
(v) of the various traits is in general the
smaller, the higher the degree of development of the trait attained at the time of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 17, No. 1

birth. Table 12 supplies the values for the
eighth year of life, as then the variability is
the smallest. This points either to more
unified conditions of the intrauterine environment or to a weaker manifestation of
genetic differences of the embryo in the
prenatal period.

From the above it seems clear that the
heterosis effect develops mainly in the postnatal period. It is therefore probably a
phenomenon related to the process of the
postnatal development itself—probably a
higher sensitivity to external environment
conditions.

From further analysis of our data (Table
9), it appears that increase in the absolute
value of the traits investigated prevails in
4-year-old children of the two sexes and 16year-old boys, but only in one case in 16year-old girls. This may indicate that the
heterosis effect is adevelopmental trait; that
in certain periods it can grow, and then decrease. However, Hulse (1957), Nold (1963),
and Schreider (1967), found the heterosis
effect also in adult subjects. It is therefore
possible that the heterosis effect manifests
itself on the one hand in the development
rate and on the other in its duration. As we
have only cross-sectional materials, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the differences observed manifested themselves in
different ways according to the changing
conditions of life, since these conditions were
considerably modified in the course of the
twelve years separating the youngest children from the oldest ones in our investigations,

The assumptions formulated here ought
to be treated with great caution and to be
considered as working hypotheses which require further meticulous investigation. They
are, however, worth attention, since they
coincide with observations from other fields
of biology, for instance, “‘an artificia] 1:1
mixture of parent mitochondria showed
heterosis with respect to oxidation and
phosphorylation” (McDaniel and Sarkis
Heterosis in Man 13

sian, 1966, p. 1640). If this phenomenon,
discovered in plants, proves valid also for
man it would mean that the heterosis effect
represents a change in the developmental
rate connected with a higher level of metabolism.?

Furthermore, animal hybrids are usually
physiologically younger than subjects of
pure races (Kolgtaj, personal communication) which seems to be confirmed in man by
the fact that in Cuba, Negro girls mature
on the average at the age of 12.3 years and
white girls at 12.4 years, while the mulatto
girls mature at the age of 12.6 years (from
Laska-Mierzejewska, 1965). This might imply differing sensitivity of heterozygous subjects to environmental stimuli. Tables 7 and
8 show that the above phenomenon Is more
common in boys than in girls; thus, the
heterosis effect seems to show sex differences.

Table 7 points to the fact that the various
distances between the birthplaces of the
father and mother exert an unequal influence on the directional changes of traits in
children. Thus, the observed regularity—
that properties of traits in children grow
concomitantly with the increase in the
distance between the birthplaces of the
parents—is realized for the various age
classes, sexes, and traits between the distance 0-10 and 11-50 km., and between
101-300 km. We shall come back to this
problem in forthcoming investigations. Here,
We want only to formulate a hypothetical
assumption referring to results to date. We
consider it probable, for example, that a
difference between 0-10 and 11-50 km. subgroups can have a strong influence with respect to genetic differences, whereas considerable distance, such as between 101-300
and over 300 km., can influence differences
in environmental conditions, in the different
ecological niches of such distant populations.

2 There are some similar indications from re
search on animals by Kolgtaj (1966, 1967, unpublished).

To a considerable extent our material
came from isolates, such as the prewar villages in regions beyond the Bug River in
eastern Poland. As is known, the exchange
of genes between pools which for a long
time had remained in isolation can cause a
profusion of variations and “material” for
selection (Auerbach, 1965). It seems that the
same may apply to the heterosis effect by
itself, and therefore our results are particularly remarkable. This observation does
not yet explain this phenomenon.

Repeated attempts at a genetic explanation of heterosis have been published. It is a
common opinion that heterosis consists on
the one hand in effects in connection with
heterozygosis in relation to mutated recessive genes, and on the other in such a genetic
mechanism as the interaction of dominance
and superdominance (Stern, 1960; Auerbach, 1965; Kolataj, 1966, 1967).

Another mechanism recently pointed out
is placental hypertrophy in the case of a
heterogenetic relation between mother and
fetus, as a result of a set of genes transmitted
to the fetus by the father differing from the
genes transmitted by the mother, or, in
general, proper to the mother (Billington,
1964). In favor of this hypothesis are observations on mice, and observations that
there is a correlation between the weight of
the placenta and the size of the fetus in
human beings also (Lesinski, 1962; Ounsted
and Ounsted, 1966).

As far as the genetic mechanisms of the
heterosis effect are concerned, we cannot
derive any new elements on the basis of our
investigations. Our materials, however,
throw some light on the hypothesis of ‘‘placental hypertrophy.” Were this hypothesis
true, the effect of heterosis would be the
more strongly marked the stronger a given
trait is developed (in relation to its magnitude in an adult subject) in the period of
prenatal development. We found, quite on
the contrary, that head circumference shows
no heterosis effect, and this effect is a minor

Social Biology

one for other traits in newborn babies and
infants (Morton, 1958; Schull, 1962; Schork,
1964; Schull and Neel, 1965); instead, it
grows with age. It seems therefore that the
“placental hypertrophy” hypothesis should
be rejected in the interpretation of heterosis.
In respect to secular trend, body height
grows in children concomitantly with increase in the distance between the birthplaces of their parents, At the same time, in
Szczecin in recent years, the number of
marriages has increased in which the spouses
were born at a great distance one from the
other, and the number of marriages has decreased in which birthplaces are closely
situated. The body height of Szczecin children has also risen in recent years. The same
factor, heterosis, could therefore be one of
the factors responsible for the increase in
body height in Szczecin children.

CONCLUSIONS

In an investigation carried out on the
newly forming population in Szczecin we
obtained the following results.

In reference to demographic and biological
changes:

1. Stature and chest circumference of Szczecin children increased in the years 1960-66.

2. Between 1950 and 1962, for the ageclasses of children investigated by us, the
percentage of parents who had married in
Szczecin itself nearly doubled. This means
a far-reaching biological integration of
the population of this city.

3. In the years 1949-61 the proportion of
marriages between persons born in regions
distant from each other increased; marriages of those born in neighboring areas
decreased. Thus, the percentage of marriages in which the partners had a low
probability of being related in any way
increased, and the inbreeding coefficient
presumably dropped.

4. The coincidence of the above events supports the hypothesis that more distant
crossings comprise one of the causes of
the secular trend of body height and chest
circumference in Szczecin children.

5. In 1962 mothers had children at an age
some 0.5 years younger than in 1950; the
fathers were some 1.5 to 2 years younger.

6. Parents who passed through their period

of sexual maturation during World War IT
displayed a lower stature than those who
experienced the war years before or after
that stage of their development.

In reference to the development of children
according to the distance between the birthplaces of their fathers and mothers:

1. It was found that along with the increase
in the distance between the birthplaces of
the father and mother, the body height,
chest circumference, and body weight
(Quetelet’s index) of their children in general increased also.

2. No systematic trends were found between
body height and age of the parents and
the distance between the parental birthplaces. Neither were there such relationships with living conditions, profession,
and the like. Thus, neither the genetic
determination of body height by a gene
set determining the stature, nor paragenetic factors, such as the age of the parents, nor differences in living conditions
can be made responsible for the regularity
observed. As the age variation was strictly
limited (+1.5 months), differences caused
by developmental age ought to be automatically eliminated. Nor are there any
influences of measuring technique—the
time of day when the investigations were
made and so on—since they were standardized. Therefore, the observed regularity is apparently caused by crossbreeding, and it ought to be assumed that this
is an effect of heterosis with a genetic or
ecological (physiological) base, or both.

3. The heterosis effect was not found for such
traits as head shape (cephalic index) or
head circumference.

Heterosis in Man 15

4, Since the head circumference attained at
the birth of the child is 62% of the size in
the adult subject—as compared with 6%
for body weight, 34% for body height, and
41% for chest circumference—the conclusion emerges that the heterosis effect
appears mainly through the determination
of the rate of development (intensity) in
the postnatal period.

5. The results obtained testify against the
hypothesis explaining the mechanism of
heterosis by “placental hypertrophy” in
the instance of a heterogenous relation
between the mother and the embryo. We
found no heterosis effect in traits developing particularly intensely in the embryonal
stage.
