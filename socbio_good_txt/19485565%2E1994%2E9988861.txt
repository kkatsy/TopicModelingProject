ABSTRACT: Fertility change over time in a migrating Mennonite church congregation is reconstructed through genealogies developed from church registries of vital events during 1725-1924.
The congregation was located in Prussia from 1725-1821, in Russia from 1822-1874, and in
Kansas, U.S.A., from 1875-1924. Age-specific marital fertility rates were relatively low and
usually peaked for women aged 25-29. Total fertility rates ranged from 1.19 to 5.29. These
relatively low figures for a natural fertility population may partly reflect underreporting of births
and deaths of infants, but it also reflects the heterogeneity in fertility evident for this population.
Some women had many children while others were having either few or none. This pattern
changed twice. Fertility was lowest during residence late in Prussia and early in Russia, peaked
during residence late in Russia, and has decreased slightly for women born in the United States.

Demographers describe population
fertility as either controlled or natural
depending on whether or not parents
modify their behavior in response to
the number of children already born
(Henry, 1961). Natural fertility also includes deliberate spacing of births as
long as the spacing behaviors are independent of family size (Knodel, 1983).
Controlled fertility (family limitation)
includes behaviors intended to result in
a specific family size and are a historically late development documented
first in eighteenth-century Western
Europe (Coale, 1986; van de Walle,
1986). The fertility decline associated
with these behaviors was achieved
largely by reducing the number of
births in the later years of a woman’s
reproductive span (stopping) rather
than by delaying marriage (late start)
or through an increase in the interbirth
interval (spacing). The goal here will
be to examine the starting, stopping,

and spacing behaviors associated with
changing levels of fertility in a migrating Mennonite church congregation
during the period 1775 to 1899.
Separation of church and state and
adult baptism characterize the Anabaptist movement which originated
during the Reformation in sixteenthcentury Switzerland and spread to
Germany, the Netherlands, and other
parts of Europe (Dyck, 1981; Smith,
1981). Dutch Anabaptists united under
the leadership of Menno Simons and
were known as Mennonites. Severe
persecution forced them to migrate to
other parts of Europe, including the
Polish-controlled Danzig area. In 1699
eighteen families formed the Przechowka Church located on the west
side of the Vistula River sixty miles
south of Danzig (Gdansk) (Duerksen,
1955; Rogers, 1984). The congregation included primarily refugees from
the Netherlands. Other founders were

from southern Germany, Switzerland,

Polish rulers grudgingly supported
the settlement, but when Prussia took
control of the area in 1772 the exemption from military service and land
availability became problematic (Friesen, 1989; Krahn, 1955). Mennonites
were invited to settle in southern Russia, and almost the entire congregation
(21 families) migrated in 1821 and
founded the Alexanderwohl congregation at the Molotschna Mennonite settlement located in Taurida Province,
Russia, on the Molochnaya River
(Duerksen, 1955; Rogers, 1984). The
community flourished until land shortages and the military exemption were
again threatened. Almost the entire
congregation moved to Kansas and established two churches, one of which is
also named Alexanderwohl and is located near Goessel, Kansas.

church started their book in 1784
(Duerksen, 1955; Mennonite Immigrant Historical Foundation, 1980). Jacob Wedel, a minister of the Przechowka Church, also reconstructed the
genealogical history of the founding
members back to 1669 (Duerksen,
1955). During the move from Prussia
to Russia the congregation changed its
name to Alexanderwohl but continued
keeping records. Both sets of records
have been translated and published
(e.g., Mennonite Historical Foundation, 1980, 1987), and _ post-1874
records are available at the Bethel College Archives.

For each individual there may be information on residences, parents, and
month, day, and year of birth, baptism, marriage(s), and death. All analyses required exact birth dates of each
mother and all her children. Exact
death dates of mothers were also necessary for the calculation of parity progression ratios, the proportions of
women at each parity, and interbirth
intervals. Ages at time of marriage for
mothers and fathers are also described.
The proportions of the total population
by sex and period with these data are
presented in Table 1. Note that data
are most complete for the mid- to late

1800’s, a period that precedes the
church fissions following their move to
the United States.

METHODS

Henry (1972) was the first to try to
determine the characteristics of fertility in the absence of birth control and
noted (1961; also reviewed in Knodel,
1983; Wilson, 1984; Wilson et al.,
1988; Wood, 1990) the striking differences in age-specific patterns between
populations practicing natural versus
controlled fertility. When no birth control is used, fertility declines primarily
as a function of age, decreasing somewhat more rapidly after age 35. The
average fertility as measured by total
fertility rates in natural fertility populations may vary substantially, but the
pattern remains the same. When family limitation is practiced, fertility rates
drop sooner and are dramatically lower
in the later years of a woman’s reproductive span. Age-specific marital fertility rates are calculated for 25-year intervals (1775-1799, 1800-1824
1900-1924). Another measure of the
age pattern of fertility is the proportion
of the total marital fertility ratio contributed by women after the age of 30
years (Knodel, 1979; Wilson, 1984).

Parity progression ratios are also
calculated because they provide another perspective on the pattern described above (Shryock and Siegel,
1975). The proportion of women for a
particularly parity who go on to have
another child will remain high if natural fertility is practiced. These ratios
drop dramatically at the higher parities
when fertility is being controlled (e.g.,
Wilson, 1984). Sample sizes are small
for the Prussian period. Thus, vital sta
Mennonite Fertility 1775-1899

85

tistics for women born during a 100year period (1725-1824) in Prussia are
used to calculate the first set of ratios.
The remaining ratios are derived from
women born during the successive
three 25-year intervals. There are insufficient numbers of women with
death data to extend the analysis to a
fourth 25-year cohort (1900-1924)
since this data was initially compiled in
1982-83.

Another way to limit births would
be to marry later and reduce the childbearing time. The average ages of
mothers at marriage and first and last
births and the average age of fathers at
marriage are also calculated at 25-year
intervals.

Finally, an additional means of limiting fertility would be to increase the
time between births, but detecting
intentionally lengthened birth intervals in historical data is problematic
(Knodel, 1987). Interbirth intervals
are inversely correlated with the number of children ever born and increase
with the age of the mother within a
group of women with the same completed family size (CFS). Age of marriage is also inversely correlated with
the length of interbirth intervals for
a group of women with the same CFS.

' In a Mormon population, Anderton

and Bean (1985) demonstrate that interbirth intervals are stable within a
group of women having the same CFS
and remain stable during fertility
transition, although proportions of
women with lower CFS’s increase. Interbirth intervals controlled for completed family size and proportions of
women at each parity are also calculated. Again, the Prussian period is
represented by women born during
a 100-year period (1725-1824). The

RESULTS

Age-specific marital fertility rates,
total marital fertility rates (TMF), and
total marital fertility after age 30 as a
per cent of the total marital fertility
(TMFR30+) are presented at 25-year
intervals for the Mennonites of this
study in Table 2. Comparative populations representing natural (English
parishes, Bavarian villages, and Ohio
Amish) and _ family-limited (U.S.
women) fertility schedules are also included. The pattern of the rates are
presented in Figure 1 with the classic

example of natural fertility, the Hutterites. The intervals covering 17751824, 1825-1874, and 1875-1924, represent stays in Prussia, Russia, and the
United States, respectively. At least 50
women are represented in each 25-year
category which Handwerker (1988) has
demonstrated is the minimum needed
in order to estimate accurate fertility
rates. Note that the age-specific rates
within a particular cohort peak when
women are aged 25-29 years with one
exception, e.g., 1850-1874. Total marital fertility rates vary but are at least
4 after the late Prussian period,
i.e., 1775-1824. The TMFR30 + ratios
range from 38 to 59 per cent. Parity
progression ratios are presented in

Table 3. They remain high throughout
the reproductive span for all cohorts
and only drop slightly for the cohort of
women born during 1875-1899.

Measures of reproductive span at
25-year intervals are presented in Figure 2. The reproductive spans of
women born during 1775-1799 and after 1875 are shorter than for women
born at other times. The mean age at
marriage is relatively high for women
born during 1775-1799. It also increases during their stays in Russia and
the United States and then declines
during 1900-1924. The mean ages of
fathers at first marriage are 24.81,
23.61, 24.93, 24.54, 25.16, and 26.03
years for the intervals 1775-1799,
1800-1824, 1825-1849, 1850-1874,
1875-1899, and 1900-1924, respectively. The husband is on average
about 2 years older than the woman except during 1775-1799 when husband
and wife are virtually the same age.
The biggest difference, 4.83 years, is
found for marriages which take place
between 1900-1924.

Interbirth intervals controlled for
completed family size are presented in
Figure 3. Relatively small sample sizes
result in more irregular curves, but the
sizes of interbirth intervals do not vary
much from period to period except for
the average time between marriage
and first birth. This interval steadily
decreases after the Prussian period av
eraging for all married women 50.4,
44.8, 39.1, and 32.3 months for 17751824, 1825-1849, 1850-1874, and
1875-1899, respectively.

The proportions of women at each
parity for each period and comparative.
population data are presented in Table
4. The proportion of married women
with no children is 15 per cent for
women born during the late Prussian
(1725-1824) and early Russian (18251849) periods. The proportion increases to 17.3 and 22.3 per cent for
women born during the late Russian
(1850-1875) and early U.S. (18751899) periods, respectively. The proportion of women with small families
(1-3 children) is 34 per cent for the
Prussian period, then drops to 16 and
28 per cent for the two Russian-born
cohorts, and increases to 35 per cent
for the U.S.-born cohort. The proportion of women with 7 or more children
also varies: 30.6 per cent for Prussianborn women, increasing to 52.5 and
37.3 per cent for Russian-born women,
and then decreasing to 16.5 per cent for
U.S.-born women.

DISCUSSION

The age-specific rates are relatively
low overall and are particularly low
during their later years in Prussia and
early years in Russia (see Table 2 and

Figure 1). Most rates and the shapes
of the curves fall between or below
the schedules typical for either natural
or family-limited fertility populations.
The total fertility rates ranging from
1.19 to 2.72 fall within the low to
middle range expected for controlledfertility populations; whereas, the total
fertility rates ranging from 4.14 to 5.29
are within the low end of the total fertility rates expected for natural fertility populations (reviewed by Wood,
1990).

The typical peak in age-specific
rates for women aged 25~29 years, except during 1850-1874, is consistent
with the relatively late mean age at
marriage (see Figure 2) and the relatively long mean interval between marriage and first birth (see Figure 3). All
the birth intervals may be slightly inflated (and the age-specific birth rates
lowered) by underreporting of births
and deaths of children who do not survive their first year (Everson et al.,
n.d.; Willigan and Lynch, 1982).

The late Russian period, 18501874, was a time of relative plenty
(Urry, 1989; Wedel, 1974) and the
women giving birth at that time had the
lowest mean ages at marriage and longest reproductive spans (see Figure 2).
The age-specific rates are highest for
the periods covering 1850-1899. Increases in fertility rates over the late
1700’s and early 1800’s might be explained partly by the dampening effect
resulting from the conditions forcing
the move to Russia, but low fertility is
characteristic for a very long time, i.e.,
1775-1849.

In addition, Knodel and Wilson
(1981) have documented a similar latenineteenth-century increase in fertility
in many populations within Germany.

 

Social Biology

They suggest that improvements in
nutrition and overall health may account for the increase in fecundity.
There is no nutritional information for
this Mennonite congregation, but mortality data indicate that one-third to
one-half of the married women born
during the Prussian period did not survive through their reproductive years
(to age 45) (Everson et al., n.d.). After
the move to Russia the rate drops to 20
per cent or less.

A crude measure of the shape of the
age-specific rates is the total marital
fertility after age 30 as a per cent of the
total marital fertility (TMFR30 + ) (see
Table 2). This measure averages 46 per
cent which is close to the 50 per cent
expected for natural fertility populations (Knodel, 1979). One might predict that the ratio would be greater
than 50 per cent because of their late
start. The ratios are still high compared
to family-limited populations which
usually average 25 per cent or less.
Also consistent with natural fertility
are the parity progression ratios (see
Table 3). The ratios remain high
through the higher parities for all cohorts with only slight decreases for the
first cohort to be born in the United
States (1875-1899).

The intermediate pattern of the
rates also reflects the heterogeneous
nature of the population being described (see Table 4). There are a relatively high proportion of married
women with no children, and most of
the remaining women are having large
families. The proportion of married
women having no children steadily increases over all the cohorts. These figures may be inflated by women who
somehow remained connected with the

ber of another congregation. Their
children might not have been recorded
if they were members of another congregation. However, husband’s identification number and marriage date
were present for most of the women in
this category and for all childless married women born during 1875-1899,
the period with the highest proportion
of childless married women. If both

S women, 1946-1950; and (3) married

of Mennonite women having 7 or more

born after 1875 and signals the beginning of the demographic transition for
this congregation. The reproductive
span also shortens for this group. The
mean ages of marriage and first birth
actually decline, but there is an even
greater decline in the mean age at last
birth. Birth intervals do not change
much overall except that the average
time from marriage to first birth continues to decline. The timing of this

transition is consistent with the decline
determined from birth history data
taken from contemporary Mennonite
women, some of whom are descendants of families included in this study
(Stevenson et al., 1989). The contemporary study (a convenience sample)
probably overrepresents the larger and
more conservative families.

CONCLUSIONS

The fertility patterns determined
from examining the vital statistics for
families of a migrating church congregation reveal a great deal of complexity. In particular, some women were
having many children, and some were
having few or no children. The relative
numbers of these two groups of women
shifted at least twice. Life was harsher
in Prussia and early Russia, and there
were more women with smaller families (although not as relatively many
married women with no children). It
cannot be determined if this was due
to high maternal mortality and poorer record-keeping (undercounting of
births and deaths of children who do
not survive the first year) rather than to
deliberate family planning. Some deliberate control might be suggested by
the fact that the interval between marriage and first birth is highest during
this period of time no matter what a
woman’s completed family size and
declines for the cohorts of married
women born later.

In the late Russian period (18501874) the Mennonites became very
successful farmers. Presumably overall
health improved (judging by the reduction in maternal mortality), and the
fertility schedules for this period most
closely resemble schedules for natural

fertility populations such as the Amish
in 1964 (Cross and McKusick, 1970).
After the move to the United States,
fertility eventually begins to decrease.
Women born in the United States
(birthdays after 1875) are more likely
to have smaller families, and there is
an ever-increasing number of childless
married women. Fertile women are
cutting off childbearing in their late
30’s which is how the fertility transition
begins for most European populations
(Coale 1986; van de Walle 1986). The
increasing number of childless women

may be a function of the reduced number of eligible mates, a topic for a future paper.
