Effects of Fertility and Mortality

and Number of Living Children

ABSTRACT: A model is developed to study the effects of fertility and mortality on number of living
children and on extinction of family. Numerical illustrations are provided by applying the model to
three different populations differing in fertility and mortality. It is found that a combination of a
high birth rate and a low death rate is required to assure a reasonable probability that the family will
not ultimately become extinct. A moderate to high birth rate and a low death rate are necessary to
assure that there will be at least one surviving son in the parents’ old age. This finding implies that
zero population growth is impossible as long as parents depend on children for old age security.
Thus, alternate old age security measures must be adopted by societies attempting to reduce their

birth rate to the replacement level.

A desire for continuity of the family
name and for living children to support
them in their old age is thought to
influence the fertility behavior of couples
in many developing countries. A reduction in mortality will increase the chances
of survival for children and the continuation of family name. Thus, it is argued that
with improved mortality conditions couples would tend to limit their reproduction, since a small number of births would
be sufficient to assure continuity of the
family name and survival of one or two
children to support the parents during
their old age.

Keyfitz (1977a, Chap. 18) describes the
use of Branching Process for studying extinction of family name. The East-West
Population Institute (1975) presents data
on continuity of family name as one of the
values of having children expressed by
couples. Not much work has been done to

study the effect of fertility and mortality
levels on extinction of family name;
hence, an attempt is made here to examine this effect.

Relatively more work has been done on
the relationship between child mortality
and fertility. However, there is only limited empirical support for the hypothesis
that the reduction of child mortality is a
necessary and perhaps sufficient condition
for fertility decline (for detailed discussion, see Preston, 1978). Taylor et al.
(1976) state that it is “‘naive for anyone to
suggest that the postulated fertility reduction attributable to increased child survival expectations might compensate fully
for the population growth effects of reduction in child mortality.”” Heer and Smith
(1968) have applied simulation technique
to this problem and find an inverted Ucurve in the growth rate. Preston (1978)
describes recent work in this area of study.
A simple mathematical model is proposed
in this paper to study the effect of the combination of mortality and fertility on the

probability of a couple having a certain
number of children who survive until the
parents reach old age.

THE MODEL

If the force of mortality is M at age f,

then
| = exp |- f Mat]

is the probability that a newborn will survive to age x. Let m,Ax be the probability
of a woman aged x having a daughter in
the age interval x tox + Ax. Leta andB
be the lowest and the highest age reproduction, respectively, and let m,be a continuous function of x. Let us also assume
that all individuals are subject to the same
mortality and fertility rates and that fertility and mortality are independent.

Given the above, Krishnamoorthy
(1979) derived the expression for the
probability that a woman aged x exactly
will have a specified number of children
born to her. First, let us find the expressions for the probabilities that she will
have no daughters, that she will have exactly one daughter, and that she will have
exactly two daughters. Then we will
describe the general case of a woman having r daughters.

The probability that a woman aged x
will have no daughter born to her is

E(0,x) = exp - f mat |,

by the same argument used for deriving /,
with M, as the force of mortality.

To derive the expression for the probability of having only one daughter let us
note that the probability of a woman having a daughter in the small interval of agey
toy + Ay <x ism, Ay and the probability
of not having a girl at any other time in her
life is

Fertility and Mortality

63

exp | _ f mat = i - m,dt|.

Therefore, the conditional probability of
having a girl at the age intervaly to y+ Ay,
and not at any other age, is

exp — f m,dt — I. mda] m,Ay.

By letting Ay>0, we obtain

exp | - J mat | m,dy.

Integrating this quantity over the range 0
to x, we get the probability of a woman
having one and only one daughter at any
age before x. Hence, the probability of a
woman aged x having only one daughter
born at any age in her life is

E(\\,x) = exp] — J mat | J, m,dy.

Now, let us denote

x

» Mm, dy as A(x).

To find the probability of a woman having
two daughters ever born, following the
same argument as above, we can write the
probability of a woman having two and
only two daughters before age x as

A(x) A(x h2(x) ew)
E 2,2) = SEDO ay = NOVEM

We have 2! in the denominator because it
does not concern us whether girl A or girl
B is born at the given time. Hence, in
general, the probability of a woman agedx
having exactly r daughters in her lifetime
is

N(x) e M(x)

E(r,x) = 7

Hoem (1970) developed similar expressions with rigorous mathematical treatment. Both her model and the present
model are based on the assumptions that
women are homogeneous with respect to
fertility and mortality risks and that the
probability of a birth depends on age and
not on previous history.

The probability of a woman dying at
age x is /M, and, therefore the probability
of a female just born having exactly r
daughters ever born by the time of her
death is

* r —X(x)
E(yn =|] imX@e 7 (1)

The expected number of daughters ever
born to a female just born is, therefore,

Integrating by parts, we can show that this
quantity equals

which is known as the net reproduction
rate.

PROBABILITY OF EXTINCTION OF FAMILY

Now, consider only the female population, and let a set of probabilities E(0),
E(1), E(2), . . ., be that a woman has no
daughters, one daughter, etc. If s is the
probability of extinction, then (Keyfitz
1977b, p. 332)

s = E(0) + sE(1) + s?E(2)

Substituting (1) in the above, we can show
that |

S fom, exe ldx

Or

f(s) = I ]M,er dx —s = 0. (4)

This equation can be solved iteratively by
the Newton-Raphson method (Keyfitz,
1977a, p. 111). Usually the data are available in five-year age groups. A numerical
approximation is needed for computational purposes. Expression (4) is approximated by

f(s) = S54 exp lis 3 SF + 2.5 Fe}

where 54x is the fraction of deaths in a life
table between ages x and x + 5 and F(t) is
the age-specific female birth rate for women of aged betweentandt + 5.

For the purpose of illustrating the effect.
of fertility and mortality on extinction of
family, we consider three populations
with differing fertility and mortality levels.
Madagascar is chosen for high fertility and
high mortality; Venezuela, for high fertility and low mortality; and the United
States, for low fertility and low mortality.
The data for these countries are drawn
from the works of Keyfitz and Flieger
(1971). Summary measures of fertility and
mortality, together with probability of extinction, are given in Table 1.

From Table 1, we observe that the United States has the highest probability of .
extinction of family heirs. Though Venezuela has the lowest probability, a girl in
Venezuela still has a 16 per cent chance of
having her family line eventually become
extinct. Opinion surveys in some developing countries have shown that women de

sire a large number of children in order to
have their family name continued. But our
analysis shows that any amount of reduction in mortality is not going to reduce the
probability of extinction closer to zero.
Also, for most of the developed countries
like the United States with low fertility
and mortality, the probability of extinction is still high. Hence, it is implied that
even at the lowest mortality level, only a
moderate reduction in fertility is possible
as long as couples want to have their family name continued.

NUMBER OF LIVING CHILDREN AT A GIVEN
AGE .

Given that a woman is aged x, what is
the probability that she will have exactly k
living daughters? If the woman had a
daughter at age y2 x, then the probability
of that child surviving to the mother’s age
xis/,,. Since the force of maternity ism, at
age y, we can define m, J. , as the effective
maternity. Following closely the argument for E(r,x), we can show that the
probability of a woman aged x having exactly & living daughters is

k — n(x)

Given the life table and the age-specific
fertility rates, we can compute the probability of a mother aged x having a specified
number of living daughters. We can also
compute the probability that there are at
least i surviving daughters at age x of
mother. In order to compute these quantities from observed age-specific birth and
death rates, we need a numerical procedure only for n(x) as long as x is in multiples of five. The approximation used in
this paper is

and integrating over the entire age span of
life, we get the probability that a female
just born will have & surviving daughters

ber of living daughters vary greatly among
these three countries. Within Venezuela
and United States, the distribution and
the average do not vary very much with
the age of women because of the low level
of mortality. On the other hand, owing to
higher mortality, there is a large difference in the distribution of living daughters according to the age of mother in
Madagascar.

Table 3 presents the probability of a
woman of a given age in these countries
having no living daughters, at least one living daughter, and at least two living
daughters. Since Madagascar and Venezuela have the same level of fertility and
only differ in mortality, the difference in
the probability of a woman having at least
one surviving daughter in these two countries is attributable to mortality. On the
other hand, the difference between Venezuela and the United States is mostly attributable to the difference in fertility. In
spite of a very high birth rate in Madagascar, a woman aged 70 has only a 0.79 probability of having at least one living daughter because of the high mortality, rate.

ora boy is 0.5, the same probability can be
interpreted as the chance of having at least
one surviving son. Such an interpretation
implies that a combination of low mortality and high fertility, like that found in
Venezuela, is necessary for a woman aged
60 to be about 95 per cent confident of
having at least one living son. Moderate
fertility and low mortality can achieve
about 85 per cent confidence. The implication of such a finding is that, if couples depend on children for their old age security,
One may expect only a moderate decline in
fertility to follow the decline in mortality.
Alternate sources of old age security seem
to be inevitable in such societies in order
to induce a fertility decline to the replacement level.

LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL

The model assumes independent probabilities of birth and death at each moment. Obviously a minimum time interval
exists between successive births, due to
length of gestation, post-partum amenorrhea, waiting time to conceive, etc. A
model that incorporates these factors will

be more complicated. The simple model
proposed is expected to be sufficient for
the purpose of this inquiry, and the author
believes that the findings may not be far
different from those obtained from more
elaborate models.

The following helps to illustrate the approximation involved in the model’s assumption: First, let us assume that the fertility rate is f per year and that a woman
can have only one child in a year. This allows for some interval between successive
births. If women experience the same fertility rate for 7 years, at the end of the period the probability that a woman has had
r births is, by binomial theorem,

(71) fr (1—-fyr—r

Now as n->«(for n sufficiently large),
Poisson approximation to the binomial
distribution is valid. Since women have a
reproductive period of about 25 years, we
can see that Poisson distribution is approximated.

We also assume that the probability of
occurrence of a birth does not differ for

women of different birth order. This assumption may be true in a natural fertility
population; but in a population where
family limitation is widely practiced, the
model will overestimate the probability of
extinction and the probability of having no
living daughters. In such circumstances,
age and parity-specific birth rates may be
used. Increment-decrement life table
models (Oechsli, 1975; Schoen, 1975; Rogers, 1975) are appropriate for analyzing
such data. It is easy to recognize a situation where the next birth depends more on
the existing living children than on
children-ever-born. Such elaborations
could be handled by computer simulation.
Unfortunately, such population data are
not usually available so that detailed
models including computer simulations
have had to depend on hypothetical data.
Hence, the proposed model, although it
might produce biased results because of its
naive assumptions, has the great advantage of being applied to real data.

The assumption that the rates of birth
and death remain constant between successive generations implies a stable population. This assumption reduces the relevance of the model for many developing
countries. The model could still be useful
in comparing two stable conditions even
though applications to dynamic situations
are not possible.

Sterility and marriage are two more important factors which differentiate women
with respect to fertility. Although they are
not taken into consideration in this study
because of the limitations of the data, they
can easily be incorporated in the model
with minor modifications.

This result can be interpreted as follows:
A small but finite 8 times increase in maternity function will result in an increase of
the amount of 6 times the probability of
having one and only one surviving daughter in the probability of having at least one
surviving daughter.

Similarly, for a change in mortality at
all ages, i.e.,

Noting that In /,., is negative and all other
values are positive, we find, as our intuition also tells us, that an increase in mortality will decrease the probability of having at least one surviving daughter.

CONCLUSION

The model proposed is essentially a
nonhomogenous Poisson process which
assumes that disjoint intervals of age act
independently with respect to births and
death. The limitations of the model have
been discussed in the text. However, the
results of the simple model presented may
not be far different from those based on an
elaborate model. The probability of the
eventual extinction of a family is low only
with the combination of a high birth rate
and a low death rate. This finding suggests
that if continuation of family is a decisive
factor in a population, reduction in fertility will not follow a reduction in mortality.

Fertility and Mortality 69

On the other hand, a reasonable probability of at least one surviving son can be
achieved by a moderate birth rate and a
low death rate. This finding implies that if
people depend on their children for old
age security, a reduction in mortality can
be followed by a reduction in fertility, but
not to the replacement level. In such a situation alternate sources of old age security need to be provided for the population
to reach replacement level fertility. Because of the assumptions in the model, the
probability of extinction and the probability of having no living daughters are overestimated for a population where family
limitation is widely practiced. Therefore,
the relationship between childhood mortality and fertility is understated.
