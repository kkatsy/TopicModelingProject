Educational Status and Differential

Fertility in India

I. Z. Husain

Demographic Research Centre
Department of Economics
Lucknow University
Lucknow, India

A sample survey of households in the city
of Lucknow was undertaken (1) to determine the level of fertility and socioeconomic differences, (2) to ascertain the
opinion of the heads of the households on
certain aspects of population control, and
(3) to provide data for drawing a stratified
sample for the depth study of fertility currently in progress,}

Educational status of the households was
taken as one of the cultural variables influencing the level of fertility. The educational status of a household was judged by
the level of education of the head and the
highest achievement in the family by adult
male and female members The variation

1 The survey was conducted by the Demographic
Research Centre, Economics Dept., Lucknow University. It was based on a sample of 4,420 households
out of the ration-card list of households in the city of
Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh, one of the
largest states in India. The technique of simple
random sampling with replacement was adopted.
Two independent subsamples, A and B, were drawn
to verify the results. Due to the small number of
births in each category of socioeconomic variable, the
fertility analysis is based on the total sample. In this
case other statistical tests are applied for testing the
conclusions.

*The “head” was defined as the chief breadwinner of the family and “household” consisted of
members eating together. The highest educational
achievement implies the highest level of education
attained by any member of the household.

 

in mean age at marriage, fertility, and opinions of the heads of the households on certain aspects of population are examined in
the paper by all the three indices of educational status in order to observe the influence
of both vertical and horizontal expansion of
education. The analysis may reveal the effect of education on the level of fertility on
the one hand, and its determinants, like
mean age at marriage, and the opinion of the
head of the household on family-size norms
and the problem of liberalization of abortion
laws on the other.

It would be pertinent at this stage to
point out that differentials by education in
mean age at marriage, fertility, and attitudes toward family planning may be affected by the differences in the age of females with less or more education or by
differences in their background, i.e., urban
or rural. To eliminate these effects, the
best method would be to apply cohort
analysis. However, the data of our survey
are not amenable to such treatment since
the investigation was not directed toward
the relationship between fertility of mothers
and their education or their rural/urban
background, but rather toward the relationship of the educational and residential

background of a family to age at marriage,
fertility, and attitudes. Our findings are in
no way vitiated by the lack of data for
cohort analysis, since our results indicate
that the average age of females in families of
different educational background is more or
less the same, and any differences are in
favor of a higher average age of females in
more educated households than in others, as
shown in Table 1.

in the background of the parents. For instance, it was observed in the United States
that differentials in fertility in respect to
education in urban couples are generally
accounted for by those urban couples in
which at least one spouse has a farm background in the sense that the spouse’s father
was a farmer when the spouse was 16 years
old,

We wish such specific data were available

* Those who cannot read or write are treated as ‘Illiterate, while those who can do
so with or without forma! schooling are sted as at “Below primary”? Jevel. Five years

of successful schooling is termed as ‘‘Prima

*” and that of ten to twelve years as ‘‘Sec
ondary.” Vocational training is also categorized within ‘‘Secondary.”” Education up to
graduate or postgraduate Jevel, including professional education, is termed ‘‘Higher.”’

It is obvious from the above data that females in households of all educational groups
are almost equally young or old. Hence, any
observed differentials in fertility with respect to education cannot be due to the
more educated households being younger
and the less educated households being
older, and the different groups having different years of child bearing.

Differential fertility with respect to education even after the elimination of agefactor may still be due in part to differences

for our inquiry; but all that we have is
the rural-urban background of households
as determined by the ordinary residence of a
head of household in a rural or urban area
during the last ten years. This criterion was
selected for purposes of measuring the extent
of assimilation and adoption of urban values
and way of life which may be significant in
fertility behavior.

The data reveal that a little more than
94% of the sample households were urban,
and less than 6% had a rural background.

This is certainly startling since the heavy
rural-urban migration in the country would
lead one to expect that there would be a
substantial proportion of rural-background
families, Therefore, this phenomenon needs
an explanation. It lies partly in the fact
that the pattern of migration to the large
cities is usually from a village to a small
town and thence to a larger town. Our city
being the capital of the largest state in the
country has mostly migrants from other
towns rather than from villages. Hence,
there are not many people, even among migrants, who themselves or whose parents
have been farmers or cultivators. Moreover,

male and female mean age at marriage
and the educational status of the head. The
finding is supported by the data of the two
subsamples as well as that of the total
sample (see Table 2). In spite of a small dispersion of two to three years in mean age at
marriage, there is a consistent increase in
age with a rise in educational status. The
female mean age at marriage increases from
a little less than 16 years in households with
illiterate heads of households to more than
18 years with higher education of heads.
Mean age at marriage of males is higher by
some four to five years than that of females
and increases from 20 years in households
with illiterate heads to 23 years in those

the worker is now usually a townsman. In
view of this, we may assume that the rural/
urban or agricultural/non-agricultural background differences among the more and less
educated of the urban households are only
marginal,

where the heads are educated up to the
Secondary and Higher level. A rise in educational status of heads from Illiteracy to
Literacy (Below Primary) makes very little
difference in the mean age at marriage of
females; but beyond this level there are
larger gains in mean age at marriage. For
households which have heads educated up to
Primary or Below Primary levels it remains
around 21 years.

A direct relationship is also observed in
mean ages at marriage of both sexes and the
highest educational attainments of adult
males in the households (Table 3). In both
the subsamples as well as in the total sample,
the mean age at marriage of males increases
gradually with the level of education and the
dispersion is of about three years. The female mean age at marriage in households
where all the males are illiterate is about 16

years, and it increases to a little less than
18 years where the highest educational attainments of adult males is up to graduate
or post-graduate level.

The educational standards of adult females have the same influence on mean age
at marriage as that of the head of household (Table 4). The mean age at marriage
of females increases from about 16 years in
households with illiterate females to 18.5
in those where the highest achievement was

GENERAL FERTILITY

The educational status of the head is also
significant in determining the level of fertility in the households. The highest fertility
of 243.6 is recorded for the households where
the head is completely illiterate and declines
consistently with a rise in his educational
status, with the exception that it is a little

graduation or post-graduation. The male
mean age at marriage also varies from about
20 years to 23 years with corresponding
variations in female education. There may
be a co-variation between the educational
attainment of heads and its female members,
and therefore the extent of differences in
mean age at marriage by their educational
status does not differ. But a positive relationship between the mean age at marriage
of males and females and the educational
attainment of heads and its members gives
support to the hypothesis that the cultural

higher for heads having higher education
than for those where it is confined up to
secondary level. The educational standards
of adult males seem to have the same influence on fertility as that of head of the
household. There is again a clear negative
relationship between the highest educational
standard of adult males in the household
and its fertility.

General fertility also varies indirectly
with female education. Starting with a
general fertility rate of 164 in households
where all the females are illiterate, it falls

gradually in households with Primary or
Secondary level of maximum education and
reaches a minimum of 68 with highest attainment by females up to the Higher level.
The level of fertility is comparatively lower
in all categories when households are classified by female education. At the low levels
of education, it indicates larger influences of

children a young couple should have under
the present conditions. A direct relationship was observed between the educational
achievement of the heads of the households
and the size of family which they preferred
(Table 6). The preference for only one child
was not very high in general, but a higher
proportion of educated heads of household
chose this number than those with primary
or lower levels of education, including the
illiterates. Less than 8% of the illiterate
heads preferred two children, while 24%
of the highly educated heads chose this
number, Similarly, preference for three
children also successively increased with
the levels of education. In general, there
was a higher preference for three children
than for two, but the difference was more
marked among households with secondary
education than in other categories. The
preference for four children was smaller
than for two or three, and there were no

head of household and its male members
than that of the females. It may also be due
to the existence of educated members in
the family where the females might be completely uneducated. On the other hand, an
extremely low fertility associated with secondary and higher education of females
testifies to the cumulative impact of all
educational development of the households
on fertility behavior (Table 5).

OPINION ON SIZE OF FAMILY

The heads of the households were asked
to express their opinions on the number of

marked differences among households with
different levels of education with regard to
preference for five, six, or more children.
The proportion of responses for four children
follows a bell-shaped curve, as it was lowest
among illiterate heads and increased with
below-primary and primary education. After
reaching the peak at primary level, it again
fell with higher levels of education.

A most significant feature is the indefinite
response given by an overwhelming majority
of illiterate and meagerly educated heads of
households, in spite of the recent intensive
family-planning program in the city. The

proportion of such responses, however, declined with a rise in educational status. It is
the uneducated high-fertility group which
has the largest fluidity of opinion on such
matters.

The variation in the opinion of the head
on the desired number of children by the
highest educational standard of the adult
males in the household was almost the same
as by the education of its head; but the
proportion of indefinite responses was much

of the heads of the households preferred only
one child where the females were highly
educated. Another 42% of the households in
this category considered two to be the
proper number, and more than 38% gave
preference for three. Only 8.5% of the
heads in households with highly educated
females gave preference for four children, A
negligible proportion of heads in such households was in favor of five children, while
no one responded for six or more.

higher in households where all the adult
males were illiterate than in those where only
the head was uneducated and it decreased
with an increase in level of education
(Table 7).

The influence of education on the number
of children considered to be ideal is further
supported by the variation in the opinion
of heads by the highest educational standard
of adult females (Table 8). The preference
for two or three children increased with a
rise in highest educational attainments of
females in the household. As many as 4.3%

Preference for two children increased
very sharply with the level of education of
adult females in the households. In general,
there was a larger preference for three
children than for two except in households
with higher attainment of education by the
females. A much lower proportion of households in all educational categories responded
for four, and it followed the same bellshaped curve as revealed with respect to
education of household heads. No trend

education. The proportion of indefinite responses also continued falling with a rise
in the highest level of education attained
by a female in a household.

OPINION ON LIBERALIZATION
OF ABORTION

A wide divergence in the opinion of the
head of the household on the problem of
liberalization of abortion laws was observed
by the educational status of the households.
Only about 3% of the illiterate heads of the
households were in favor of liberalization,
while this proportion increased to 43%

tional status of adult males in the households; but the ratio of opinions in favor to
those against was not so favorable. On the
other hand, opinions in favor of liberalization of abortion were generally more numerous among households where the females
were also educated up to a certain level than
among uneducated households (Table 9).
It increased consistently with a rise in educational achievement of the females in the
households. However, there was no marked
divergence in the proportion of opinion in
favor of liberalization between households
with secondary and higher levels of education of females. A very small proportion of
the heads of households failed to express

households favoring liberalization, from
about 6% to 11% with primary or belowprimary education to 28% among those
educated up to secondary level, and then
to 43% among those with still higher education. The proportion of the heads of the
households with no opinion on the problem
declined with an increase in educational
status. Opinions definitely opposed to abortion laws being liberalized were ten times
more numerous than those favoring it
among the illiterate heads of households.
However, this ratio declined with the level
of education, and opinions in favor and
against were equally divided among heads
who were highly educated. The position
was more or Jess the same when the opinions
of the heads were classified by the educa
their opinion where the females were highly
educated as compared to those with lower
levels of education. The educational level
of the females seems to influence the opinion
of the heads of the households partly because of the correlation between education
of females and heads of household and
partly because of a modernization of outlook
associated with female education.

SUMMARY

The above analysis made on the basis
of a household survey in an urban area indicates (1) a positive relationship between
the educational attainments of household
members including its head and the mean
ages at marriage of males and females; (2)

a strong negative relationship between fertility and educational status of the households; (3) a direct relationship of preference for two or three children with the
educational level of the head and household members; and (4) an increase in the

the important role cultural factors, such as
education, play in molding the reproductive
behavior of a household.
