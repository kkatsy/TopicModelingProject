Among White and Nonwhite Women in the

United States, 1940-1974

ABSTRACT: The historical trends of childlessness and of one-child, two-child, and three-or-morechild families among white and nonwhite women in the United States are studied in terms of
period fertility tables. Given the age and parity of a woman, we can read from the fertility tables
how her parity is expected to change at successive ages during the rest of her childbearing period,
if she is subjected to the age-parity-specific fertility rates for a particular year. The fertility tables
for white and nonwhite women are constructed for the years 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1974.
These tables show that among white women who have completed their childbearing (with period
rates), the percentage with more than two children has decreased from 66 in 1960 to 27 in 1974,
whereas the corresponding reduction among nonwhite women is from 67 to 48 per cent (Table 1,

Case 1).

In a recent paper, the author (1975)
studied the historical trends of spinsterhood and childlessness among white and
nonwhite women in the United States for
the period 1940-70 on the basis of population census data. Since the proportion of
never-married or childless women, as obtained directly from census tables, does
not reflect the marriage or fertility pattern
of the women in the census years but a
cumulative picture of the patterns over a
span of earlier years, synthetic cohorts
based on two consecutive censuses were
constructed to study the period rates for
the decades 1940-50, 1950-60, and
1960-70.

The present paper is an extension of the
earlier work, and attempts to study the
historical trends not only of childlessness
but also of the parity composition of
women with children. Other major differences of the present study from the previous
one are that (1) it uses both census and
vital statistics data instead of only census

populations; (2) it obtains results for five
different years, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970,
and 1974, while the earlier study gave results for three decades, 1940-50, 1950-60,
and 1960-70; and (3) it gives the fertility
picture of total white and nonwhite women, whereas the first study pertained only
to women married once and husband present.

The ultimate results of the present study
are a set of fertility tables, each constructed from the age-parity-specific fertility rates for a particular year. These fertility tables tell us what is expected to
happen to a cohort of 100 women of the
same age and parity in regard to their
parity composition at successive ages as
they pass through the rest of their
childbearing period, if they are subjected
to the age-parity-specific fertility rates for
a particular year and if each of them survives to the end of the childbearing period. For example, 100 women of age 20
and parity 1, when subjected to the fertil

ity rates of white women of the United
States for the year 1974, will have among
them at age 35, 8 women with parity 1, 46
with parity 2, and 46 with parity 3+ (Table 6). All the fertility tables for white and
nonwhite women are presented in Tables
2—7. A summary comparison of the fertility tables for the entire period 1940-74 is
provided in Table 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The method of construction of a fertility
table can be explained by considering the
U.S. data for white women for 1960 as an
example.

Let us consider seven five-year age
groups, 15-19, 20-24, ..., 45-49, and
label them as age groups 1, 2,..., 7. Let
P(x,y) be the total number of women with
parity y in age group x, and B(x,2) the total
number of births of order z to women in
age group x (x = 1,2,...,7;y = 0,1,2;2
= 1,2,3). The age-parity-specific fertility
rate m(x,y) for women aged x with parity y
is defined as

m(x,y) = B(x,y + 1)/P(x,y),
x= 1,2,...,7y=0,1,2. (Y)

For example, P(3,1), the number of
women aged 25-29 with parity 1 is
850,537, and B(3,2), the number of births
of order 2 to women aged 25-29, is
248,124. Therefore, m(3,1), the ageparity-specific fertility rate for women
aged 25-29 with parity 1 is 0.292
( = 248,124/850,537).

We now denote the probability that a
woman of parity y at the beginning age x,
of the age group x will have parity z at the
upper boundary x, + 5 of the same age
group (assuming that she will survive to
age x, + 5) by Q (x,y,2),% = 1,2,..., 73
y,z2 = 0,1,2,3 + (2 = y).

Assuming constant rates over an age interval, we can derive the following results:

Q(x,0,0) = e720, (2)

It may be noted that in the above formulas, the factor.5 in the exponents stands for
the length of the age interval. When data
are available by, say, 1-year age groups,
the same formulas can be used with § replaced by 1. Obviously, because of the
assumption of constant fertility rates over
an age interval, the formulas will give
more accurate results for narrower age intervals. For a more complex model involving marriage and illegitimacy and

for further breakdown of Q(x,y,3+) into
O(x,¥,3), O(x,9,4), ... , the reader is referred to Das Gupta (1976).

To give numerical illustrations of the
formulas in (2) through (8), let us consider
the age group 25-29, with age-parityspecific fertility rates

m(3,0) = 0.132, m(3,1) = 0.292,
m(3,2) = 0.189. (9)

Substituting these values in (9) into the
formulas in (2) through (8), we obtain

Q(3,0,0) = 0.52, 0(3,0,1) = 0.23,
Q(3,0,2) = 0.18, 0(3,0,3+) = 0.07,
Q(3,1,1) = 0.23, Q(3,1,2) = 0.44,
Q(3,1,3+) = 0.33, Q(3,2,2) = 0.39,

Q(3,2,3+) = 0.61, 0(3,3+,3+) =1. (10

The numbers in (10) are amenable to
clear-cut interpretations. The probability
Q(3,1,2) = 0.44, for example, means that
if a woman of exact age 25 having one
child reproduces in her subsequent
childbearing ages according to the ageparity-soecific fertility rates of white
women in the United States as of 1960, the
probability that she will end up with 2
children at age 30 is 0.44, assuming that
she will survive to this latter age. The
other two possible situations for this particular woman are 1 child and more than 2
children at age 30 with probabilities 0.23
and 0.33, respectively.

In order to construct the fertility tables,
we denote:

R(«w,N y (0) = the expected number of
women J, with parity y at the end of the
age group x, given that at the beginning of
the same age group their numbers by
parities 0,1,2,3+ were Mo, 11, %, %3, and
that everyone survived the five-year interval, y = 0,1,2,3+;

R(x,N y |) = the expected number of
women J, with parity y at the end of the
age group x, given that at the beginning of
the same age group their numbers by
parities 1,2,3+ were n,, M5, m3, and that

everyone survived the five-year interval, y
= 1,2,3+4;

R(x,N,,|2) = the expected number of
women J, with parity y at the end of the
age group x, given that at the beginning of
the same age group their numbers by
parities 2,3+ were n,, nz, and that
everyone survived the five-year interval, y
= 2,3+.

It follows that

R(x, No|0) = oQ(x,0,0), R(x,N, }0)

R(x,N,|0) = 2 9Q(x,0,2)

Considering again the age group 25-29
and the corresponding Q-values in (10),
and assuming three different parity distributions of 100 women at age 25 given by
(1) 29 = 37, ny = 25, my = 24, ng, = 14, (2)
n, = 16, nm, = 40, m3, = 44, and (3) mn, =
29, 23, = 71, we obtain from (11)

R(3,No|0) = 19, R(3,N,|0) = 15,
R(3,N2|0) = 27, R(3,N3,|0) = 39,

The horizontal lines in a fertility table represent the numbers R(x,N, !O),
R(x,N,|1), and R(x,N,|2) with respect to
the n-values in the preceding lines, As a
special case of R-values, the second horizontal line in each block of a fertility table
(divided by 100) gives the probabilities
Q(x,y,z). The age-parity-specific fertility
rates m(x,y) assumed in our computations
are not provided, but one may derive these
rates from the fertility tables by using the
relationships in (2), (6), and (8), that is,

m(x,y) = —logQ(x,¥,y)/5,

y= 0,1,2. (13)

The sources of population and birth data
for the calculation of m(x,y) are indicated
in the footnotes of the fertility tables.

When a cohort of 100 women have the
same age and parity and these are known,
we can read from the fertility tables how
the parity distribution of these women will
change at successive ages as they pass
through their remaining childbearing
years producing children at the ageparity-specific fertility rates for a particular year, assuming that none of them will
die before the end of the childbearing period. Each number in a fertility table has its
own interpretation. For white women in
1960, for example, the number corresponding to age 45 and parity 3+ in Case 2
(with initial cohort age equal to 25) is 60
(Table 4). This figure means that if 100
women of age 25 and parity 1 reproduce in
their subsequent childbearing years according to the age-parity-specific fertility
rates for U.S. white women as of 1960,
and if none of them dies, then, when they
reach age 45, the number of women
among them with parity 3+ is expected to
be 60.

Of particular interest in a fertility table
are the numbers corresponding to the last
horizontal line in each block, which represent the ultimate parity distribution at the

end of the childbearing period, given the
initial (identical) age and parity of the
cohort of 100 women. These last lines for
the diagonally located three blocks from
the fertility tables for a particular race and
year along with the completed cohort parity distributions of women aged 45-49 in
the censuses are shown in Table 1.

RESULTS

From the fertility tables (Tables 2-7)
and, in particular, from the selective
numbers given in Table 1, we may list
some salient findings as follows:

1. Given the parity of a woman, the
tendency on her part to keep it unchanged
(for voluntary and involuntary reasons)
increases with the decrease in the length of
the remaining childbearing years. This is
true not only when we follow her to the
end of the childbearing period (which is
obvious on theoretical ground that the
probability of a birth in a period of time
cannot be less than the probability of a
birth in a section of that period), but also
true in general when we consider a given
length of time in the future. For white
women, 1974, for example, starting at age
20, childlessness reduces to 29 per cent
(Case 1) and one-childness reduces to 8 per
cent (Case 2) in 15 years. But, these percentages corresponding to age 25, for the
same length of time, are respectively 42
and 19 (Table 6). For nonwhite women,
1974, under identical situations, childlessness and one-childness reduce to 35 and 7
per cent corresponding to age 20 and to 51
and 20 per cent, respectively, corresponding to age 25 (Table 6). Although marriage
is not explicitly incorporated into the
model, we may draw an indirect conclusion that the higher age at marriage is
associated with a greater risk of childlessness, even for the same period of exposure.
This finding is in agreement with the re

sults of our earlier study based on women
married once and husband present (Das
Gupta, 1975, Table 4).

2. Childlessness among nonwhite women 45-49, as obtained from the census, has always been higher than the corresponding rate among white women, the
former rate (22 per cent) being about twice
the latter rate (12 per cent) in 1974. But if
women produce children according to
1974 rates, more white than nonwhite
women will end up being childless (21 per
cent for white against 20 per cent for nonwhites). This direction of change is consistent with our earlier results for three decades up to 1960-70 and with our observation that “there is essentially no difference in the extent of childlessness between
white and nonwhite women in the United
States at the present time” (Das Gupta,
1975, Table 3 and p. 141). Childlessness
among nonwhite women may even be
much lower than is indicated by the 1974
period rate because of a considerable
number of births out of wedlock and because of our assumption of zero parity for
single women. This is apparent from a
comparison of childlessness for the year
1970 for which we have also computed the
rate recognizing the parity of single women. For nonwhite women, the latter rate is
8 per cent compared to 17 per cent on the
assumption of zero parity for single women. By contrast, for white women, the
childlessness rate only falls from 15 to 14
per cent by the revised computation based
on parity data for single women (Table 1).

3. For both white and nonwhite wom-.

en, the period percentage of women with 3
or more children has decreased since
1960—from 66 to 27 per cent for whites
and from 67 to 48 per cent for nonwhites
during 1960-74 (Table 1, Case 1). This
reduction has been achieved by a corresponding rise in the percentages of 0-child,
1-child, and 2-child families among both

white and nonwhite women. The census
figures for cohorts aged 45-49 give a
diametrically opposite picture, i.e., for
both white and nonwhite women, there
has been an increase in the percentage of
families with 3 or more children during
1960-74 at the cost of reductions in general in the percentages of O-child, 1-child,
and 2-child families (Table 1, first portion).

4. For the first time in 1974, the period
percentage-parity curve gives a peak at
2-child families for white women (35 per
cent). On the other hand, for nonwhite
women, 3 or more children still seems to
be the norm (48 per cent). However, in the
last twenty-five years, the period percentages of both 0O-child and 1-child families
have also risen along with those of 2-child
families among both white and nonwhite
women, and this may be an indication of
more and more acceptance of childlessness
and one-child families, assuming that
these increases are primarily voluntary.

5. Gradual acceptance of one-child
families is also indicated by the fact that
among women with one child at age 20,
the percentage not having one or more
additional children has risen from 2 to 7
per cent among whites, and from 2 to 6 per
cent among nonwhites during 1960-74.
According to 1974 fertility tables, half of
the white women and one-third of the
nonwhite women who have one child at
age 20 choose not to have more than two
children by the end of their reproductive
period (Table 1, Case 2).

6. The percentage of women who have
two children at age 25 not having any
more children has also increased sharply
during 1960—74—from 19 to 51 per cent
among white women and from 15 to 34 per
cent among nonwhite women (Table 1,
Case 3).

Thus, no matter from which angle we
analyze our results, it is evident from the

fertility tables that both white and nonwhite women have drastically changed
their parity distribution in the course of
the last quarter of a century in favor of
more childless, one-child, and two-child
families, the changes for white women

having been more spectacular than those
for nonwhite women. It should be emphasized that the above findings are only a
few of many such observations that one
can make from the set of fertility tables
presented in this paper.
