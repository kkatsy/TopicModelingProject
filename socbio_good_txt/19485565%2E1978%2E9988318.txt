Menopause in Mothers of Multiple Births and

Mothers of Singletons Only

ABSTRACT: This paper presents data on the age at natural menopause and the prevalence of
operative menopause in mothers of multiple births and in a matched control group of mothers of
singleton children only. The age at natural menopause was significantly earlier among mothers of
multiple births than among mothers of singletons. The prevalence of operative menopause was
slightly higher among mothers of multiple births. Mothers of DZ unlike-sexed twins had significantly higher rates of operative menopause than did women in the comparison group.

The menopause as a subject for scientific study over the past three decades has
been summarized recently by McKinlay
and McKinlay (1973) in their annotated
review of selected studies of the menopause. They comment that with the
development of instruments for describing
populations, such as census data and surveys, there has been growing interest in
describing the health and fertility of populations, that is, with acquiring data which
are basic to any further study of the
menopause. Three main categories of reports are discussed in this review: (a) the
general report of clinical observation of
experience, usually presented with no
data, or with data from vague or unevaluated sources; (6) the survey, generally of a nonclinical population, aimed
primarily at providing descriptive data on
the age at menopause and on symptoms
possibly related to menopause; and (c) the
clinical trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of proposed treatments of
“menopausal” symptoms. In this paper I
shall present data most closely related to
Category (6).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The population surveyed was a group of
mothers of twins and a comparison or
matched control group of mothers of singleton children only. The data are from a
self-administered questionnaire sent to
women recruited through the National
Organization of Mothers of Twins Clubs,
Inc., an organization one of whose major
purposes is to participate in research on
twinning. The organization consists of
about ten thousand mothers of twins and
other multiple births who are members of
some two hundred and fifty local clubs
throughout the United States, from
Hawaii and Alaska to Massachusetts, the
clubs ranging in size from ten to over a
hundred members. The study was designed as an epidemiological study of the
menstrual and reproductive characteristics of mothers who have borne twins in
comparison with women who have had
singleton children only.

Questionnaires seeking information on
menstrual and reproductive history were
mailed to members whose names were

provided by participating local clubs. The
questionnaire was designed to investigate
the relationship between multiple births
and hormonal activity as reflected in
menstrual, reproductive, and obstetrical
characteristics. A matched control group,
with matches selected by the women
themselves, was an essential feature of the
study design, because the usefulness of the
data and the inferences drawn depended
on comparisons with women who had not
borne twins.

The procedure for selecting a match was
described in the following way: “The
‘match’ is to be another mother, friend or
neighbor (not a close relative), approximately the same age and with the same
number of children as yourself, but with
no twins in her own or her immediate
family.” The choice of a match who is a
friend or neighbor is related to the concept
of comparability on subtle personality
traits or “mode of life” and possibly on
general background, including such things
as race, social class, ethnicity, and religion. The procedure, which was found to
be effective, is described fully in an earlier
publication (Detre and Wyshak, 1971).

In this paper I report on the responses of
4,752 mothers of twins or other multiple
births and 4,086 matches who responded
to the questionnaire and whose responses
related to menopause.! Most of the women
were white (over 99 per cent) and middle
class (median schooling completed, about
12 years). The questions relating to menOpause were:

Have you stopped having your regular periods?
Yes No
If yes, is it because of:
A. Change of life (menopause)
B. Operation

 

 

' There are fewer respondents among the matches
than among the mothers of multiple births because
women were asked to return their questionnaires
whether or not they were able to find a suitable
match for themselves.

There is no way of estimating the validity of the answers to these questions.
However, the questions were simple, and
the motivation of the women participating
in the study was high. Membership in the
Mothers of Twins Clubs is in itself an
indication of interest among mothers of
twins in themselves and in research on
twinning. The matches or controls, selected by the mothers of twins, can be
assumed to have been interested in participation. As noted above, the matching
procedure was effective for variables such
as age, number of children, and socioeconomic characteristics. Because the
study was based on voluntary participation and the respondents were self-selected, the sample is not necessarily representative of mothers of twins as a whole
or of mothers of singleton children only.
Nevertheless, the data for the two
groups—mothers of twins or other multiple births and a control group of mothers
of singleton children only—are useful for
comparative purposes.

Numerous methodological problems relating to the eliciting and analysis of data
regarding the menopause have been discussed by McKinlay and McKinlay (1973),
Jaszmann et al. (1969), MacMahon and
Worcester (1966), Zacharias and Wurtman (1969), and Treloar (1974), among
many others. The three main methods are
denoted the retrospective method, the proDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

spective method, and the status-quo
method. The status-quo method of analysis
is the one employed for the analysis of this
data. According to this method, the experience of a cross-section of women over the
range of ages during which menopause may
occur is examined to determine whether or
not menstrual periods have stopped. The
percentages of women at each age who have
stopped menstruating are used to estimate
the mean or median age at menopause and
its standard error. A detailed description of
this method of estimating mean age, known
as probit analysis, is givenin Finney (1971).
For our analysis, BMD 03S, a statistical
program from the Biomedical Computer
programs, 1968, was used (Dixon, 1968).

RESULTS

Table 1 gives full details of the data
analyzed in this paper. Respondents to the
questions regarding menopause are classified by whether or not they are mothers of multiple births, by number and type
of multiple births, by age at the time of the
response, and by menopausal status. The
matched controls are those with zero multiple births.

The comparability in age of mothers of
twins and of controls is evident from this
table. Nearly 57 per cent of the mothers of
twins and 55 per cent of the matched controls were under 35 years. Since very few
women experience menopause at ages less
than 35 years, these women will not be
considered in the subsequent analysis of
age at natural menopause. The median
age among mothers of twins who were at
least 35 years of age was 40.3; for the
matches, 40.0. By twin type, the median
ages of those 35 and over were: like-sexed
twins, 40.3; unlike-sexed twins, 40.5; two
or more sets of twins or other multiple
births, 40.7. The per cent of respondents
in these groups who were under 35 are 58

Many of the respondents were in the
peri-childbearing state and reported a cessation of menstruation because of pregnancy, because they.were in the postpartum period, or because they were
breast-feeding. A smal] number reported
that their periods had ceased for reasons
such as X-ray therapy for cancer, medical

NATURAL MENOPAUSE

The analysis of age at occurrence of
natural menopause or age at which
menstrual periods have ceased was done
using probit analysis.2 Included in the
analysis were women 35 years of age and
older. The women in the study were
classified by their type of offspring into the
following groups: (1) the comparison
group—no multiple births; (2) any multiple
birth; (2a) like-sexed twins; (2b) unlikesexed twins; (2c) two or more sets of twins
or higher order multiple births. The main
findings (Table 2) are as follows.

those respondents whose periods have
ceased because of pregnancy, post-partal
period, or other reasons not related to natural or operative menopause amount to
about 6 per cent of the mothers of multiple
births and 8 per cent of the mothers of
singleton children only.

The results will be discussed in terms of
comparisons between women who are
comparable in age and other sociodemographic characteristics but differin whether
or not they have borne twins. I shall first
discuss differences in age at natural
menopause and then differences in prevalence of operative menopause.

1. Mothers of multiple births have
earlier natural menopause than do women
who have had singleton children only. The
mean ages are 49.36 and 50.60 years, respectively, with a mean difference and

2 The superiority of the status-quo method (which
can be done with probit analysis or logit analysis) is
demonstrated with these data. Using the retrospective method of analysis, i-e., comparing average age
at menopause from the age at which menopause was
reported, yielded no significant differences among
the groups compared. In the study reported here we
also sought information retrospectively about
menarche. Small but significant differences were
found between mothers of twins and mothers of singletons only. Gedda (1961) reported that Skerlj in
1939 (noreference given) observed that early menarche
was linked with a higher frequency of twin maternities.

standard error of 1.24 +0.466 (Z = 2.67,p
< 0.01). Thus, the mean difference in age
at natural menopause between mothers of
multiple births and mothers of singletons
only is highly significant.

2. Mothers of unlike-sexed twins have
earlier natural menopause than do mothers of like-sexed twins. The respective
means are 47.99 and 49.77 years, the
mean difference and its standard error
being 1.78 + 0.637 (Z = 2.80, p < 0.01).

© a highly significant difference.

3. Mothers of two or more sets of
® twins or higher order multiple births—
triplets or quads—have an age at men© opause which is intermediate between
mothers of like-sexed and unlike-sexed
twins, 48.76 + 1.01.

4, The difference in mean age at
menopause between mothers of like-sexed
= twins and mothers of singletons is not sigS nificant, 49.77 versus 50.60 years, with a
difference of 0.83 + 0.463 (Z = 1.79).
‘S Like-sexed twins are comprised of both
‘S dizygotic (DZ) twins and monozygotic
(MZ) twins, in the ratio of 1:2 approxi= mately. DZ twins are borne by women
2 believed to have a genetic tendency to
~ multiple births while MZ twins are not
= believed to be genetically determined but
gy to occur by chance. Thus, one would ex'S pect the experiences of the mothers of
= like-sexed twins to be a combination of
= that for mothers of DZ twins and mothers
© of singleton children only. Based on a ratio

of one-third DZ and two-thirds MZ, and

assuming that the DZ experience is like
that of the mothers of unlike-sexed twins

(47.99 years) and that the MZ experience

is like that of the mothers of singletons

only (50.60 years), the weighted average is

49.73 years. In fact, the mean for the en
tire group of mothers of like-sexed twins is

49.77 years.

5. Some of the respondents stated
whether their like-sexed twins were fraternal (DZ) oridentical (MZ). Although the

reliability of the responses relating to
zygosity cannot be assessed, like-sexed
twins were classified as “DZ,” “MZ,” or
“Not specified.” Comparison of mothers of
like-sexed fraternal twins and mothers of
identical twins shows that the mothers of
the former group have a slightly lower age
at natural menopause than do mothers in
the latter group (49.62 vs. 49.81). The direction of the difference is consistent with
that found above with respect to the
mothers of unlike-sexed (DZ) and likesexed (MZ and DZ) twins, although the
magnitude of the difference is not significant.

6. Finally, the difference in mean age
at natural menopause for mothers of
unlike-sexed twins and mothers of singletons only is ~2.61 years (47.99-50.60), the
largest difference observed, with a standard error of 0.639 (Z = 4.08, p < 0.001).

The means and standard errors cited
above are given in Table 2. In addition,
Table 3, derived from the computer printout, gives estimates of the other parameters of the probit regressions line and
their standard errors. Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests are also given to determine whether the observed distributions
conform to a normal curve.

OPERATIVE MENOPAUSE

Operative menopause denotes the cessation of menstruation as the result of an
operation (surgical in contrast to natural
menopause). In Table 4 the prevalence of
operative menopause is given by age and
by type of birth. Both numerators and
denominators in Table 4 exclude women
who reported having had a natural
menopause. Over all ages, we note that
women who have borne only singleton
children have a lower prevalence of operative menopause than do women who
have had at least one multiple birth, the
difference being one-half of one per cent.

We further note that women who have

had like-sexed twins have a lower prevalence than do women who have had
unlike-sexed twins, 4.7 per cent compared
with 5.3 per cent. Mothers of more than
one set of twins or of higher order multiple
births also have a lower prevalence than
do mothers of unlike-sexed twins. Although the percentages are not based on
large numbers, the proportion listing operative menopause is higher in five out of
six age groups among mothers of multiple
births than among the matches (no multiple births). Similarly, in five out of six age
groups, mothers of unlike-sexed twins
have had more operative surgery than did
mothers of like-sexed twins. If there are
genetic or hormonal differences between
women who have borne unlike-sexed (DZ)
twins and women who have borne likesexed twins (some MZ and some DZ), one
would expect the experience of mothers of
like-sexed twins to be more like that of
mothers of singleton children. This inference is based on the well-accepted premise
that MZ twinning is not genetically determined but is a chance event, while DZ
twinning is a maternal recessive trait
(Bulmer, 1970; Wyshak and White, 1965).

The mothers of singletons only and the
mothers of DZ or unlike-sexed twins in the
present study constitute the most disparate
groups. For these two groups we find that
in every age group the prevalence of operative menopause is higher among the
women who have had unlike-sexed twins.
Based on the sign test, we can conclude
that there is a significant difference between these groups with respect to the
prevalence of operative menopause (p =
0.031).

DISCUSSION

An association that comes to mind from
the results on age at occurrence of natural
menopause and prevalence of operative
menopause is that mothers of unlike-sexed
twins compared with the other mothers,
have an experience similar to that of Black
women compared with white women.

tive menopause than do white women, 16
per cent vs. 13 per cent.

It is well known that Black women have
higher DZ twinning rates than do white
women (Bulmer, 1970). Wyshak and
White (1965) have shown that women who
are themselves DZ twins or the female sibs
of DZ twins have high DZ twinning rates
(based on twinning among their offspring),
compared with wives of male DZ twins
and wives of male sibs of DZ twins. Their
conclusion is that DZ twinning is a maternal recessive trait. In general populations,
DZ twinning rates increase by maternal
age up to ages 35-39 and then decline.
However, Wyshak (1975) has shown that
the DZ twinning rate among women who
are DZ twins or the female sibs of DZ
twins remains high through 40—44 years of
age. Reports on Black women also show
that their DZ twinning rate remains high
beyond 35-39 years of age and does not
show a marked decline until after ages
40-44. It has been postulated by Bulmer
(1970) and Czeizel and Acsadi (1971) that
high DZ twinning rates may be associated
with later age at menopause. In fact, our
results seem to point to the converse. High
DZ twinning rates and, in particular, high
rates at later ages, seem to be found in
women with earlier ages at natural menopause. |

Bulmer (1970, p. 81) claims that the
increase in the DZ twinning rate from zero
at menarche to its maximum at about 37
years of age may be due to increasing secretion of gonadotrophin; and the sharp
fall in the DZ twinning rate from its maximum at age 37 back to zero at menopause
is probably a consequence of failing ovarian function as menopause approaches.
He further states that since the menopause
itself is caused by the cessation of ovarian
function when the ovaries run out of follicles, it is not unreasonable to suppose that
the menopause is preceded by a period of

waning ovarian function when the ovaries
are unable to respond fully to gonadotrophic stimulation because they are beginning to run short of follicles.

Our findings seem to negate Bulmer’s
hypothesis. For women who are DZ twins
(or their female sibs) and for Black women, the twinning rate does not decline
sharply after age 37, but rather remains
high into the 40’s. Yet, for these two
groups of women, the menopause is
slightly earlier (for DZ twins or their female sibs, earlier than for women in the
general population; for Black women,
earlier than for white women). One can
postulate from these findings that prior to
the menopause, due to genetic or hormonal factors or an interaction of the two,
there is an increase in ovarian activity
which leads to double ovulation and dizygotic twinning.

While the primary purpose of this paper
has been to provide descriptive data for
comparing menopause in selected groups
of women, the findings lead to a hypothesis about the cancer experience of mothers
of dizygotic twins. Nylander (1973) found
that Yoruba women who have borne
twins have higher levels of gonadotrophin.
Our work (Wyshak, 1975) suggests that
women who have had DZ twins have high
hormonal levels. Postulating a higher level
of gonadotrophins in mothers of DZ twins,
Currie (1967) investigated the prevalence
of breast cancer among mothers of DZ
twins and a matched control group of
mothers of singletons only. He found essentially no difference in the occurrence of
breast cancer in the two groups; the relative risk was 1.1.

We hypothesize that mothers of DZ
twins may show different patterns in the
occurrence of cancer of the corpus uteri.
Our reasoning is based on the following:
Similarities have been observed between
mothers of DZ twins and Black women

with respect to twinning at the end of the
reproductive span, earlier natural menopause, and a higher prevalence of
operative menopause. U.S. mortality rates
indicate that cancer of the corpus uteri is
higher among Negro women than among
white women. For malignant neoplasm of
the corpus uteri (ICD 172), of other parts
of the uterus including chorionepithelioma
(ICD 173), and of uterus unspecified (ICD
174), mortality rates are 6.13 for white
females and 11.30 for nonwhite females
(U.S. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare, 1974). Wynder et al. (1966)
remarked about the lack of any reliable
figures on racial differences in endometrial
cancer, but found in his series the proportion of Blacks “somewhat higher than expected.” Qur examination of Currie’s
(1967) data revealed that the relative risk
for cancer of the corpus uteri was 2.75 (p
= 0.059 one-tailed, p = 0.118 two-tailed)
for mothers of DZ twins as compared with
the matched control group which consisted of mothers of singletons only. Although Currie’s series did not show a
statistically significant difference, we feel
that the hypothesis that the occurrence of
cancer of the corpus uteri is greater in
mothers of DZ twins than in the general
population warrants further investigation.

SUMMARY

Descriptive data useful for comparing
the age at natural menopause and the incidence of operative menopause in mothers of multiple births and mothers of singleton children only have been presented.
The data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires sent to women who
are members of the National Organization
of Mothers of Twins Clubs, Inc. Information regarding the menstrual and reproductive histories of the women was
sought. Each club member selected a

mother of singleton children only to serve
as a matched control and to respond to the
same questionnaire.

The age at natural menopause is significantly earlier in women having had
multiple births than in women in the comparison group. Using probit analysis, we
found that the mean ages and standard
errors are 49.4 + 0.28 for mothers of multiple births and 50.6 + 0.37 for mothers of
singleton children only. The prevalence of
