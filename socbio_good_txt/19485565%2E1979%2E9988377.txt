Barriers to Acceptance of Genetic Counseling

Among Primary Care Physicians

ABSTRACT: This research analyzed physicians’ attitudes toward and use of genetic counseling. Data
were obtained through mailed questionnaires sent to all 445 general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and obstetrician-gynecologists in private practice and involved in direct patient care in
Maricopa and Pima Counties, Arizona. Results indicated strong attitudinal support for genetic
counseling. Almost all respondents felt that it was a useful and necessary medical service, and most
felt that it resulted in more responsible patient decisions. Actual genetic counseling by physicians
was comparatively rare, however. The data suggested that the paucity of counseling may have derived from a lack of training in genetics, scarcity of patient requests, and legal naiveté. Genetic
counseling, amniocentesis, and abortion received the most support from younger physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists, and those who were Jewish, less religious, and had few or no children.

Since the beginning of this century,
massive changes have occurred in the distribution and extent of diseases. Infectious diseases have decreased in importance due to public health campaigns,
gradual improvements in the standard of
living for most Americans, and medical
advances such as the various antibiotics
and vaccines. At the same time, medicine
has developed technology which has reduced mortality rates for both defective
infants and the elderly. As the incidence
of infectious disease decreases, while survival rates for those with genetic conditions increase, we can expect that genetic
disease will form a growing share of all
medical problems.

Awareness of this epidemiological
change has in recent years led both government agencies and individual physicians to begin to refocus their energies in
order better to combat genetic disease.
For some genetic diseases, such as phenylketonuria, reasonably effective treatment

exists. No true cures for genetic disease
will be available, however, unless and until: genetic manipulation becomes technically—and legally—feasible. In the meantime, the best tools at our disposal are
screening individuals at risk to determine
their genetic status and providing genetic
counseling when appropriate in order to
prevent the birth of genetically defective
infants and in order rapidly to identify and
treat those who are born.

Genetic counseling is a relatively new
area in medicine,'as witnessed by the fact
that it only received a separate listing in
Index Medicus as of 1973. As with most innovations, we can assume that genetic
counseling will face a certain amount of
resistance, among both physicians and patients. A number of researchers (e.g. Kaback et al., 1974; Becker et al., 1975;
Childs et al., 1976) have studied characteristics of patients who volunteer for

‘However, it has historic roots in the eugenics
movement of the early twentieth century.

genetic screening programs. However,
even with the most willing patients,
genetic screening and genetic counseling
cannot occur unless primary practitioners
will either counsel patients or will refer
them to counselors and screening programs. A review of the literature uncovered a few questions on physicians’ attitudes in a government report on genetic
screening programs (Committee for the
Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism,
1975) but only one previous study (Naylor, 1975) which focused on physicians’ attitudes toward such programs. The following research report, using a somewhat
broader and larger sample than Naylor’s
in a different geographical region, analyzes attitudes toward and use of genetic
counseling by various primary practitioners and discusses the barriers to physician acceptance of this medical innovation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For this study, a survey was conducted
of all 445 general and family practitioners
(GP’s), pediatricians, and obstetriciangynecologists (OBG’s) in Maricopa and
Pima Counties, Arizona, who were in
private practice and involved in direct patient care. These two counties, centering
around the cities of Phoenix and Tucson,
contain 74 per cent of Arizona’s population and 85 per cent of its physicians.?
Names were obtained from the 1979 directories of the American Medical Association and the Arizona Board of Medical
Examiners. Physicians who worked for
health maintenance organizations, hospitals, or the government were not included,
since their behavior might merely reflect

administrative mandates rather than their
own beliefs.

Data were obtained during July and
August of 1979 by means of a mailed questionnaire. Persons who did not respond to
the first mailing received a second copy of
the questionnaire after three weeks, anda
third copy three weeks later. By the end of
the three mailings 69 per cent of the population (307 individuals) had completed a
questionnaire.

RESULTS
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

Respondents did not differ from nonrespondents with regard to sex, board
certification, or specialty; no further information on nonrespondents was available.
Almost all respondents were Caucasian
(98 per cent of sample), male (95 per
cent), and married (89 per cent). (Sex and
race were therefore eliminated as potential variables.) Average age was 50;
average year of medical school graduation
was 1956. Eighty-four per cent belonged
to the American Medical Association
compared to about 50 per cent of physicians nationwide (Stroman, 1976), perhaps
reflecting a more traditionalist orientation
among Arizona physicians. Solo practitioners accounted for 53 per cent of the respondents. Most of the group practices
were fairly small, with an average of 2.6
physicians per group. The physicians in
this sample reflected the conservative
views of Arizonans in general. Seventy
per cent described their political views as
moderately or very conservative, and 69
per cent considered religion somewhat important or very important in their lives.

(GC). Ninety per cent believed that GC
results in more responsible reproductive
decisions, and 82 per cent felt that such information should be offered as part of regular prenatal and family planning (cf.
Naylor, 1975). Ninety-three per cent
agreed with the statement that “GC is
both a useful and necessary medical service.”

The provision of amniocentesis (which
significantly affects the potential usefulness of GC) also found general support
among the respondents. Most felt that amniocentesis would be a good idea if a
genetic disorder had already appeared ina
family (86 per cent agreeing in the case of
Down’s syndrome, and 89 per cent agreeing when Tay-Sachs was a possibility).
More than half (61 per cent) favored advising amniocentesis for all pregnant patients over age 35. However, amniocentesis to satisfy parental curiosity about the
sex of a fetus was strongly rejected; only 2
per cent considered it a good idea.

Ifa genetic defect was found, the physiclans generally agreed that abortion might
be appropriate. Only 4 per cent rejected
abortion categorically. Seventy-four per
cent felt it would be a good idea if a fetus
was diagnosed as having Tay-Sachs syndrome, 65 per cent if Down’s syndrome
was the diagnosis, but only 47 per cent if
Turner’s syndrome was evident.

As Table 1 shows, all three of these
medical services (GC, amniocentesis, and
abortion) found the most support among
Jewish physicians and the least support
among Catholic physicians.? Amniocentesis and abortion were both judged most favorably by those with few or no children
and by those who did not consider religion
very important in their lives (Tables 2 and
3). Age significantly affected only attitude
to GC, with younger physicians exhibiting

more approval (Table 4). Physicians in the
various specialties did not differ significantly on their attitudes to GC and amniocentesis, but pediatricians were significantly less supportive of abortion than
were OBG’s and GP’s (Table 5).

Factors AFFECTING THE USE OF
GENETIC COUNSELING

Compared to the level of attitudinal
support for GC, reported GC behavior
was relatively low.* Twenty-one per cent
reported that they or their assistants frequently counseled patients regarding the
possibility of Down’s syndrome, but only
9 per cent reported frequently counseling
regarding genetic disorders other than
Down’s. One-fifth reported that neither
they nor their assistants had ever provided
any GC.° Younger physicians and OBG’s
provided GC significantly more frequently than did others (Table 6 and 7).

The data suggested a few possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy
between attitudinal support and actual
counseling behavior. The next few paragraphs will discuss the effects of four factors—patient requests, physician training,
legal naiveté, and referral to professional
counselors—on frequency of GC by primary practitioners.°

It appears from the data that unless patients requested GC, physicians rarely
offered such services. Of those who frequently received requests, 56 per cent frequently referred patients to a genetic

“This has to remain a rather subjective and abstract statement, since there is no way of knowing
how frequently counseling would occur in an “ideal”
situation.

*Unfortunately, it is impossible to make any comparisons to Naylor’s data, since he combined those
doctors who provided GC with those who had been
asked to provide GC.

°For this purpose, GC behavior was measured
by a summary scale, which averaged frequency of
counseling regarding Down’s syndrome with frequency of counseling regarding any other genetic disease,

counselor and the same percentage frequently provided GC themselves. By contrast, among those who had never received such a request, only 3 per cent had
ever referred and only 1 per cent had ever
themselves provided GC. Patient requests
for these services occurred rather infrequently. Despite recent media coverage,
23 per cent of the physicians had never
been asked to provide GC, and 39 percent
reported rarely receiving such a request.
Only 8 per cent overall (but 27 per cent of
the OBG’s) frequently received requests
for such services.

Another possible explanation for the
infrequency of counseling by physicians
may be the physicians’ lack of knowledge
of genetics. The need for such training was
clearly recognized; fully 95 per cent believed that education in GC should be
offered as a regular part of medical training. In actual fact, however, fewer than
one-third of the respondents (30 per cent)
had taken a course in genetics during medical school, and only 31 per cent of the
OBG’s (16 per cent overall) had any training in that subject during their internship
or residency.’

The extent of training was significantly

"These statistics appear in line with national
trends. Sorensen and Culbert (1977) found that only
60 per cent of accredited medical schools in the
United States offered a course in clinical genetics,
and 75 per cent of these courses were given as electives.

correlated with both counseling and referring. Eighteen per cent of those who received training in genetics during medical
school and postgraduate education frequently counseled, compared to 6 per cent
of those without such training. Almost
identical proportions frequently referred
patients to genetic counselors. However,
these data cannot tell us whether increased education produced increased
support for GC, or whether those who
were more interested in GC sought out
such training. |

Legal naiveté also may explain the limited amount of counseling by primary
practitioners.* Although 71 per cent believed that some clients could probably or
definitely bring a successful suit against
their doctors for not providing GC, only
one-third (32 per cent) of the physicians
overall (but twice as many OBG’s) had
heard of such a case. Cases of this sort
have, in fact, occurred in New York and
California.

Doctors who knew of successful suits,
as well as those who simply believed in the
possibility of such a suit, were more likely
than others to provide GC and to refer patients to professional genetic counselors.

®This research was originally planned for California. Plans were changed when protests indicated that
fear of malpractice suits among California physicians
overwhelmed the effects of any other variables. It
was hoped that this fear might be less severe in
another geographical region.

Vol. 26, No. 3

Of those who knew of such cases, 17 per
cent frequently counseled patients, and 19
per cent frequently referred patients to
counselors, compared to 2 per cent and 4
per cent of those who did not have such
knowledge. Again, though, the data cannot show whether fear of legal action produced counseling behavior or whether
those who were most committed to GC
kept up with the literature and therefore
had read of such cases.

One explanation that did not hold up
under scrutiny was the hypothesis that primary physicians did not provide counseling because they instead referred patients
to professional genetic counselors. Despite the fact that 76 per cent knew of at
least one GC center in the state, only 9 per
cent frequently referred patients to a
genetic counselor, and 25 per cent had
never referred anyone to a counselor (cf.
Naylor, 1975).° Of those who had never
themselves counseled patients regarding
any genetic disease, 63 per cent had never
referred a patient to a genetic counselor,
while more than half (57 per cent) of those
who frequently counseled had also frequently referred patients to counselors.
Referrals were significantly more common among pediatricians or GP’s (among
whom 7 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, frequently made referrals).

CONCLUSIONS AND
IMPLICATIONS

A variety of conclusions and implications can be drawn from this research.
First, the research indicated a level of support for GC considerably greater and
more widespread than this researcher had

*This lack of referrals cannot be explained by perceived economic barriers. Physicians who believed
that their patients had insurance which would pay for
a session with a genetic counselor were no more
likely than other physicians to make such referrals.

expected. The region studied is heavily
Republican, quite conservative, has a
strong Mormon influence, and an active
anti-abortion lobby. This researcher
therefore assumed that not only abortion,
but any behavior such as GC or amniocentesis which might result in abortion would
also meet strong opposition. For this same
reason, some informed members of the local medical community considered this
project simply unfeasible when originally
suggested. Instead, the study attained a 69
per cent response rate and showed overwhelming attitudinal support for GC.
These results indicate that policy-makers
(particularly those in more liberal regions)
may take a more aggressive stand in promoting genetic services, since they will
probably have the support of local physicians.

Second, this research confirms that not
only medical factors (e.g. diagnosis, medical specialty) but social factors as well
affect physician attitudes toward and use
of GC, amniocentesis, and abortion. In
general, those who were Jewish, less religious, had few or no children, and/or were
younger (independent of political views
and year of graduation) were more accepting of these medical innovations. This
conclusion suggests that physician support
for genetic services depends more upon a
sort of personal or ‘“‘life style” liberalism
than on political liberalism. Further investigation into the relative impact of “‘personal politics” versus legalistic politics
would certainly be warranted.

Third, the study found that patients
rather infrequently request GC. This finding suggests that the general population
has only limited knowledgé regarding the
nature and the availability of genetic services. Clearly no reason exists why the
general ideas of genetics (at the level of
knowledge required of prospective patients) cannot be more widely understood.
At the action level, therefore, persons

196

committed to these services should begin
investigating high-school and college curricula and working to educate marriage
counselors and clergy in order to further
disseminate this information. Researchers
should begin collecting data on knowledge
of genetics and genetic services among the
general population, and on barriers to
general acceptance of these services. To
date, the only studies on knowledge of
genetics among the general population
have occurred in the wake of mass education campaigns rather than among the
naive public (e.g. Kaback et al., 1974;
Becker et al., 1975; Childs et al., 1976).

Fourth, this study points to the need for
involving pediatricians and GP’s in
genetic services. Apparently, in the geographic area studied, the bulk of the responsibility for counseling and for referrals falls on OBG’s. Unfortunately, many
women never consult an OBG, while
others do so only when pregnancy is far
advanced. Additionally, if genetic disease
is not detected until after birth, reliance
on even the best of OBG’s may be
insufficient for ensuring the provision of
necessary genetic information. Therefore,
a need clearly exists for involving other
primary practitioners in GC. Encouragement and education coming from local
and national pediatrics, general practice,
and family practice associations would
probably be most effective at this point.

Fifth, the study clearly demonstrates
both real and perceived need for further
training in clinical genetics among primary
practitioners. Confirming a national
trend, few of these respondents, even
those in OBG, had received any training
in genetics during their medical education. Both medical school training in
genetics and continuing medical education are required in order to educate current and future physicians about this increasingly important area.

Weitz

Social Biology

Finally, while the data suggested a
number of reasons (described above) why
physicians may hesitate to provide GC,
they also left many questions unanswered.
One important hypothesis which remains
to be tested is that physicians do not provide GC because such behavior represents
an innovation which departs from general
medical norms (Sorensen, 1974).

GC differs from traditional medical
practice in at least three major ways. First,
GC depends not only on understanding
the patient’s physical state, but also on
sensitivity to the patient’s emotional
needs and moral standards. Such behavior
falls outside of the affectively neutral
realm for which physicians in general are
trained (Parsons, 1951; Freidson, 1970).
Second, GC consists primarily of supplying preventive information to the patient,
not of actively treating either disease or a
“‘diseased”’ gene. Medical norms, on the
other hand, orient physicians towards active intervention, rather than prevention
of disease. Third, in the ideal counseling
situation, the physician supplies knowledge so that the client can make an informed decision. This contrasts sharply
with general medical norms, which stress
that good medical practice consists of professional experts making knowledgeable
decisions based on their own clinical
judgement.

Past research on innovation by physicians has focused solely on physician acceptance of new drugs (e.g., Coleman et
al., 1966; Williamson, 1975). Use of new
drugs, however, conforms to the general
medical model of prescription to treat illness. Such behavior does not require any
changes in physicians’ value structures.
Future analysis of the data from this study
will investigate the comparative effect of
medical norms on use of both new drugs
and genetic counseling, two rather
different types of medical innovations.
