A Multivariate Regression Analysis of Differences
in Fertility of United States Counties

Two major methods have been used to
study correlates of cross-sectional fertility
differences: (1) the correlation of various
personal characteristics with individual
fertility, and (2) the correlation of average
characteristics of population aggregates
with the average fertility of these aggregates. The great bulk of cross-sectional
fertility research has been by way of the
individual method. Research on the aggregative level has probably been impeded by
the valid and widely publicized warnings
of Robinson (1950) that inferences concerning individual correlations could not
necessarily be inferred from knowledge of
correlations at the aggregative level. Nonetheless, despite Robinson’s admonition,
knowledge of correlations at the aggregative
level may be as important as data concerning associations at the individual level. For
example, the policy-maker charged with
reducing the birth rate in a given area must
be cognizant of the factors likely to affect
the success of the program for the area asa
whole and therefore must know the matrix
of correlations on the level of the aggregates
with which he deals,

Moreover, a policy-maker would be
incorrect in assuming that a knowledge of

 

 

the multivariate regression of individual
characteristics upon a dependent variable
for individuals in some broad aggregate
(such as a nation) coupled with knowledge
of these characteristics for individuals in a
particular smaller area (such as a county)
would necessarily be sufficient to predict
the values of the dependent variable for the
individuals of the particular small subaggregate. Making such an assumption involves
the “atomistic fallacy” (Riley, 1963). For
example, Duncan (1964) has shown from
data of the Indianapolis study that the average number of children ever born to women
of each economic class among couples residing in a residential area of given socioeconomic status depends upon the status of
that residential area as well as upon the economic status of the couple. Specifically, poor
couples in high-status neighborhoods had
fewer children than poor couples in lowstatus neighborhoods; similarly rich couples
in high-status neighborhoods had fewer children than rich couples in low-status neighborhoods, Therefore, in obtaining an accurate prediction of the average number of
children ever born to women residing ina
neighborhood of given socioeconomic status,
it is not enough to know simply the overall

relation for all residential areas of individual
economic status and fertility, but rather the
relation between individual economic status and fertility specific to the status level of
the neighborhood for which fertility is to be
predicted.

Obviously, neither the traditional individual analysis nor the traditional aggregative
analysis is sufficient to give us a complete
picture of the determinants of fertility behavior. A complete analysis, which Riley
(1963) terms a social-system analysis, requires data for each individual on every
relevant individual variable and on every
relevant variable of each group to which
that individual belongs. Unfortunately, we
are still a long way from having knowledge
of this sort concerning fertility behavior.

Previous studies correlating average characteristics of population aggregates with
their average fertility have used four different types of aggregate as the unit of analysis. Whole nations served as the units of
analysis in studies by Weintraub (1962),
Adelman (1963), Russett (1964), Heer
(1966), and Friedlander and Silver (1967).
Subnational areal units were analyzed in
Leasure’s study of provinces of Spain
(1963), Heer’s study of local areas in Peru,
Bolivia, and Ecuador (1964), Heer and
Turner’s study of local areas in Latin
American countries (1965), Collver, Speare,
and Liu’s study of townships in Taiwan
(1967), Schultz’s study of municipios in
Puerto Rico (1967), and Mazur’s study of
urban and rural parts of oblasts in the
U.S.S.R. (1968).

A semiterritorial aggregate was used by
Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant (1969), who
analyzed the correlates of cumulative fertility in 1960 for urban, rural-nonfarm, and
rural-farm white persons in each county of
the United States and of the four regions of
the United States, and also the correlates of
fertility for urban, rural-nonfarm, and ruralfarm nonwhites in each county of the South.
Finally, a nonterritorial aggregate was em

ployed by Mazur (1967) in his study of fertility among ethnic groups in the U.S.S.R.

In general, one cannot necessarily expect
the type of association revealed for one type
of population aggregate to hold for another
type of aggregate (Duncan, Cuzzort, and
Duncan, 1961). For example, the pattern
of relationship between certain independent
variables and fertility found when the nations of Latin America were the units of
analysis might differ from the pattern when
the subnational units of each Latin American
nation were the units of analysis. Discrepant
patterns will exist whenever the variability
of independent variables or the dependent
variable differs with the type of aggregate
taken as the unit of analysis.

DEFINITION OF VARIABLES

In the present study, eight independent
variables were correlated with one measure
of fertility. The independent variables were:
(1) the level of infant mortality in or around
1960, (2) the proportion of the total population in 1960 which was nonwhite, (3) the
median income of males among all males
with income in 1959, (4) the median number
of years of schooling completed by persons
25 years old and over in 1960, (5) the proportion of women 14 years old and over in
the labor force in 1960, (6) the log,) of the
population potential of the county in 1960,
(7) the ratio of males 20 to 54 years old to
females 15 to 49 years old in 1960, and (8)
the 1960 proportion of the total population
Roman Catholic in the archdiocese or diocese in which the county was located. All of
the population data used in the calculation
of the dependent variable and the first
seven independent variables were obtained
from materials published in United States
Census of Population: 1960 (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1963), or Vital Statistics of the
United States (U.S. Public Health Service,
1957-1967). Data on the Roman Catholic
population of each archdiocese and diocese
in the United States in 1960 were obtained

182 Heer and Boynton

from the Official Catholic Directory, 1960,
and on the total population in 1960 of each
archdiocese or diocese from the Official Catholic Directory, 1961.

Fertility in or around 1960 was measured
in terms of a ratio of actual to expected
births—a standardized fertility ratio identical in form to the well-known standard
mortality ratio. This standardized fertility
ratio allows one to measure fertility differences other than those caused by differences
in age composition. The expected births
for each county were computed by summing
over each five-year age group from 15 to 49
years of age the product of the number of
women in the five-year age group in the
county in 1960 and the specific fertility rate
for that five-year age group in the United
States as a whole in 1960. The actual number of births used in the numerator of the
ratio was derived as follows. If the number
of births in the county in 1960 was 500 or
more, the number of births in 1960 was considered the actual number of births. If the
number of births in the county in 1960 was
100 to 499, a three-year average of births
centered on 1960 was considered to be the
actual number. If the number of births in
1960 was 50 to 99, a seven-year average
centered on 1960 was considered to be the
actual number; and if the number of births
in 1960 was less than 50, an eleven-year
average centered on 1960 was taken as the
actual number.

The level of infant mortality was measured by the ratio of infant deaths in 1960
to births in 1960 for those counties where the
number of births in 1960 was 500 or more.
Where the number of births in 1960 was
less than 500, three-year, seven-year, and
eleven-year averages centered on 1960 were
computed for both infant deaths and births,
and the ratio of these averages defined as
the level of infant mortality.

The concept of population potential may
not be known to all readers, A brief explanation is therefore in order. Population poten

tial at any given place 7 can be defined as
follows:

where V; is equal to the population potential at place 7; P; is equal to the population
of a place in set 7 of places to be considered,
and r;; is the distance from that place in set
yj to the reference place 1. The reference
place 7 is always one of the places in set j.
Therefore, population potential measures
not only the population density of the place
itself but also the population density of all
other places in the universe to be considered,
each of these other places being weighted by
the reciprocal of its distance from the place
of reference, Asa result, places with relatively low population density but contiguous
to places of high population density have
relatively high population potential compared to areas of similar population density
situated away from areas of high population
density. Moreover, areas of high population
density situated away from other populated
areas will have relatively low population
potential compared to densely populated
areas contiguous to other dense areas.

Figure 1 reprints a map of equal contours
of population potential for conterminous
United States in 1960 prepared by assuming
that the 3,105 counties in conterminous
United States constitute the 2 places in setj
(Warntz, 1964). Apart from the local peaks
surrounding large cities, it can be seen that
the highest levels of population potential
exist in the megalopolis from Boston to
Washington, D.C.

The value of population potential for
each county in the present study was kindly
supplied by Warntz and is identical in each
case to the value used by Warntz in preparing the map shown in Figure 1. A detailed
description of the computation procedures
is contained in Warntz (1964). It should be
reiterated that population potential, both

ent study, considers in set 7 only areas within the conterminous United States. If all
places in the world had been considered as
belonging to set 7, the population potential
of every part of the United States would
have been increased, but each part would
not share equally in the increase. In particular, there would have been substantial
increases in the population potential of those
areas Close to densely populated portions of
Canada or Mexico and considerably smaller
increases in other parts of the United States.

The proportion of Roman Catholics as
calculated from data of the Official Catholic
Directory, 1960 is slightly less than the proportion of persons who reported their religious preference as Roman Catholic in the
March 1957 Current Population Survey
(United States Bureau of the Census, 1958).
According to the Official Catholic Directory
data on number of Roman Catholics (including those in the military ordinariate),
the proportion of the United States population which was Roman Catholic in January,
1960, was 22.9%. According to the 1957
Current Population Survey, when related
children under 14 years of age were counted
according to the religion of their mother,
26.3% of the United States population
stated “Roman Catholic’ when asked
‘What is your religion?”

A possible alternative for measuring the
proportion Roman Catholic in each county
was to utilize data published for each
county in Churches and Church Membership
in the United States (National Council of
Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., 1957).
For counties in archdioceses and dioceses
containing about 53% of the Roman Catholic population of the United States, these
Roman Catholic proportions had as their
numerator officially reported figures on the
number of Roman Catholics as of January
1, 1953 and for their denominator the county population from the 1950 census. For
counties in the remaining dioceses the figures on Roman Catholic membership were

Social Biology

estimated on the basis of the Roman Catholic membership in the county as reported
in the 1936 Census of Religious Bodies (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1941) and the Roman
Catholic membership in the archdiocese or
diocese in 1953. Although this formula is a
reasonable one, it gives very poor results in
several cases because the data from the 1936
census of religious bodies were so inaccurate.
For example, Churches and Church Membership in the United States reports many of the
counties in Texas to have Roman Catholic
proportions greater than 100% and one
county, Kinney, as 209.9% Roman Catholic.
Since the proportions Roman Catholic in
Churches and Church Membership in the
United States were (a) out of date, (d)
computed from a numerator pertaining to
one year and a denominator pertaining to
another and (c) egregiously inaccurate in
some instances, it was decided not to make
use of them,

USE OF PRESENT INDEPENDENT VARIABLES OR THEIR COGNATES IN PREVIOUS STUDIES OF AREAL FERTILITY
DIFFERENCES

The level of infant mortality has been
shown to be positively associated with fertility in previous multivariate analyses of
national fertility differences by Weintraub
(1962), by Heer (1966), and by Friedlander
and Silver (1967). In the studies conducted
by Weintraub and by Heer, infant mortality
showed a stronger standardized regression
coefficient with respect to fertility than any
of the other variables included in the analysis, The study by Collver, Speare, and Liu
(1967) of fertility differences among 361
townships in Taiwan showed the crude
death rate, with which the level of infant
mortality is highly correlated, to have a
substantial positive correlation with fertility. A study by Knodel and Van de Walle
(1967) of areal fertility differences in nineteenth century Bavaria showed a positive
correlation between the level of infant

Vol. 17, No. 3

mortality and marital fertility both within
areas where breast-feeding was common and
in areas where it was not. Finally, in a multivariate study of the association between
death rates and birth rates for municipios in
Puerto Rico, Schultz (1967) showed, after
control for other variables, that both the
death rate of the previous year and that of
the two years previous were positively associated with the birth rate of the current year;
however, the association was considerably
stronger with respect to the former than the
latter.

The percentage nonwhite has apparently not been previously correlated with
fertility in a multivariate analysis. However, a positive zero-order correlation has
been demonstrated for the counties of the
United States (Kiser, Grabill, Campbell,
1968).

Multivariate studies of national fertility
differences by Weintraub (1962), by Adelman (1963), and by Heer (1966) have
shown positive partial associations between
areal differences in income and in fertility,
although the zero-order correlations between these two variables were in all cases
negative. The similar study by Friedlander
and Silver (1967) showed the same pattern,
but only for the developed nations. A study
by Russett (1964) on 38 nations showed a
slight negative partial association between
per-capita gross national product and the
birth rate. However, this negative correlation can be substantially discounted because
a high income per capita can be automatically associated with low fertility by virtue of
the fact that a high-fertility population
will have a high ratio of dependents to earners. Of the studies showing a positive regression between national income and fertility
level after control for other variables, those
by Heer and by Friedlander and Silver
appropriately defined income as income
per adult rather than per capita.

The study by Hathaway, Beegle, and
Bryant (1969) of components by residence

and color of the population of United States
counties by region provides 18 different
tests of the association between family income and fertility, holding constant other
variables including female income and the
proportion of females 14 and over who are
employed. Family income was positively
associated with fertility in 7 cases and negatively associated in 11 cases. In all three
comparisons for the United States as a
whole, the multivariate relation between
family income and fertility was positive;
on the other hand, the within-region associations were mainly negative.

Educational level, literacy, and similar
variables have consistently been found to
correlate negatively with fertility in most
but not all previous studies. With respect
to fertility differences between nations,
Adelman (1963), Heer (1966), and Friedlander and Silver (1967) found measures relating to educational attainment to be inversely related to fertility after statistical control
for other factors. In studies with subnational
units as the unit of analysis, similar negative
correlations between educational attainment and fertility were found for Taiwan
(Collver, Speare and Liu, 1967) and Puerto
Rico (Schultz, 1967). In their study of components of the population of United States
counties, Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant
(1969) found education to be negatively
associated with fertility in 16 of 18 possible
cases. For ethnic groups within the Soviet
Union, Mazur (1967) also showed a negative
partial association between a measure of
educational attainment and fertility.

On the other hand, in their study of subnational fertility differences in Latin American nations, Heer and Turner found a somewhat confusing situation. Holding constant
the local proportion literate and other variables, they found the national proportion
literate to be positively correlated with fertility. Other inconsistent results were obtained by Leasure (1963) in his study of
Spanish provinces. He found a slight nega

tive partial association between education
and marital fertility for 1950, but substantial
positive partial correlations for 1900 and
1910. Mazur (1968) found a substantial
negative association between female educational attainment and fertility in urban and
rural parts of non-Moslem areas of the
U.S.S.R., but slight positive associations for
urban and rural parts of predominantly
Moslem areas (also including the Armenian
Republic).

The association between female laborforce participation and fertility was examined by Heer and Turner (1965) for local
areas in each Latin American nation. They
showed the proportion of females 15 years
old and over in the labor force to be negatively associated with fertility after statistical control for seven other variables. Mazur
(1968) in his study of urban and rural parts
of oblasts in Moslem and non-Moslem portions of the Soviet Union consistently
found the proportion of women in the labor
force to be inversely related to fertility after
control for other variables although a strong
relation was observed only for the rural
parts of non-Moslem areas. Collver (1968),
in a study of fertility differences among 65
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas of
the United States in 1960, showed various
measures of fertility all to be negatively
correlated with the percentage of women in
the labor force. Moreover, he demonstrated
that this correlation did not occur because
of an association between female labor-force
participation rates and female educational
attainment. In a previous study, Collver
and Langlois (1962) had demonstrated
inverse correlations between measures of
fertility and female labor-force participation for the metropolitan areas of eight
different nations. Hathaway, Beegle, and
Bryant (1969) showed the proportion of
females employed in components of United
States county populations to be negatively
associated with fertility in 12 of 18 possible
cases,

Social Biology

The concept of population potential has
not been used in previous studies of areal
differences in fertility, at least to the writer’s
knowledge. However, concepts related to it,
such as population density, proportion
urban, and distance from the nearest city,
have been used in many previous works,
The study of Taiwanese fertility differences
(Collver, Speare, and Liu, 1967) made use
of two concepts, logarithm of population
per square mile and distance from nearest
city of 50,000 persons or more, which in
combination are very similar to the concept
of population potential. For the Taiwanese
data, both variables correlated inversely with
fertility, with population density showing
the larger standardized multiple regression
coefficient. With respect to national fertility differences, the studies by Adelman
(1963), Heer (1966), and Friedlander and
Silver (1967) all showed population density
to be inversely related to fertility. The excellent studies by Keyfitz (1952, 1953) showed
a direct relation between fertility and distance from city, holding constant other
variables. Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant
(1969) made use of a scale measuring the
influence upon a county of the nearest
metropolitan area dependent on the size of
that metropolitan area and its distance
from the county. In their multivariate
analysis they found this scale to be negatively associated with fertility in 17 of 18 cases.

With respect to the influence of the sex
ratio on fertility, Heer and Turner (1965)
showed that for all local areas in Latin
America the sex ratio had only a slight
positive association with fertility after control for other variables. However, within
certain of the Latin American nations the
sex ratio had a very large positive association with fertility while within others the
association was slight, and in a few cases
the relation was actually negative.

Concerning the association between proportion Roman Catholic and fertility, Russett (1964) has shown a slight positive corDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

relation for a sample of 38 nations after a
control for several variables indicating the
level of socioeconomic development. No
previous study of areal variations in United
States fertility has included proportion
Roman Catholic as a variable.

SELECTION OF SAMPLE

The universe for the present study consisted of 3,134 counties (or county equivalents) in the United States. From these, a
one-in-five sample was selected by combining two one-in-ten systematic samples
each having a different random starting
point. From this sample of counties further
exclusions were made for two reasons.
First, counties were excluded if according
to the 1960 census 10% or more of their
total population was living in group quarters. Such counties were excluded because
there was a high probability that the characteristics for the population of the county
as a whole would be unduly influenced by
the characteristics of its population in group
quarters. Secondly, counties were excluded
if all of the pertinent data were not available. In the original sample of counties, six
in Alaska and one in Hawaii were dropped
because information on population potential was not available, and one small independent city in Virginia, newly created in
1960, because insufficient information was
available to compute reliable measures of
fertility and infant mortality. The final
sample contained 591 counties,

RESULTS

The mean and standard deviation of each
variable together with the matrix of zeroorder correlations are shown in Table 1.
Logio of population potential can be seen to
have the highest correlation (—0.39) with
the standardized fertility ratio. The second
most important correlate of fertility 1s the
proportion Roman Catholic in the archdiocese or diocese in which the county is
located. (0.30). Only two correlations be

187

tween independent variables are substantial:
that between median male income and median years of school completed (0.78) and
that between proportion nonwhite and
infant mortality (0.57). The surprising lack
of positive correlation between the Catholic
variable and logi9 of population potential
is due in part to the coincidence of very
high proportion Catholic and low population potential in southwestern Louisiana,
south Texas, and New Mexico.

Table 2 presents the results of the multiple-regression analysis. The two variables
of proportion Roman Catholic and logo of
population potential are seen to be of much
greater importance than the other variables.
The contribution to R? of the first of these
two variables is 0.13 and that of the second
is 0.11. In other words, the addition of proportion Catholic adds 0.13 to the proportion
of variance explained by the seven variables
excluding proportion Catholic, while the
addition of logio of population potential
adds 0,11 to the proportion of variance explained by the seven variables excluding population potential. It should also be mentioned that the combined contribution to R?
of these two variables is 0.27, so that the
other six variables in combination explain
only 0.08 of the variance.

Other items of information presented in
Table 2 are the partial correlation coefficients and the Beta coefficients (standardized regression coefficients). The square of
the partial correlation coefficient shows the
additional variance explained separately by
each variable as a proportion of the variance
left unexplained by the remaining variables.
The sign of the partial correlation coefficient
indicates the direction of association holding
constant the other independent variables.
The Beta or standardized regression coefficient shows, when all variables are expressed
in terms of standard scores, the slope of
each independent variable with respect to
fertility after control for other variables.

Speare, and Liu (1967) on townships and
cities in Taiwan, were conducted with units
more or less comparable in population to
United States counties. Schultz, with seven
independent variables, was able to explain
47% of the variance in the crude birth rate
among the Puerto Rican municzpios in the
mid-1950’s. Collver, Speare, and Liu were
able to account for 70% of the variance in’
the total fertility rate of the townships and
cities in Taiwan. (However, the Taiwan

The rank order of importance of variables
(judged by the magnitude of their Beta

the county is located, (2) logio of population

DISCUSSION

One of the more striking results of the
present study when compared to many other
studies of areal differences in fertility is the
relatively small proportion (35%) of the
total variance explainable by the combined
total of the eight independent variables.

Multiple Coefficient of Determination
(R?) = 0.352; F(8,582) = 39.59,

results are not directly comparable with the
present results or those of Schultz because
each township or city was weighted by its
population prior to computation of the regression equation.)

In the study by Heer and Turner (1965)
of Latin America, for which the units were
directly below the national level and hence
substantially larger in population than
United States counties, 44% of the variance
in the child-woman ratio was explained by
eight independent variables. In Mazur’s
study of ethnic groups in the Soviet Union,
where the units also had on the average
substantially higher population than United
States counties, 83% of the variance in
fertility was explainable by only four variables. Furthermore, all of the studies of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

190 Heer and Boynton

national fertility differences have explained
a relatively high proportion of the variance
ranging upward from the figure of 63%
reported by Heer (1966). Only the studies
by Leasure (1963), concerned with variations in marital fertility among Spanish
provinces, report a relatively low proportion
of explained variance. For data pertaining
to 1900, 15% of the variance was explainable; for 1900, 37%, and for 1950, 17%.
However, since there were only three independent variables in these Spanish regression analyses compared to seven in the present study of United States counties, one
would expect, other things being equal, a
higher proportion of the variance to be explainable for the United States counties
than for the Spanish provinces. It might
also be noted that the amount of variance
explained in the current study cannot be
compared with the amount of variance explained in the regression analysis of Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant (1969) for the
urban rural-nonfarm, and rural-farm components of the white population of United
States counties. In two of these three analyses almost as much of the variance in fertility was explained as in the present study,
despite the fact that the proportion Roman
Catholic was not included as a variable. The
surprising results can be explained by the
fact that their fertility variable was not age
adjusted and that two of their nine independent variables were ones included merely
to adjust for differences in age composition
among females of reproductive age. In each
case these two age-composition variables
were together responsible for explaining a
substantial proportion of the variance in
Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant’s fertility
variable.

The relatively small proportion of variance explainable in the present study provokes speculation concerning additional
variables, for which data were not readily
available, which, had they been utilized,
might account for more of the variance.

Social Biology

First of all, although we cannot be sure
how much inaccuracy is contained in our
approximation to the proportion Roman
Catholic in each county, there was obviously some inaccuracy, and it is likely that this
error causes us to lose some ability to explain
variance in fertility.

The present study also takes no account
of the existence or quality of family-planning clinics. Very fragmentary data suggest
that organized family-planning programs
may have been a relatively minor factor in
explaining the variations in fertility among
United States counties in and around 1960.
In 1960, the seven southern states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia
were the only ones to have family-planning
services incorporated into their publichealth programs. The proportion of counties
in these seven states whose actual fertility
was below that predicted by the regression
equation was approximately the same as in
the other states. Specifically, in the 120
sample counties in the seven states with
officially sponsored family-planning programs, 53% of the counties had lower fertility than that predicted by the regression
equation; in the remaining 471 sample
counties outside of these seven states with
family-planning programs, the proportion
of counties with fertility less than that
predicted by the regresion equation was
51%. At least in North Carolina, a state
whose family-planning program began in
1937 and is the oldest in the nation (Eliot,
1966), family-planning activities were not
of major magnitude in the years immediately prior to 1960, For example, in 1957 the
total number of women referred for contraceptive services was less than 3% of the
number of live births in that state (Norton
and Donnelly, 1964). Family-planning clinics in the United States sponsored by approximately a hundred Planned Parenthood
affiliates were operating in 1960 almost
entirely in large metropolitan counties. The

Vol. 17, No. 3

number of patients served by Planned Parenthood clinics in 1960 in the United States
was 282,000 (Corsa, 1966) which was less
than 3% of all live births in the nation
during that year and perhaps around 6% of
all live births in the areas served.

Another unmeasured variable which is
probably of some importance is the proportion of the total population of Spanish surname. An analysis of the counties which
showed extremely large positive differences
between their actual fertility and that predicted by the regression equation revealed
several of these to be in Texas, New Mexico,
and Colorado bordering on or adjacent to
the Rio Grande River, where presumably a
high proportion of the population is of
Spanish surname.

A third topic which needs further research is the extent to which the obtained
Beta coefficients differ from what they
would have been if all relevant variables
had been accurately included. For example,
does the fact that we cannot measure the
proportion Roman Catholic in each county
bias the measures we obtain for the other
independent variables?

Finally, even if we could assume that the
obtained Beta coefficients are accurate, we
must consider whether they represent the
effect of the presumed independent variables
upon fertility, whether they may at least
in part reflect the effect of the supposed
dependent variable upon the independent
variables, or whether they result because
the presumed independent and the presumed dependent variable are produced by a
common cause. Two of the independent
variables have observed Beta coefficients
which, if accurate, probably overestimate
the impact of that variable upon fertility.
These are infant mortality and female
labor-force participation. In these cases
fertility no doubt exerts an influence upon
the independent variable in the same direction as the impact of the independent variable upon fertility. There is good evidence

Fertility by Counties 191

that the level of fertility to some degree
directly affects the level of infant mortality
since infant mortality varies directly with
the mother’s parity even after statistical
control for other variables (Heady and
Morris, 1959). It can also be argued that
the achievement of low fertility, however
motivated, induces women to enter the labor force.

On the other hand, the observed Beta
coefficient for logi9 of population potential
may underestimate the impact of that
variable upon fertility since the effect of
fertility upon logio of population potential
probably is direct, whereas we assume the
effect of logio of population potential upon
fertility to be inverse.

An accurate Beta coefficient for the association of median male income and fertility
also may not correctly reflect the impact of
income upon fertility. It is possible, for instance, that a continued level of high fertility in the past would produce not only high
fertility in the present but also, by creating
pressure of population upon resources, a
reduction in level of income. Thus, it may be
that the effect of median male income upon
fertility is direct even though an accurate
Beta coefficient might be slightly negative.

CONCLUSIONS

Two variables, (@) the proportion of
Roman Catholics in the archdiocese or diocese to which the county belongs and (8)
the logiy of the population potential in the
county, are found to be the most important
in accounting for variation in the age-standardized fertility of United States county
populations. There is little reason to doubt
that these two variables are causally influential. Previous studies indicate the higher fertility ideals and greater reluctance to practice contraception among Catholics than
members of other religious groups (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1958; Westoff, Potter, Sagi, Mishler, 1961; Whelpton,
Campbell, and Patterson, 1966; Blake,

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

192 Heer and Boynton

1966). Moreover, several experts have suggested that a high density of population
reduces biological fecundity (Christian,
1950; Calhoun, 1962; Olin, 1966); alternatively, high population potential may facilitate acquisition of birth control knowledge
(Collver, Speare, and Liu, 1967) or increase
the costs of child rearing. The proportion
nonwhite and the infant mortality rate were
also found to be positively and statistically
significantly associated with fertility. In
the case of proportion nonwhite there is
ample reason to believe that it exerts a
causal influence upon fertility because of the
relatively little knowledge or use of contraception among blacks (Whelpton, Campbell and Patterson, 1966). With respect to
infant mortality, there is good reason to
believe that high infant mortality may induce high fertility (Heer and Smith, 1968
and 1969), but there is also the rationale
that elevated fertility results in high infant
mortality so that the causal influence of
infant mortality upon fertility may be overstated by the Beta coefficient relating these
two variables. The remaining variables
included in the study—median male income,
median school years completed by persons
25 years old and over, the proportion of
women 14 years old and older in the labor
force, and the ratio of men to women of
reproductive age—did not show a statistically significant association with fertility with
other variables controlled.

The importance of our crude measure of
proportion Roman Catholic suggests the
desirability of small-area data on religious
preference from the decennial census.
Unfortunately, such data cannot now be
obtained prior to the 1980 census. In default of such data from the census it would
appear very much worthwhile for some
organization to gather together on a regular
basis the official data on Roman Catholic
affiliation to produce statistics on the number of Roman Catholics in each county of
the United States.

 

Social Biology

Population potential has been shown here
to be a very important variable in determining variation in fertility among United
States counties. This is not surprising in
view of the fact that for individuals in the
United States fertility varies considerably,
from a peak among residents of rural farms
to a trough among residents of large urbanized areas, and that within rural areas fertility varies directly with distance from the
city (Kiser, Grabill, Campbell, 1968). What
is surprising is that population potential has
not been employed more widely in previous
studies of fertility. The usual practice in
national fertility surveys is to cross-classify
respondents into several discrete residence
groups ranging from rural-farm to resident
of one of the largest cities. This practice
has two disadvantages. First it does not
allow one to construct a continuous variable
on a ratio or interval scale. Secondly, it
ignores the variable of contiguity to other
populated areas already demonstrated as
important by the studies relating rural fertility to distance from the city. Since every
respondent in national fertility surveys can
very easily be classified according to the
population potential of the county in which
he lives, there seems to be no reason why
such surveys should not routinely make
use of this variable.

Results from national fertility surveys
which do provide a value of population
potential for each respondent should help
us gain a firmer grasp on why this variable
affects fertility. Olin’s hypothesis that
crowding reduces biological fecundity could
be examined by such means as studying
how an individual’s status with respect to
population potential affects the frequency of
sexual intercourse or the proportion of all
pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion. The hypothesis of Collver, Speare, and
Liu that high population potential facilitates
acquisition of birth-control knowledge could
also easily be investigated. Finally, there
would be great value in studies designed to

ascertain the average costs of child-rearing
among individuals differing with respect to
the population potential of their county of
residence.
