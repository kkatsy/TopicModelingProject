ABSTRACT: Desired family size and contraceptive behavior of 986 ever-married women aged
15—54 from Northern Mindanao, the Philippines, are described. Using the Dow and Wemer
typology of demographic and contraceptive patterns, it was found that a majority of the women
were traditional in their demographic attitude and contraceptive behavior. A substantial proportion of the women desired medium to large families. Inconsistency in attitude and behavior
was also manifested by women who desired small families but have never used efficient family
planning methods. Sociodemographic characteristics of these women are described. A majority
of the women who have never used efficient contraception also never practiced family planning.
Rhythm was the primary method of birth control among demographic innovators and traditionals who have ever used inefficient methods; the pill was popular among contraceptive innovators and the moderns. A considerable proportion of the demographic innovators and the traditionals were not currently using any family planning method; a lesser proportion of
contraceptive innovators and moderns were also not using birth control methods. Relevance of

 

the findings to family planning programs is pointed out. Recommendations are given.

The inconsistency between attitude
and behavior has been well documented
(Liska, 1975). Various studies in fertility
and family planning have shown how inconsistency is manifested in the incongruency between expressed desired
family size and contraceptive use
(Freedman and Coombs, 1974; Poffenberger, 1968; Stycos and Back, 1964;
Hill et al., 1959; Figa-Talamanca, 1972).
Consistent with the findings of studies
on desired family size and contraceptive
use, the 1977 Republic of the Philippines Fertility Survey reported that not
only do Filipino women show a distinct
preference for small families, they also
exhibit an extensive knowledge about
contraception. However, the same survey reported only modest use of efficient
contraception among Filipino women.
Only a quarter of the women had ever

Z2

tried the pill and one in fourteen had
used an IUD (Concepcion, 1980). The
1976 National Acceptor Survey (NAS)
revealed that of the acceptors who had
terminated contraceptive uSe within one
year after acceptance of any method,
only 8.0 per cent discontinued use in order to have another child. About 4.0 per
cent said they had discontinued use because they no longer needed contraception (e.g., menopause) and 11.0 per cent
ceased contraceptive use because they
became pregnant (Laing, 1977). Thus,
while a considerable proportion of Filipino women reported that they did not
want additional children, this desire was
not implemented in terms of family
planning practice, particularly the use of
efficient contraception (Palmore and
Concepcion, 1981; Concepcion, 1980).
In order to assess the demographic

and contraceptive patterns of a sample
of Filipino women from Northern Mindanao, the Dow and Werner (1982) typology of contraceptive and fertility behavior was utilized. Efficient
contraceptive use and desired family
size were cross-classified along these dimensions, resulting in the following categories: (1) moderns or the demographic and contraceptive innovators,
(2) transitionals composed of the demographic but not contraceptive innovators,! and (3) transitionals who were
contraceptive but not demographic innovators,” and (4) traditionals or the
noninnovators.

The measures of efficient use of contraception were similar to those of Dow
and Werner.? However, desired family
size was measured using the Coombs
Number Preference Scale (Coombs,

‘Demographic but not contraceptive innovators are referred to as demographic innovators

throughout the article,

1974, 1976; Coombs et al., 1975). This
scale was considered to be an improvement over the usual measure of desired
family size in that the number scale measured the respondent’s priorities or bias
toward a larger or smaller family size.
The respondent was given second, third,
or fourth choices beyond the first preference. Whether a respondent chose a
number that was greater or smaller than
her first choice would indicate how her
priorities regarding family size were ordered and which way she would tend to
“lean” if she did not get her first choice.
Thus, an individual’s response to questions about family size might be a point
on a continuum of acceptable number of
children, as opposed to the discrete and
fixed measure of desired family size often used in surveys. Location at the
lower end of the scale ({N—1-3) indicated an underlying preference for small
families, while an IN—4 meant a bias toward medium-sized families, and an IN—
5-7 indicated a preference for larger
families (Coombs, 1979). For typological purposes, underlying number preferences was categorized into preference
for small families and preference for medium to large families.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

During the months of May, June, and
July, 1980, a randomly selected sample
of 986 women was intervewed. Included
were ever-married women aged 15-54
who had at least one pregnancy. Table 1
shows selected socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the sample
as a whole. A majority of the women
(94.5 per cent) were married at the time
of the interview; 3.8 per cent were widowed, and 1.7 per cent were separated.

The median age was 34.96 years. On the
average, the women had been married
for twelve years. As an indication of the
stability of marriage, 95.5 per cent of the
women had been married only once.

About half of the women (49.9 per
cent) had one to four pregnancies; 32.5
per cent reported five to eight pregnancies; 13.3 per cent had nine to twelve;
and 4.3 per cent had been pregnant 13 to
18 times.

Less than half (47.7 per cent) resided
in households where the average
monthly income was under 500 pesos
(one dollar = 7.5 pesos). About 35 per
cent lived in households where income
was from 500 pesos to 999 pesos, and
17.5 per cent in households where income was 1,000 pesos or over.

RESULTS

DEMOGRAPHIC AND CONTRACEPTIVE
PATTERNS

Figure 2 shows the distribution of
women by underlying desired family
size and efficient contraceptive use.
About 3.0 per cent of the women in the
sample were both contraceptive and demographic innovators or moderns (Box
A); 8.4 per cent were demographic innovators or transitionals (Box B); 26.4
per cent were contraceptive innovators
or transitionals (Box C) and 62.1 per
cent were noninnovators or transitionals
(Box D).

Northern Mindanao findings regarding traditional and modern women were
consistent with Dow and Werner’s
(1982) findings among Kenyan women.
However, an opposite pattern appears
to emerge regarding transitional
women. While Dow and Werner (1982)
found more demographic innovators
than contraceptive innovators (20 per

cent vs. 8 per cent), the present study
shows more contraceptive innovators
(26.5 per cent) than demographic innovators (8.3 per cent) among women in
the Northern Mindanao region of the
Philippines. This finding seems to indicate that a substantial percentage of
women in Northern Mindanao use efficient contraception at some point in
their lives while still desiring larger families.

Although it was expected that a
larger proportion of women would be
categorized under Box B, the finding in
this study shows women in Northern
Mindanao to be more traditional than
women in other parts of Asia. Efficient
contraception may have been used for
spacing purposes rather than to stop reproduction altogether. This finding is
consistent with the demographic behav
ior of Cebuano women (Yu and Liu,
1980). The proportion of women (8.3
per cent) in the present study who
wanted small families but had never
used efficient contraception suggest a
need for family planning programs that
promote effective methods of birth
planning.

CHARACTERISTICS OF INNOVATORS AND
NONINNOVATORS

Age.—As might be expected, more
women over 35 years of age (70.3 per
cent) were traditional in their demographic attitude and contraceptive behavior. However, 66.9 per cent of those
less than 25 years of age were also noninnovators, while about 48.9 per cent of
women 25 to 34 years of age were in this
category. The greatest percentage (14.9
per cent) of demographic innovators

were under 25 years of age, while
women 25-35 years of age formed the
greatest percentage (37.4 per cent) of
contraceptive innovators. More women
under 25 years of age, compared to the
other age groups, were modern in their
contraceptive and demographic behavior.

Education.—As expected, women
who had attended college were more
likely to be modern in their demographic attitude and contraceptive behavior, compared to those who attended only high school or elementary
school, or who received no formal education. Also, more contraceptive innovators were found among collegeeducated women (31.3 per cent). As
expected, the greatest percentage of
women who desired medium to large
families and never used contraception
were found among women who had no
formal education or had only elementary education.

Residence and Socioeconomic
Status.—The Northern Mindanao region was divided into three types of
area: urban, semi-urban, and rural.‘ Socloeconomic status (Madigan, n.d.) indicates whether a woman lived in a
lower-class household, or a middle- or
upper-class household. Table 2 shows
the distribution of women by residence
and socioeconomic status. Because of
the few cases found among the moderns
and demographic innovators, comparison will be made among contraceptive
innovators and traditionals according to
SES and residence.

When SES was held constant, poor
women in semi-urban areas were found
to be more likely to become innovators
than were poor rural women with 28.7

4Residence was designated by the type of sample area the respondent resided in. An area was
considered urban if it was part of a chartered city;
semi-urban areas consisted of municipal poblaciones (town proper); and the rest of the sample area was considered rural.

per cent and 19.0 per cent, respectively,
falling in this category.° Middle- and
upper-class women in semi-urban areas
were more likely to become contraceptive innovators than middle- and upperclass women in urban and rural areas.
More traditional women were found
among middle- and upper-class women
in urban areas than in semi-urban or rural areas. No significant difference in the
proportion traditional was found among
lower SES urban and rural women.
When residence was controlled for,
middle- and upper-class women in urban areas were more likely to become
demographic innovators than the poor
women in the same areas. However,
middle- and upper-class women from

- the rural area are more likely to become

contraceptive innovators than are poor
women in the rural area. The same pattern was observed between lower- and
middie-upper class in the semi-urban
area.

As expected, traditionals were more
likely to be found among the lower-class
women than the middle- and upperclass women in the rural areas. The
same pattern was observed in the urban
and semi-urban areas.

FAMILY PLANNING PRACTICE

Ever-Use of Contraception.—Table 3
depicts the contraceptive pattern of
women in the sample. Among women
who never used efficient methods, 1.e.,
the demographic innovators and the
noninnovators, a large proportion (84.5
per cent of the the demographic innovators and 84.2 per cent of the noninnovators) never used any family planning
method. About 15.4 per cent of the de

of the noninnovators only used inefficient methods. A large proportion of
those who ever used efficient
contraception—86.0 per cent of the
moderns and 91.0 per cent of the contraceptive innovators—had never used any
inefficient method.

The figures in Table 3 seem to indicate noncontraceptive innovation as the
nonuse of any family planning
method—efficient or inefficient—since
a large proportion of those who prefer

contraception and noninnovators were

found. On the other hand, of those who
ever used efficient contraception, only a
small proportion ever used inefficient
methods. This finding points out the
needed effort by family planning programs to encourage demographic innovators to use more efficient methods in
order to limit reproduction to desired
family size. In addition, traditionals
should be motivated to prefer small family size and encouraged to use contraception.

Methods Ever Used.—Table 4 shows
that about the same percentages of
modern and contraceptive innovators
were pill users. On the other hand,
among women who used only inefficient
methods, 91.7 per cent of the demographic innovators and 74.7 per cent of
the traditionals used rhythm as a family
planning method. Moreover, about 15.8
per cent of the traditionals used withdrawal as a family planning method.

ning method used by nonpregnant, currently married women in the sample
shows that a substantial percentage
(82.7 per cent for demographic innovators and 85.4 per cent of noninnovators)
of those who never used efficient contraception were not using any contraceptive method at the time of the study.
These data are shown in Table. 5. Of
those who used efficient contraception
at some time in their lives, about 13.8
per cent of the moderns and 29.9 per
cent of the contraceptive innovators
were not practicing family planning at
the time of interview.

Table 5 also indicates that the pill was
the most common contraceptive
method currently used by those who
used efficient contraception, with 31.1
per cent of the moderns using the
method, compared to 23.1 per cent of
the contraceptive innovators. Next to
the pill, sterilization was reported to be
the next widely used method by the
moderns and contraceptive innovators.
About the same percentage of current
users of rhythm was found among modern and demographic innovators (10.3

cent of the traditionals resort to rhythm
as a family planning method, while the
corresponding percentage for contraceptive innovators was 6.3 per cent.

Possible explanations for the shift
from efficient methods to rhythm
among modern and contraceptive innovators were the fear of possible sideeffects of the more efficient methods
, and expenditures related to the pill and

innovators reported two live births or
less. A greater proportion of contraceptive innovators had more than two live
births, compared to the three other
types of respondents in the sample.

The findings depicted in Table 6 indicate the importance of the underlying
preference for small families. Women
who prefer small families—modern and
demographic innovators—were more
likely to have low fertility than women
who prefer medium to large families.
While it was expected that traditional
women were more likely to have higher
fertility than others, the finding regarding contraceptive innovators was unexpected. Efficient use of contraception
without the desire for small families will
not be enough to bring down fertility
levels. This underscores the importance
of motivation to have small families in
order to have a successful family planning program. Innundation of efficient
methods (Ravenholt and Chao, 1974)
may not be sufficient since a shift to inefficient methods of or nonpractice of
family planning may take place which
could result in unwanted or unplanned
births. However, the possibility of efficient contraception use for spacing
purposes in order to achieve traditional
family size can not be discounted.

GENDER PREFERENCE

It has been reported that demographic and contraceptive behavior was
highly affected by the desired family sex
composition (Williamson, 1976;
Coombs, 1977). Until the desired number of boys and girls has been achieved,
a couple may postpone the use of an efficient contraceptive method.

Underlying sex preference for offspring was measured using the Coombs
Sex Preference Scale (Coombs et al.,

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

240

1975). Again the respondent was given
choices beyond the first preference.
These choices indicated the ordering of
her priorities in terms of gender preferences for offspring. Location at the
lower end of the scale (IS—1—3) showed a
strong preference for girls while a strong
preference for male offspring was indicated by location at the upper end of the
sex preference scale (IS—6-7). A preference for equal number of boys and girls
was shown by IS—-4—5 (Coombs, 1977).
Data presented in Table 7 suggest an
overall underlying preference for female offspring among women in Northern Mindanao. Women in all four categories showed a strong underlying
preference for girls: 58.8 per cent of the
moderns, 41.7 per cent of the contraceptive innovators, 47.9 per cent of the demographic innovators, and 44.9 per cent
of the noninnovators. A balanced number of male and female children found
least acceptance among moderns (13.3

per cent) and the most favor among
noninnovators (25.5 per cent). About
one-third of the demographic innovators and contraceptive innovators were
found to prefer male offspring (34.1 per
cent and 33.0 per cent), while 27.9 per
cent of the moderns and 29.6 per cent of
the noninnovators showed an underlying male preference.

UNWANTED BIRTHS

Because a desire for small families,
coupled with the use of inefficient contraception, will ultimately lead to unwanted births, it was deemed worthwhile to investigate demographic and
contraceptive behavior and its relationship with unwanted births.

Unwanted birth was measured by
asking the mother to indicate which of
her pregnancies she had not wanted at
all or would have preferred later. The
former is referred to as “number failures” and the latter as “timing failures”
(Jaffe, 1971). Both types of failures are
considered unwanted births in the
present study.

used efficient contraception tended to
admit having unwanted birth. About
41.7 per cent of the contraceptive innovators and 39.3 per cent of the moderns
had unwanted births, compared to 20.9
per cent among demographic innovators and 24.0 per cent among traditionals. Thus, while demographic innovators wanted small families, only about
21.0 per cent admitted having an un_wanted birth. Less than a quarter of the
otraditionals were in this category.

DISCUSSION

Analysis of the desired family size
sand contraceptive behavior of a sample
Sof women in Northern Mindanao shows
cothat contraceptive innovators had more
slive births than demographic innova‘ators, the moderns, and the traditionals.
While it seems possible that contracep‘Otive innovators use efficient contracepAtion as a spacing tool until the desired
Ofamily size was obtained, the possibility
that women use efficient contraception
Oafter they have more children than they
‘<want should also be taken into account
—(Kiesler, 1977). However, it should be
emphasized that a majority of the
women were noninnovators (62.1 per
Scent), and this indicates a lack of motiEvation for small family size. As pointed
Aout by Potts and Selman (1979), motiva
tion for small family is a prerequisite for
a successful family planning program.
Without motivation, what family planning programs do is reduce the number

of unwanted births. While this is a
worthwhile cause in itself, fertility will
continue to be high in the absence of this
motivation for a smaller family size.

Lest it be forgotten, family planning
programs should also reach out to those
who are sufficiently motivated to have
small families but have not ever used efficient contraception. Equally important is the task of motivating and introducing the traditional women to the
idea of the feasibility of family limitation.

One of the findings of this research is
that a majority of the women who never
used efficient contraception also never
used inefficient or traditional methods.
Efforts should be made to change this.
In addition, more efforts should be
made to bring those modern and contraceptive innovators who had stopped using any family planning method to practice contraception again. Explanation as
to the possible side-effects of the more
efficient methods should be given to
fearful acceptors and terminators.. If
rhythm was preferred, more efficient
ways of practicing rhythm should be discussed with both husband and wife.
