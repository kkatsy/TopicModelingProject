Ideal Family Size and Family Background: An
Examination of Mothers’ Employment and

Daughters’ Family Size Preferences

For the past two decades, demographers have been investigating the notion
of how many children the adult population
thinks is ideal for the average family to
have (Wheipton et al., 1966; Westoff et
al., 1963; Yeracaris, 1959). When information on ideal family size is related to
characteristics of respondents, factors that
influence family size can be determined.

In the Western nations of the world
where technology is highly advanced and
rational decision making is fairly ubiquitous, contraceptive techniques make
family size ideals a reality for most
couples. Research on ideal family size
among adults clearly reflects an overwhelming majority favoring a two-to-four
child range with four children being the
modal category and fewer than 0.4 per cent
stating an ideal of less than two children
according to Whelpton et al. (1966, p. 33).
The two-to-four child range appears at the
very least to be the normative range of
ideal family size in American society.

There have been many studies on family
size and characteristics of respondents.
Fewer studies have dealt with background
factors. For example, Hendershot (1967)
has stated that children form family size
preferences from communications with
their mothers or from patterns of family
communication and roles. Bumpass (1967)
reports that idea] family size preferences

are formed early in life, remain fairly
stable, and affect later fertility. He also
concluded that childless women are as
stable in fertility expectations as are
women with children. Gustavus and Nam
(1970, p. 50) concluded that “ideas about
family size are formed very early in the life
cycle.”

Since there is some degree of consensus
that family size ideals are formed early in
life, it appears that background factors of
respondents should be associated with
these ideals. Since the socialization process
forms patterns of attitudes and behavior
for later life, and since the family is the
prime agent of this process, it would appear then that characteristics of the family
would influence family size preferences for
persons in their formative years.

The present study attempts to analyze
respondents’ mothers’ employment in
relation to ideal family size preferences
of respondents. It would appear that
daughters whose mothers were employed
in their formative years would report a
lower ideal family size preference than
daughters whose mothers did not work.
Similarly, in studies of female employment
and fertility it is believed that “an increase
of women’s work participation would tend
to depress fertility” (Collver, 1968, p. 60).
This may be the case when investigating a
particular generation, but the relationship

may differ when examining female employment and fertility across generations,
as that of mother and daughter.

The specific purpose of this paper is to
examine the relationship between mothers’
employment and daughters’ ideal family
size preferences in order to ascertain the
usefulness of family background factors
and to determine whether family size
ideals are formed early in life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample was drawn from a sample
of the adult American population conducted in 1975 by the National Opinion
Research Center. In the present study, the
sample was narrowed to married women
in the childbearing years aged 18 to 49
resulting in 434 cases.

The employment-of-mother item was
dichotomized into a yes-no response. The
question read “Did your mother work for
as long as a year around the time you were
16?”

RESULTS

Employment of respondents’ mothers
showed a very interesting finding. Those
respondents whose mothers worked for a
year or more reported a mean ideal family
size of 2.54 children. Those who reported
their mothers not working had a mean ideal
family size of 2.25 children. The modal
categories were 4 or more children for
daughters whose mothers worked, and 0-1

children for daughters whose mothers did
not work.

Daughters of mothers who worked
could have perceived their mothers as
either postponing or deciding not to have
additional children. It is likely that mothers favored employment over childbearing. This could have influenced respondents (daughters) to have higher ideals
than daughters whose mothers did not
work. It is difficult to determine exactly
what factors are operating here, but respondents whose mothers worked could
have negatively viewed their mothers’
postponement or not having additional
children in their (the daughters’) formative
years.

This finding indicates that female employment across generations may not
depress fertility as the case may be when
viewing a single cohort. Since there is a
general concensus that family size ideals
are formed early in the life cycle, this data
at least minimally supports the notion that
mothers’ employment has a negative effect
on daughters’ fertility.

It appears that mother’s employment
and such family background variables as
father’s occupation, family income, residence, religion, and size of family of orientation could be useful in investigating family size preferences. It might be even more
useful to study relationships between ideal
family size, family background factors,
and current family factors in order to
strengthen the growing body of knowledge
in fertility research as well as to examine
fertility across generations.
