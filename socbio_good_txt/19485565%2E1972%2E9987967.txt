Socioeconomic and Seasonal Variations

in Births: A Replication

This paper examines the relationship
between seasonal variations in births and
socioeconomic status. The analysis presented here is a replication and extension
of earlier studies by Pasamanick, Dinitz,
and Knoblock (1960) and Zelnik (1969).
Pasamanick and his coauthors examined
the indicated relationship using births to
residents of Baltimore, Maryland, during
the five-year period 1952-56, whereas Zelnik’s analysis concerned births to Baltimore
residents during the period 1961-65. In
both studies, the socioeconomic status of
the mothers was determined by census
tract of residence, with median rental or
value of the dwelling property being the
determinant of the socioeconomic category
of a tract.

The Pasamanick study divided the white
population into five socioeconomic levels;
nonwhites were treated as a single group.
Their analysis indicated a rectilinear pattern of births for the highest socioeconomic
one-fifth of whites, but not for nonwhites
or the lowest three-fifths of the white socioeconomic continuum (Pasamanick et al.,
1960). (The authors are silent on the pattern of second highest fifth.)

* The author is a graduate student at The Johns
Hopkins University.

Zelnik’s study restricted itself to the
highest and lowest fifths, for whites and
nonwhites. His analysis indicated a nonrectilinear pattern for all four groups, and
further that the monthly patterns for the
whites (and possibly also for the nonwhites) in the highest and lowest fifths did
not differ from each other (Zelnik, 1969).

The discrepancy between the findings of
Pasamanick et al. and Zelnik regarding the
pattern of birth for the upper fifth led
Zelnik to reanalyze the pattern of births
for the period 1952-56, the data used by
Pasamanick et al. His reanalysis indicated
that contrary to the writings of Pasamanick
et al., the births of the upper fifth of
whites and nonwhites for the period 1952~
56 deviated significantly from a rectilinear
pattern (Zelnik, 1969).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The present study is also based on births
to Baltimore residents for a period of two
years, 1968-69. In this study the socioeconomic status of the mothers is measured
by two indices: (1) education of mother,
with college education four years and
above as the highest education category and
school education of six years and below as
the lowest education category; and (2) the

census tract of residence of mother, with
census tract allocated by median rental or
value of dwelling property, classified into
five socioeconomic levels.1 This study examines the seasonal patterns of births for
whites as well as blacks and in both instances for highest and lowest education
groups and socioeconomic fifths.? The socioeconomic measure by census tract is the
same as used in the earlier studies. Education, as a measure of socioeconomic status,
is new in this study and was possible because the data on educational achievement
of mothers has been available on birth
certificates since 1968.

The monthly distributions of births for
the highest and the lowest education groups

1The Baltimore Health Department has classified census tracts into five socioeconomic levels
and education into six categories with 1-6 years
of schooling as the lowest and college education 4 years and above as highest.

2 Births have been adjusted for differences in
the number of days in the months. There is an
anomaly for whites. The number of births in the
highest education group exceeds the number of
births in any other education group. This anomaly
is still noticed for the whites when the births are
classified by saciceconomic fifths.

 

and highest and lowest socioeconomic fifths
for whites and blacks will be examined to
see whether they differ from a rectilinear
pattern. According to Zelnik’s findings, a
test of this question would be expected to
show that the births of all socioeconomic
groups, both for whites and blacks, would
not be rectilinear. This question is examined through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov onesample test (of goodness of fit), a nonparametric test based on the maximum
absolute difference between the cumulative
per cent distribution of observed and expected (in this case of 8.3% of births per
month) events. The Kolmogorov-Simirnov
test of goodness of fit is more sensitive
than the chi-square test used for the same
purpose (see Guilford, 1965, p. 262).

FINDINGS

Table 1 provides the cumulative distributions of monthly births in the highest and
lowest socioeconomic fifths for whites and
blacks.

From Table 1 it appears that the births
of each group with the exception of the

 

 
Vol. 19, No. 1

highest one-fifth of whites differ significantly from rectilinearity, and the difference is found to be significant at the 0.05
level. The distribution of births in the
highest fifth of whites shows no significant
difference from rectilinearity. The finding
of an even distribution of births among the
highest socioeconomic fifth of whites is
contrary to the findings of Zelnik (1969).
We now move to examine the seasonal
variations in births by education groups.

‘Sfor the highest education groups, both
fAwhite and black, and for the lowest education group of blacks. The lowest education
group of whites showed significant varia‘stion in births.

Thus, in the case of births occurring
to Baltimore residents during the two-year

both white and black, is rectilinear, or the
difference from rectilinearity can be attributed to chance only. The above conclusion
also holds true, at least for the highest
white socioeconomic fifth, when census tract
was used as a measure of socioeconomic
status.

However, a word of caution should be
mentioned regarding the conclusion reached
here. The expected distribution of 8.3% of
the births implicitly assumes no secular
trend in births during the period 1968-69.
The presence of a secular trend would make
the expected distribution of births other
than the figure 8.3%, and in that case the
results and the conclusions stated above
could possibly be affected. However, it
should be noted that such trends could also
affect the results and conclusions of the previous studies by Pasamanick et al. (1960)
and Zelnik (1969), who also did not account for the effect of secularity in the expected distribution of births.

The present paper also examines whether
the monthly distribution of births for the
highest and lowest educational and socioeconomic levels differ from each other for

Sbirths for the highest socioeconomic groups, whites and blacks or whether they represent

two samples from the same universe. The
question was tested using the KolmogorovSmirnov two-sample test. This test is based
on the maximum absolute difference between the two cumulative per-cent distributions of the two samples. The null hypothesis of the test assumes that there is
no difference in the two distributions and
that they arise from the same sample. The
acceptance of the null hypothesis will arise
from the absolute difference in ogives that
is not statistically significant.

In the case of whites, for both educational and socioeconomic levels, this difference is found to be statistically significant
at the 0.05 level. In the case of blacks, this
difference is found to be significant for
socioeconomic levels at the 0.05 level, but
is not found to be significant for the educational groups.

SUMMARY

An examination of births occurring to
Baltimore residents during the period 1968—
69 reveals no signficant variability in the
distribution of births in the highest education groups, either for whites or for blacks.
The above conclusion also holds true for the
highest socioeconomic one-fifth for whites.
The present analysis also suggests that the
distribution of births for the highest and
the lowest socioeconomic groups in the case
of whites differs significantly, i.e., they belong to two different populations. This conclusion is true for the whites in both sets
of measurements, educational and socioeconomic. In the case of blacks, this difference
is found to be significant only for the
socioeconomic fifths, but not for the educational groups.

CONCLUSIONS

If we accept education as a better measurement of socioeconomic status than the
census tract, we find no significant variations in monthly distributions of births for
the highest socioeconomic group, whether
white or black. If we use census tract as a
measure of socioeconomic status, as used in
the earlier studies, we still find no significant variations in monthly distributions of
births, at least for whites. These findings
disagree with those of Zelnik who found
significant variations in births for the highest white socioeconomic fifth. The present
findings also show a significant difference in
the distribution of births for the lowest and
highest white socioeconomic groups under
both sets of measurement of socioeconomic
status. For blacks, this difference is significant only in the socioeconomic groups measured by census tract.

Thus, on the basis of the present findings,
we can say that at least for the period of
1968-69 the births of the highest socioeconomic fifth for whites, as measured by census tract, and highest education groups for
both blacks and whites do not differ significantly from rectilinearity. No seasonal variations in births occurred for those highest
socioeconomic groups and, therefore, they
do not conform to the pattern of seasonal
variability in births for highest socioeconomic groups as would be expected from the
findings of Zelnik (1969).
