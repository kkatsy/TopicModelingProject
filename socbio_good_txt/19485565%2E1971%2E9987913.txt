In a previous paper (King and Bailar,
1968), Lutheran ministers were noted to
have a very low overall mortality. The
findings are consistent with other data pertaining to health of clergymen, as shown in
various studies and statistics over the past
two centuries (King and Bailar, 1969).
However, more systematic investigations
are needed, particularly comparisons between nations, to ascertain mortality and
specific causes of death of the clerical profession. The present study examines mortality among ministers of another major
Protestant denomination, the Protestant
Episcopal Church in the United States of
America (hereafter referred to as Episcopal
clergymen), and compares the findings
whenever possible with those for Church of
England clergymen, England and Wales
(hereafter referred to in the text as Anglican
clergymen). Considering that the Episcopal
Church is an integrated part of the Anglican
Communion, this comparison between the
United States and Britain could have significant implications for health studies of
the clergy as a religious population, as well
as a profession (King and Bailar, 1969;
King 19705). For example, because of data
limitations, no international studies have

ever been made of clerical mortality by
denomination, Moreover, the results of
such investigations could provide useful
leads for further studies of occupationcentered health risk in the clerical profession at a cross-cultural level.

THE STUDY POPULATION

A defined population of 6,925 clergymen,
nearly all white, whose names appeared
in the Protestant Episcopal Church roster
of January 1, 1951, was used for the study.
The mortality experience of this population
was examined for a ten-year period ending
December 31, 1960. The group included, as
of the beginning of the study, 5,990 active
and 935 retired male clergymen (86.5%
vs. 13.5%); of the former, 77.9% were
parish ministers and 22.1% were, among
other things, administrators, missionaries,
teachers, military chaplains, and campus
ministers. Among the 6,035 clergymen whose
birthplaces were known, 87% were born in
the United States; of the foreign-born,
about 41% were from Canada, and 13%
each were from Great Britain and South
and Central America.

Ninety-five per cent of the study subjects
resided in the United States (mainly in the

northeastern and southern regions, being
40% and 27% respectively); of the remainder, the majority lived in the Caribbean
area. According to a recent survey of 15
white Protestant denominations, including
nearly all the major groups and several
small churches (Scherer, 1965, Tables 2,
3, 4, 5), about 30% of Episcopal parish
clergymen served in communities of 2,50024,999 and 25% in communities of half
a million and over. Slightly over one-sixth
of clergymen served in each of the two
intermediate population-size communities
(25,000-99,999; 100,000-499,999), but only
one-tenth served in communities with fewer
than 2,500 persons. More than half of
Episcopal clergymen came from upperclass families (as determined by father’s
occupation, i.e., professional, official, and
managerial), compared to one-third of their
contemporaries in the combined fifteen
denominations. Eighty-five per cent of
Episcopal ministers had at least a full
college education, and 40% had been previously affiliated with other (mainly Methodist and Presbyterian) denominations. The
corresponding figures for clergymen in the
fifteen denominations were 75% and 26%
respectively. Further data from the same
survey indicated that about 88% of Episcopal clergymen had ever been married,
in contrast to nearly 97% for ministers in
the combined fifteen denominations (Ministry Studies Board, unpublished).

DATA AND METHODS
EPISCOPAL CLERGYMEN

Personal data on the 6,925 ministers for
the ten-year study period were abstracted
from the files in the Church Pension Board,
supplemented by information contained in
the Stowe’s Clerical Directory, the Episcopal
Church Annual, and the diocesan journals
for the ten-year period, Death certificates
or certified letters were obtained from
various health offices in the United States
and abroad. On the basis of these docu

165

ments, specific causes of death among
1,387 deceased clergymen during the study
period were ascertained.

For computation of mortality rates,
“person-years of exposure” during the study
period were determined for each single year
of age. The age distribution of the study
group on January 1, 1951 is shown in
Table 1, along with the number of withdrawals (by deposition or death) and person-years of exposure over the following ten
years.

To take advantage of all comparisons to
be made, three series of Standardized
Mortality Ratios (SMR) were calculated.
In the first series, Standard A, the expected
number of deaths entering into mortality
ratios for Episcopal ministers who died at
age 20 and above was computed on the
basis of mortality experience of United
States white males of comparable ages in
1955, the midpoint year of the study period.
This population was chosen as standard
because of common racial background and
the availability of mortality rates for persons age 65 and over. A second series of
standardized mortality ratios, Standard B,
was computed for Episcopal ministers whose
deaths occurred during ages 20 to 64, on
the basis of age-specific death rates in 1950
for total United States males with work experience. This standard was used to compare
the mortality experience of Episcopal! clergymen with available mortality data for
United States learned professions. The third
series of mortality ratios, Standard C, was
computed, using mortality rates for the
United States white clergy in 1950 as
standard, for Episcopal ministers who died
between ages 20 and 64. The selection of
Standard C permits direct comparisons between the study group and the group of
all white clergymen.

For each series of ratios, the expected
number of deaths of Episcopal ministers
was computed by multiplying person-years
of exposure for each age-class (five-year

C) by the age-specific death rates of the
standard population and then summing the
number of deaths in each age-class to yield
the total number of deaths expected. The
standard mortality ratio is the ratio of the
number of deaths observed to the number
expected, expressed as a percentage (standard population equals 100). The number of
deaths from a specific cause is presented in
the tables along with the standardized
mortality ratio to permit readers to assess
the statistical significance of differences in
the SMR’s.

ANGLICAN CLERGYMEN

Mortality data on Anglican clergymen
are based mainly on occupational mortality
statistics, England and Wales, 1949-1953
(Registrar General for England and Wales,
1957), supplemented by statistics compiled
by the Central Board of Finance, the Church
of England for the years 1959, 1963, 1964,

1965, and 1967 (Neuss, 1962, 1965; unpublished data). The age distribution of
clergymen and of deaths shown in both
governmental and church sources is presented in Table 2 for the years included.
The distribution of clergymen by ministerial status in 1959 was parochial ministers,
73%; nonparochial clergymen, 8%; and
retired clergymen, 19% (Neuss, 1962, Table
12). The corresponding figures for 1963 were
64%, 19%, and 17%, respectively (Neuss,
1965, Table 15; “auxiliary” and otherwise

1 Church statistics on clergymen of the Church of
England were based on published (shown in references under Neuss, Ronald F.) and unpublished data
compiled by the Statistical Unit of the Central
Board of Finance. The Statistical Unit maintains
three central statistical registers, one of which deals
with compilation of comprehensive statistics for publication at regular intervals “concerning the numbers, deployment and age structure of all the clergy,
and also statistics of losses through death, retirement, and other causes.” It is now (1965) “considered that the compilation of this register is virtually
complete save for a small number of clergymen
whose exact whereabouts cannot be traced and who
may be living abroad” (Neuss, Ronald F., 1965,

p. 91)

classified are included in the nonparochial
group). The majority of clergymen served
in the home ecclesiastical provinces of
Canterbury and York, being 94% for 1959
and 91% for 1963. Considering the parochial
clergymen in these two provinces alone,
81% had ever been married in 1959 (Neuss,
1962, Table 14; assistant clergymen were
included in the computation of percentage).
Of all parochial clergymen, 45% served in
1963 in communities of 2,999 or under and
3% in communities of 30,000 or more
(Neuss, 1965, Table 25).

Comparison of Episcopal and Anglican
clergymen is restricted to Standards A
and C (for mortality ratios computed for
Anglican clergymen, Standard B, see King,
1970a, Tables 2A, 2B). The ratios computed
from data of the Church of England apply
to all combined causes only. It may be
noted that because of data limitations as to
the age distribution, computation of the
expected number of deaths among Anglican
clergymen, Standard A was based on agespecific death rates of combined five- and
ten-year age classes in the standard population. For the purpose of more objective
comparisons, a second set of SMR’s, Standard A, was computed on the basis of

similarly combined age-classes for Episcopal
ministers and is shown in parentheses in
Table 3.

MAJOR FINDINGS

MORTALITY BY STANDARD A

Table 3 presents data on the observed
number of deaths among Episcopal clergymen by age during the ten-year study period,
and the expected number of deaths in comparison with the general white male population of the United States (Standard A).
For all combined causes, the observed number of deaths in the study group was 1,387,
while 1,928.98 would have occurred if
mortality rates were the same as in the
standard population. The standardized mortality ratio is therefore 1,387/1925.98 or
72%, indicating a 28% deficit in mortality.

Mortality ratios for broad groups of
diseases are shown in the same table. Major
cardiovascular-renal diseases accounted for
the largest number of deaths, also with a
ratio of 72%. However, for some specific
causes in this group, the ratios deviated
greatly from the SMR for the total (Table
4). Sampling variations could account for
this finding of the specific causes with small
numbers of deaths. Malignant neoplasms

ranked next to cardiovascular-renal diseases in number of deaths, with an even
lower mortality ratio of 61%. The ratio
was still lower for stomach cancer, and to a
lesser extent for cancer of the lung and
bronchus. However, mortality ratios were
less depressed for cancers of the intestine
and prostate and perhaps for leukemia. It
is unlikely that these differences were attributed to sampling variation. For some
other causes, such as tuberculosis, suicide,
accidents, and hyperplasia of the prostate,
mortality ratios for the study group were
also low, but the expected number for most
of them was also small. However, the mor

In examining mortality differences among
broad age classes, it is clearly shown in
Table 3 that for all combined causes and for
the three broad disease categories, mortality
ratios for Episcopal clergymen were particularly low among persons under age 45,
and in several older age classes.

all combined causes at ages 20 to 64 was
much lower than that for clergymen age
20 and over (Tables 3, 4). A similarly low
mortality prevailed for most specific causes
of death. However, the high mortality
ratio for coronary heart disease and for
suicide deviated considerably from this
pattern.

When compared with United States
learned professionals, whose mortality has
generally been known to be below average
(Guralnick, 1963, No. 3, Table 2; King and
Bailar, 1968, Table 7; King, 1970a, Tables
2A, 2B), the ratios for total mortality and
for most specific causes of death were much
more favorable for Episcopal ministers
than for physicians, lawyers, and all white
clergymen, but were close to or higher than
those for the teaching profession. It is
further noted that the mortality differentials
between Episcopal clergymen and other
professionals, indicated above, generally
prevailed for most age-classes, as evidenced
by the author’s computation of age-specific
mortality from all combined causes, cardiovascular-renal diseases, and malignant
neoplasms.

Mortality ratios for Episcopal ministers
20 to 64 years old, computed on the basis
of age-specific death rates of the total
group of United States white clergymen
(Standard C), showed a deficit of 33% in
mortality for all combined causes (Table
5). Mortality differentials for most specific
diseases deviated little from that figure, but
mortality ratios for lung cancer and suicide
seemed to be higher than those for the
standard population.

MORTALITY COMPARISONS WITH CLERGYMEN
OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND

Mortality ratios for Anglican clergymen,
based on governmental statistics, are shown
in Table 4 along with ratios for Episcopal
ministers, all of which were adjusted to the
age-specific death rates of United States
white males age 20 and over (Standard
A). For all combined causes, mortality

171

among Episcopal ministers was only 75%
(SMR in parentheses) of that for the standard population, compared to 106% for
Anglican clergymen. A similar difference in
mortality level for Episcopal (low) and
Anglican (high) clergymen was shown in
varying degree with respect to most specific
causes, for example, arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disease (420-422) and its
subgroup, myocardial degeneration (421422), the mortality ratios being 75% vs.
101% for the combined disease group and
59% vs. 346% for the subgroup. In contrast, the mortality ratio for coronary heart
disease (420), another subgroup, was somewhat higher for Episcopal (78%) than for
Anglican (65%) clergymen. Other cardiovascular diseases which showed a lower
mortality ratio for Episcopal than for
Anglican clergymen were strokes (330-334),
74% vs. 135%, and general arteriosclerosis,
74% vs. 102%.

For malignant neoplasms, mortality was
lower for Episcopal than for Anglican clergymen. The ratios were 62% vs. 81% for all
cancers, 39% vs. 98% for stomach cancer,
and 92% vs. 120% for cancer of the intestines. For influenza and pneumonia, the corresponding figures were 92% vs. 183%, and
for hyperplasia of the prostate, 38% vs.
372%. Further, only one death from bronchitis occurred among Episcopal clergymen, while an extremely high mortality
ratio of 1,540 was shown for their Anglican
colleagues. For some other causes, the
general patterns of mortality were reversed
for Episcopal and Anglican clergymen. In
addition to coronary heart disease previously noted, other disparities were shown
for diabetes, suicide, leukemia, and prostatic
cancer, all in favor of Anglican clergymen.
However, the degree of disparity was generally smaller than for those diseases with
mortality patterns favoring the Episcopal
clergymen.

As with Standard A, mortality ratios for
Anglican clergymen adjusted to Standard

172 King

C exceeded the ratios for Episcopal ministers for all combined causes and for most
specific causes, with the exception of hypertension, diabetes, and suicide (Table 5).

It is significant to note, however, that
the higher mortality ratios for all combined
causes shown above for Anglican than for
Episcopal clergymen were not substantiated
when data of the Church of England were
used (Table 6). Thus, for Anglican clergymen age 20 and over the mortality ratio
decreased from 106 to 70 per cent, compared
to 75 per cent for Episcopal ministers. An
even lower ratio was indicated for Anglican
clergymen 20 to 64 than for Anglican (30
vs. 67 percent), and the reverse was true
for clergymen 65 and over (93 vs. 78 per
cent), Interestingly, the disparity in mortality ratios computed from governmental
and non-governmental data was further
corroborated by a similar difference between
the two sets of SMR’s shown in the same
table for British physician, i.e., the ratios
based on the Medical Register data were
much lower than the ones based on governmental statistics. Unfortunately, no comparable data on specific causes of death,
based on Anglican clergymen who were
listed in the church roster, are available for
further analysis.

Social Biology

In examining the age-specific mortality
presented in Table 7, it is clearly shown that
the death rates of Anglican clergymen, computed from the governmental statistics,
greatly exceeded those of Episcopal ministers for all age groups, except age 45 to 54.
However, the age-specific mortality for
Anglican clergymen based on the church
data indicated a relatively smaller excess
only for clergymen age 70 and over, while
clergymen under this age had a more favorable mortality. Considering the great disparity between the two sets of age-specific
mortality computed for the Anglican clergymen, one cannot but suspect reporting
errors in either the governmental or church
statistics, or both.

MORTALITY COMPARISONS WITH
LUTHERAN CLERGYMEN

The favorable mortality among Episcopal
clergymen presented in this paper generally
agrees with that for Lutheran ministers reported earlier (King and Bailar, 1968). For
all combined causes, mortality ratios were
practically the same for the two groups of
clergymen age 20 and over (Standard A:
72% vs. 73%), with a relatively higher
ratio among Episcopal than among Lutheran
clergymen age 20 to 64 (Standard B: 57%

INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS

COMPARISON WITH UNITED STATES WHITE
MALES AND TOTAL MALES WITH
WORK EXPERIENCE

The mortality patterns among Episcopal
clergymen, while generally confirming previous findings on the health of the clerical
profession, are nevertheless difficult to explain. In keeping with the rationale which
we developed for interpreting the study
findings of Lutheran ministers, the extremely low mortality among Episcopal clergymen, compared to that of United States
white males (Standard A) and total males
with work experience (Standard B) should
be attributable largely to socioeconomic

excluding those for Anglican clergymen age 45 and over, 1949-1953, are

class differences. This means that members
of the upper socioeconomic class (including
clergymen) are generally healthier than the
general male population and are therefore
more likely to enter and complete college
and seminary training. Further, the ministerial profession, like other learned professions (U.S. Public Health Service, 1965,
Tables 5 and 7; U.S. Public Health Service,
1963, Nos. 3 and 5, Table 1) would have a
favorable influence on an incumbent’s
health. Differences in mortality between
Episcopal ministers and other United States
learned professionals would be largely related to the ways of living in a given profession and their interaction with a host of
other factors (for further discussion, see
King, 1970a).

COMPARISON WITH UNITED STATES WHITE
CLERGYMEN AND LUTHERAN MINISTERS

As with Standards A and B, subsocioeconomic class differences within the clerical
profession would have contributed to a
lower mortality (Standard C) among Episcopal ministers than among the total group
of United States white clergymen, since the
latter includes clergymen of low socioeconomic standing, many of whom are partDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

time ministers. Other significant factors
with varying degrees of influence could be
the generally known errors in the reporting
of occupation and age in census and mortality statistics and differences in marital status,
ethnic origin, geographic residence, churchsanctioned behavior, or church organization, for which similar inferences may be
drawn from our previous discussion on mortality differentials between United States
white clergymen and Lutheran ministers
(King and Bailar, 1968).

The similarity in mortality patterns for
clergymen of the Episcopal and Lutheran
churches would be substantially related to
some of the social characteristics commonly
shared by the two clerical groups, such as
social origin and educational background.
For example, the overall low mortality and
the smaller reduction for leukemia are in
keeping with the general mortality patterns
of United States professionals (U.S. Public
Health Service, 1963, Vol. 5, Table 1). How
Social Biology

ever, the smaller reductions in mortality for
cancers of the intestines and prostate (even
though also common among professionals),
together with the disparity in mortality
ratio for diabetes (high for Episcopal) and
for cancer of the pancreas (high for Lutheran) preclude immediate explanation.

COMPARISON BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND BRITAIN

In comparing mortality ratios between
Anglican (computed from the governmental
data) and Episcopal clergymen, it is interesting to note that for all combined causes
and for most specific causes, differences are
generally in the same direction as those between males with work experience in Britain
and white males in the United States
(Table 8). (For Anglo-American comparisons of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, see: Holland, 1965; Reid, 1960;
Reid and Rose, 1964; Reid et al. 1965,
1967.) However, the marked difference in

mortality ratios for all combined causes
for the Anglican clergymen depending on
the source of information (106% from
government statistics vs. 70% from church
data compared to 75% for the Episcopal
clergymen) suggests possible errors in reporting of age and occupation in census and
mortality statistics (Registrar General for
England and Wales, 1957a, p. 131), and/or
registration gaps in the church data, One
would also suspect that the census definition of clergymen excluded those who were
not engaged in primary church activities.
Such discrepancies can only be resolved
through further validation of both sets of
statistics,

Aside from sources of data, other speculations may be attempted as possible explanations for mortality differences between Anglican and Episcopal clergymen.
One factor is the geographic distribution of
clergymen. Since the majority of British
vicars served, as noted earlier, in less urbanized communities, one may question
whether Anglican clergymen as a group did
actually experience a lower degree of occupational role stress than their American
counterparts, as has generally been assumed. In this connection Emrich (1960,
p. 49) commented after preaching in three
British parishes that in all of them were “‘fine
parish clergy who are doing far too much.”
Further studies are needed of role stress and
other possible influences stemming from
differences in clerical geographical distribution such as the availability and quality
of medical services or general environmental
risk,

Another factor may be related to marital
status. As previously indicated, a higher
proportion of Episcopal than Anglican parish ministers had ever been married, but
the precise effect on mortality level of adjustment for marital differentials remains to
be determined.

We shall consider next the possible influence of socioeconomic class, to which the

Clerical Mortality Patterns

175

low mortality among Episcopal ministers
had been attributed. In his analysis of
patterns of recruitment for the Anglican
ministry, Coxon (1965, 1967) suggested
that between 1870 and the 1960’s the
“normal” group of graduates ordained each
year has gone through a period of attrition, complemented by the growth of the
“late” group. The characteristics (including
among others, presumably, personal health,
or so this author would conjecture) of the
latter compared to the former are much
more typical of the general population. The
possible influence, if any, of such a transition on the health of Anglican clergymen
as a group remains to be shown. No comparable data are available for the trends in
social origin among Episcopal clergymen.

Finally, a word is in order on some of
the common characteristics of clergymen
of the Anglican Communion which would
have bearing on health. For example, although the use of tobacco and liquor is
permitted for Episcopal and Anglican clergymen, little is known about differences in
kind and extent of such consumption. Further, both groups of clergymen are appointed with perpetual tenure (known as
“parson’s freehold” in Britain) and may
be removed only with difficulty for such
reasons as spectacular misbehavior or eccentricities in teaching (which were said
to be especially cherished by the British
vicars, according to Hamblin, 1965). Since
an Anglican parochial clergyman serves an
average number of about 7 years in the
same parish (Neuss, 1962, Table 24; no
comparable data available for Episcopal
clergymen), it would be interesting to
conduct a study of the health implications
of such a tenure system in a “‘congregational’ type of church organization (Smith,
1953; Rodehaver and Smith, 1951).

CONCLUSIONS

Several findings are interesting and significant, one of which concerns some of the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

176 King

disease-specific mortality differences between clergymen of the Anglican Communion residing in Britain and those in the
United States such as, on the one hand,
arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disease, strokes, cancers of the stomach and
intestines, and hyperplasia of the prostate
(high for Anglican) and on the other hand,
diabetes, suicide, leukemia, and prostatic
cancer (high for Episcopal). This points to
the need for gaining better insight into the
dissimilar health risks of the ministerial
profession in relation to different sociocultural and geographic settings.

Another finding is that the mortality
patterns of Episcopal clergymen are quite
similar to those of Lutheran ministers reported earlier. While this seems to reflect
the common socioeconomic standing shared
by the two ministerial groups, it nevertheless requires further substantiation, particularly, for example, the commonly shared
smaller reductions in mortality for cancers
of the intestines and prostate and for
leukemia, as well as certain disease-specific
mortality differences such as diabetes (higher for Episcopal than for Lutheran) and
cancer of the pancreas (higher for Lutheran
than for Episcopal). It would be especially
rewarding to compare the mortality patterns of Episcopal and Lutheran ministers
with the study findings of clerical populations with a different social background.

The findings from our study of a more
favorable mortality among the clerical than
among the general population, while being
consistent with those previously reported,
necessitate detailed ascertainment and exploration of new clues through further
studies of denominations at both national
and cross-national levels.

Social Biology

A further finding pertains to the accuracy
of occupational mortality statistics on the
clerical profession (and possibly other
learned professions as well), for example, the
disparity between mortality ratios computed from the governmental data and those
based on church statistics. This suggests
the need for a critical evaluation of the
census and mortality statistics for the
clerical and other learned professions, as
well as a systematic documentation of more
adequate data for the church and professional organizations.

Finally, but not least in significance, it
seems appropriate on the basis of the results
obtained from studies of the clergy as a
religious population to conduct comprehensive inquiries of occupation-centered
health risks of the clerical profession and to
compare the findings with those of other
learned professions, preferably in accordance with a conceptual study scheme presented elsewhere (King, 1966, 1970a, 19708).
