ABSTRACT: Reproductive patterns were studied from data collected in 1,450 Berber households
in the province of Marrakesh, Morocco in 1984. Women aged 45-49 years had a mean of 8.9
pregnancies to achieve 5.7 living children. Social influences on fertility rates show the importance
of tradition, particularly through time-dependent variables such as age at marriage, waiting time
to first birth, interbirth intervals, and duration of breastfeeding. Birth contro! does not appear
to affect the tempo of fertility; rather, its main use is to bring the reproductive period to a close.
The comparison of two subsamples of women separated by a 25-year interval indicates an actual
acceleration of the tempo of fertility by the reduction of waiting time to first birth and of
interbirth intervals. The supposed ongoing process of demographic transition is not clearly

observed in this population.

Nagi (1983), analyzing the numerOus studies performed in Muslim countries on fertility trends and their effects
upon demography and social structures, questioned whether there was
any evidence of a demographic transition in these societies, since fertility
rates remain high despite economic
development and a drop in mortality
rates. Therefore, Nagi proposed a separate concept of family—its place and
significance in social life as well as its
size—for Muslim countries in comparison with Western societies.

Morocco, like other Muslim nations
of North Africa, has undergone economic and social changes since midcentury, which began in the main cities
and their surroundings and gradually
involved more remote areas. Paralleling this evolution, the crude birth rate
dropped from 49 per thousand in 1965
to 35.3 per thousand in 1987 (U.N.,
1990), an intermediary position compared with Algeria (50 and 47.2 per

thousand, respectively), and Tunisia
(46 and 28.2 per thousand). In spite of
a drop of some 28 per cent in 23 years,
Moroccan fertility remains high. The
mean data available for urban and
rural areas in the province of Marrakesh still average 6.5 and 8.3 full-term
births per woman, respectively, at the
end of reproductive life (Crognier and
Zarouf, 1987; Crognier, 1989).

The present work analyzes data of
reproductive life collected in the southern part of the province of Marrakesh
from a Berber population ranging from
the piedmont of the Atlas Mountains
to an altitude of about 2,500 feet.
Though predominantly rural, this sample also includes the population of a
small town at a primary level of urbanization.

ior, and medical assistance was collected in 1,450 households of the
“circle” of Amizmiz, an administrative
subdivision of the province of Marrakesh. At the same time the reproductive history of each woman in the
household was traced, including age at
menarche, age at first marriage, age at
menopause, waiting time to first birth,
successive pregnancies with their outcomes, sex of the children, conditions
of parturition, durations of lactation,
and the children’s vaccinations, present ages or age at death and the cause
of death, and contraceptive practice
during interbirth intervals.

The investigations were conducted
during two successive field trips. The
first, in October 1984, was part of a
general fertility survey in Marrakesh.
One household out of ten in areas accessible to district nurses was sampled,
resulting in 843 records (618 in villages
and 225 in the town of Amizmiz). This
sampling covered the lowlands of the
area up to an altitude of 1,500 feet. The
second field trip aimed at gathering information about communities settled
in mountain valleys far more difficult
to access. It included nine villages scattered in the valley of Azgour (at an altitude of from 2,200 to 2,500 feet)
which were exhaustively investigated
during July of 1986 and of 1987 (Naber,
1989), resulting in 607 records. The
overall sampling should provide a good
record of living conditions and reproductive behaviors in this homogenous
Berber-speaking area.

Since people in this area do not
record reproductive events and birth
registers are imprecise, the data are an
approximation of ages or spans of time
(in years or months). The resulting information, though well checked, is not

suitable for sophisticated analysis, in
particular for model fitting.

RESULTS
MAIN REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS

Table 1 shows the cumulated means
of total births, of spontaneous abortions, of stillbirths, of live births, and
of children dead and alive at the time
of investigation in each female age
class.

The discrepancy between fertility
scores of women aged 45-49 years and
those of the last age class may illustrate
differential reproductive success related to the improvement of living conditions. However, it is probably a reflection of memory lapses resulting
from the extensive number of reproductive events.

The high level of fertility is combined with a high rate of infant and juvenile mortality. Women aged 45-49
years have a mean of 8.9 pregnancies
to achieve a mean of 5.7 living children. This profile seems close to “‘natural fertility’ (Henry, 1961), i.e., with
no contraception or induced abortion,
in spite of the intense governmental
policy of family planning developed
from 1968-72 onward. Although 40
per cent of women in the sample declare that they are using or have used
contraception, this record is a poor one
if we consider that since the 70’s contraceptives (the pill) have been freely
distributed. The proportion of contraceptors also varies with age, ranging
from 34 per cent in the women’s age
class 15-19 years up to 60 per cent in
the age range 25-45, when women
have already experienced 3 to 9 pregnancies. In its present use, contracep

tion therefore mainly regulates the late
reproductive period.

BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL
DETERMINANTS OF FERTILITY

In most societies, the effective onset
of reproductive life is subsequent to a
social event—marriage. Age at marriage is therefore a major determinant
of fertility. When identified with the
function of procreation, it entails that
the waiting time to first birth only expresses the latency resulting from the
addition of the time to fecundation and
the duration of pregnancy. In many
traditional societies, moreover, the age
at marriage is closely related to physical development, so that age at menarche and age at marriage are highly
correlated. .

Besides the age at marriage, the
type of union affects reproductive life.

In particular, polygyny affects reproduction for a variety of reasons, including a different social selection of
mates, a higher frequency of sterility, a
higher lability of union, etc. (White,
1982; Ahmed, 1986; Bean and Mineau,
1986; Pison, 1986; Pison, 1986; Adewuyi, 1988; Johnson and Elmi, 1989).
Most observations indicate a negative
association of polygyny with female cumulative fertility, at the group level.

Polygyny is practiced in Morocco,
and polygynous matings are 11.5 per
cent of the present material. They will
be considered separately in the following analysis.

The mean recollected age at menarche (14.5 years) is still late in this
population (Table 2) although coherent with a previous estimate by the
status-quo method for the city of Marrakesh (14.10 years, Loukid, 1989).

“Reproductive span = interval between age at marriage and age at last birth computed from a subsample of women aged more
than 45 years. Total sample # = 398. monogamous a = 330: polygynous 1 = 58).

The differences in age groups, in methods of evaluation, and the frequent
discrepancies between rural and urban
environments would account for the
variation observed.

Still, considering the total sample,
there is a significant (r = 0.23, P<
0.0001) but loose correlation between
age at menarche and age at marriage,
inconsistent with the hypothesis that
marriage could be directed by physical
maturation as found elsewhere (e.g.,
r = 0.97 in Kenya, Bogerhoff Mulder,
1989). The length of the waiting time to
first birth is independent of both age at
menarche (r = 0.02) and age at marriage (r = —0.05), thus discrediting the
hypothesis of a catch-up of fertility,
when either menarche or marriage occur late (as observed in Malaysia by
Hirschman and Rindfuss, 1980). There
is consequently a high correlation between age at marriage and age at first
birth (r = 0.90, P< 0.0001).

Observed from a subsample of elder
women, supposed to have completed
fertility (i.e., aged more than 45
years), the mean reproductive span estimated as the interval of time between
marriage and last birth is important. It
is in the range of those found in devel
 

oping countries, though greater than
observed in a comparable country such
as rural Egypt by Horne (1989) (x = 15
to 18 years). However, Horne estimates the span as the interval between
the first and the last birth and limits the
sample to women aged 45-49 years
having borne at least two children. The
application of her estimate of the reproductive span to our sample gives
similar results (¥ = 17.6 years in the
total sample; 17.9 years in the monogamous group and 15.6 years in the
polygynous group. In the Moroccan
sample as in the Egyptian one is observed an association between age at
marriage and length of reproductive
span (r = —0.22, P<0.0001) and a
high correlation between span and parity (r = 0.73, P<0.0001).

These results suggest that the date
of onset and the number of successive
pregnancies account principally for the
extent of the reproductive period, regardless of interval lengths between
births. Such characteristics shape a pattern of natural fertility (Henry, 1961),
which could fit the present population
until the possible occurrence of birth
control over late natality. This latter
hypothesis is supported by the exist

ence of a significant correlation between ages at first and last birth
(r = 0.24, P<0.0001), thus indicating
that women who married early would
complete childbearing earlier than
women who married late (Trussel,
1979). According to Naber (1989) and
Varea (1990), the end of childbearing
could be subsequent to the women becoming grandmothers.

Polygyny in Morocco, though it can
express different social and economic
situations (Crognier and Zarouf, 1987;
Crognier, 1990), shows the conservative aspect of local culture. In this
study, it is more frequent among older
people, hence the discrepancy between
mean ages of monogamous and polygynous samples (difference = 5.75
years). It is associated with a mean
later age at marriage and a mean
greater waiting time to first birth, resulting in a mean older age at first birth
(difference = 1.34 year) and a mean
shorter span of reproductive life (difference = 1.9 year).

TIMING OF REPRODUCTION

The recollection of each woman’s
reproductive events, summed at sample level, expresses the collective behaviors related to fertility. The outcomes of pregnancies, the conditions
of confinement, the duration of breastfeeding, and the length of interbirth
intervals are successively considered
according to the parity order.

The outcomes of successive pregnancies until the eleventh degree of
parity are characterized by a quasi stable percentage of live births (above
90 per cent). The percentage of spontaneous abortions varies from 2 to 5
per cent, and the frequency of still

195

births (considered as deaths occurring
during and later than the seventh
month of pregnancy) from 4 to 5 per
cent. The first are obviously underreported (early miscarriages before
three months are never mentioned),
and the second are probably overestimated.

Intrauterine mortality, considered
as a whole, would range from 7 per
cent of total pregnancies for the first
parities to 16 per cent and more by the
twelfth. This doubling of the average
rate, associated with age through increasing parities, is commonly observed (Leridon, 1977). Its level also
agrees with general estimates, either in
developing or developed populations
(from 12 to 15 per cent, according to
Leridon, 1977, and Bongaarts and Potter, 1983) and is similar to figures obtained by age classes (9 to 14 per cent)
for the city of Marrakesh by Bley and
Baali (1987).

The traditional home confinement,
with the help of either a parent or a
neighbor acting as midwife, remains
the prevalent mode of delivery. Confinements in public or private maternity centers are rare and seem to be associated with difficulties in pregnancy
or parturition. They correlate with a
higher percentage of failures at any
degree of parity.

Breastfeeding records were taken
from a subsample of women selected
for having undertaken lactation and
maintained it until the weaning of their
child. For a total of 5,681 records, the
mean duration of breastfeeding was
17.58 months (SD 6.02) and breastfeeding ranged from 1 to 36 months.
The customary span of breastfeeding is
therefore extensive in this population.
Differences appear with respect to

marital status (monogamous or polygynous), with respective means of
17.71 and 16.45 months (t = 4.78,
P<0.001). A difference in the duration of breastfeeding is also found between contraceptors and noncontraceptors, with respective means of
17.12 and 17.98 months (t = 6.946,
P<0.001). .

The observations in relation to parity (Table 3) showed a moderate trend
toward the increase of lactation time
with parity. On the other hand, no sex
differences occurred in the length of
lactation whatever the parity, thus negating the hypothesis of possible discrimination between boys and girls.

The mean interbirth interval computed from the whole data (6,019 measures) is 30.06 (SD 19.9 months). Its
span is longer among women of polygynous marital status than among
monogamous (respectively x = 32.4,

SD = 21.5, and x = 29.8, SD = 19.8

months, t = 2.91, P< 0.05), a result in
agreement with the general appraisal
of the effects of polygyny.

On the other hand, contraceptive
practices do not appear to entail significantly longer interbirth intervals as
the respective means of contraceptors
and noncontraceptors are 29.61 (SD
17.9) and 30.43 (SD 21.4 months)
(t = 1.61 ns). Insofar as birth control is
effective, this result agrees with the hypothesis that contraception is implemented to end the reproductive period
when family size is considered to be
completed.

The interbirth interval considered in
the successive parities varies between
26 and 37 months (Table 4), the largest
interval being the first. When records
of completed lactation and corresponding interbirth intervals are simul

and significant correlation (0.08 <r<

the lengthening of breastfeeding entails a protracted amenorrhea and
hence a subsequent longer interbirth
interval.

THE EVOLUTION OF REPRODUCTIVE
BEHAVIORS

Insofar as the sample of women investigated includes persons ranging
from 15 to more than 50 years old, it is
possible to segregate from it two subsamples representing two generations
separated by an interval of age averaging approximately 25 years. Table 5
expresses the main characteristics of
these two subsamples.

The change in maturation rate during the intergeneration interval is moderate and would indicate the stability
of living conditions within the area during this period. Women’s age at marriage is traditionally early in Morocco
and rather stable, whatever the period
or the environment (Crognier, 1992).
Conversely, a strong behavioral shift
toward the reduction of the waiting
time to first birth is noticeable: a 7.6
months drop In an interval of 25 years.
Considering the stability of age at marriage, this drop leads to an earlier age
at first birth.

This evolution is also perceptible in
the level of association between these
variables (Table 6). The younger generation appears to take a greater notice
of age at puberty to set the age at marriage. It also shows a weak, negative,
but significant correlation between age

at marriage and the length of the waiting time to first birth, a possible indication of a catch-up of fertility when
marriage is late.

Among labile reproductive behaviors are the durations of interbirth intervals and of breastfeeding practices.
The comparison of lactation spans cumulated for the first five degrees of parity in the two subsamples shows an effective shift in this 25-year interval,
from a mean value of 18.26 months
(> 40 years) to 14.92 months (< 30
years), i.e., a mean reduction of 3.34
months (t = 12.61, P<0.0001).

Interbirth intervals show the same
evolution. Computed over the first five
intervals, their mean values are respectively 31.87 months ( > 40 years)
and 27.40 months (<30 years), a
mean drop of 4.46 months (¢ = 6.05,
P <0.0001).

CONCLUSION

The observation of reproductive
patterns in this Berber population of
Morocco seems to agree with other
trends in this society (Crognier, 1992),
those in which individual behaviors,
though molded by a still-strong traditional model, reflect influences from
developed societies.

This bipolarization appears in the
reproductive life. The former influence, summarized by the high level of
fertility, stems from traditional behaviors regarding age at marriage, waiting
time to first birth, lactation duration,
and above all the apparent absence of
birth limitation. It results in a fertility
pattern seemingly close to a natural
pattern of fertility, at least until the
family is considered completed.

On the other hand, the changes observed in the younger age groups
would indicate an acceleration of family constitution by the shortening of
behavior-dependent time intervals (either relevant to individual desires or
subsequent to the improvement of fertility by medical assistance. Insofar as
the reproductive period of this generation is not yet achieved, we cannot
forecast whether this new pattern will
lead to a shorter reproductive span and
a smaller family size or not.

Following Nagi’s observations in
Muslim countries (1983), the Moroccan data as a whole are not demonstrative of a clear demographic transition.
Even in Moroccan cities, the mean
number of live-born children per completed family (women aged 45-49
years), still averaged 6.36 in 1982
(Direction de la Statistique, 1984). It
seems reasonable to assume the
mountain-dwelling Berbers will maintain, for some time at least, their traditional reproductive behaviors.
