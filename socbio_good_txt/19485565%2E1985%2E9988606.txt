Individual Differences in Sensitivity
and Tolerance to Alcohol

ABSTRACT: Human responses to alcohol—especially sensitivity and acute behavioral
tolerance—are being studied within a behavioral genetic design involving comparisons of scores
from monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, nontwin siblings, and unrelated (adoptee) pairs
reared in the same family from infancy. The planned genetic analyses must await completion of
data collection. The present sample is, however, adequate for analyses of means and for some
analyses of individual differences in responses. For most of the measures being used, we find the
usual mean decrement in performance after alcohol dosing to 0.100 BAC, but individual differences in response to alcohol are large, and a few individuals actually improve in performance
after dosing. Also, on two tests, Cancellation and Block Rotations, there is a significant mean
improvement in performance immediately after dosing. As yet we do not have a satisfactory
explanation for this phenomenon. On most but not all of the tests, performance improves after
the initial decrement during a 3-hour period in which blood alcohol levels are maintained by
additional hourly doses. This improvement may be due in part to practice effects, as well as to
the development of acute behavioral tolerance to ethanol (ABTE). We are still exploring ways
in which these effects may be disentangled, using data from concurrent placebo control subjects
and from pre-dosing test sessions. It is already apparent, nevertheless, that most of the variability in sensitivity and ABTE is related to pre-existing individual variability rather than to gender, age, height, weight, or drinking history. By mailing annual questionnaires to all participants, we hope to be able to test the hypothesis that those who were relatively insensitive to
ethanol or who showed a relatively large amount of ABTE during the test sessions may be at
increased risk for heavy alcohol consumption.

Our perspective as behavioral geneticists led us to focus on individual differ
Although individual differences in
responses to alcohol were noted in early

research (e.g., Jellinek and McFarland,
1940), the dozens of studies conducted
during the past two decades have focused on the average impairment produced by alcohol. For obvious reasons,
some studies have attempted to identify
the blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
required to produce significant mean effects (e.g., Donovan et al., 1983), and
other studies have considered the types
of processes most affected on the average by alcohol (e.g., Mills and Bixgrove,
1983).

ences in responses to alcohol rather than
average performance for several reasons: (1) For mice, men, and fruit flies,
genetic variation among individuals is
ubiquitous. At least half of all loci are
significantly polymorphic for each species. (2) Genetic variability among individuals relates to observed variability
among individuals for a wide range of
biobehavioral characteristics. Thus, genetic variation among individuals is
likely to be an important source of individuals’ responses to alcohol as well. (3)

Alcohol abuse is an individual differences problem—that is, we want to
know why some individuals abuse alcohol and others do not. Our goal is to use
behavioral genetic techniques to describe and explain individual differences
in reactions to administered alcohol as
possible predictors of subsequent alcohol abuse.

Clearly, alcohol abuse is one of the
greatest problems in our society today.
Surveys consistently find that 10 per cent
of adult Americans who drink experience alcohol-related problems. Behavioral genetic studies suggest that heredity plays a major role in predisposing
individuals toward alcohol abuse: With
a single first-degree relative who is alcoholic, one’s risk of becoming an alcoholicis about 1 in 5. Furthermore, adoption studies suggest that this risk is the
same even when an individual is
adopted away from the alcoholic relative at birth, a finding that strongly implicates genetic factors in alcohol abuse
(e.g., DeFries and Plomin, 1978).

The Colorado Alcohol Research on
Twins and Adoptees (CARTA) is a prospective study of alcohol abuse in a large
population of social drinkers who are
members of familial pairs useful for
quantitative genetic analysis: identical
twins, fraternal twins, nontwin siblings,
and adoptees. The focus of CARTA is
the description and explanation of individual differences in responses to administered alcohol and their relationship to later changes in patterns of
alcohol consumption. The responses of
particular interest to us are initial sensitivity following consumption of alcohol
and the acquisition of acute tolerance,
the diminished effect of the same BAC
as a drinking session proceeds. Because
factors such as drinking history, gender,
age, and weight can affect individual dif

ferences in responses to alcohol, we
define sensitivity and acute tolerance as
independent of these other factors. We
wish to study the possibility that these
responses to alcohol might be indices of
risk for alcohol abuse along the lines of
the following hypothesis: Individuals
who are less sensitive to the initial effects of alcoho] and individuals who, independent of sensitivity, quickly develop acute tolerance are more likely to
be at risk for alcohol abuse simply because such individuals are likely to consume more alcohol than individuals who
are sensitive to the initial effects of alcohol and those who do not develop acute
tolerance. This hypothesis fits the prevailing view that genetic influence on alcohol abuse does not involve genes that
push an individual to abuse alcohol.
Rather, genetic variability results in
some individuals not having the normal
curbs on drinking. Genetic influence on
alcohol abuse may not be as much a matter of a larger engine driving some individuals to drink as it as a matter of
weaker brakes for stopping. The importance of finding such risk factors lies in
the great cost of alcoho! abuse to our
society—estimated to be far greater
than the costs of cancer—coupled with
the one sure finding from treatment research which indicates that alcohol
abuse is treated best when it is treated
early, before the social supports of family and occupation dissolve.

As mentioned earlier, previous behavioral genetic studies have demonstrated genetic influence on the amount
of alcohol consumed and on alcoholism.
The goal of CARTA 1s to consider mediators and mechanisms of alcohol use
in order to understand the processes by
which alcohol abuse develops, to identify predictors of alcohol abuse, and to
consider the etiology of this nexus of reDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

lationships using the techniques of
quantitative genetics. Our previous
study in this area involved 29 brother
pairs in Hawaii (Wilson et al., 1983;
Wilson et al., 1984). Two doses of ethanol were administered; the first dose
(0.8 g/kg) was designed to yield a BAC
of 0.100 g/dl. A half-hour battery of tests
was administered three times prior to
consumption of alcohol (to establish
base performance) and three times at
hourly intervals during the 3-4 hours
while each subject’s BAC as assessed by
an intoximeter declined to 50 per cent of
its peak value. At that time, another
dose of ethanol was administered (45
per cent of the initial dosage) and the
test battery was presented three more
times. A broad range of tasks was employed: gross motor tasks such as rail
walking and body sway, simple perceptual speed measures such as reaction
time and cancellation, hand-eye coordination measures such as pursuit rotor
and dowel balancing, and measures further downstream in the cognitive processing flow of information such as spatial
tasks and those that require logic. We
also used an electronic video game as a
measure of general functioning.

In that preliminary study, the measures were reasonably reliable, and data
for control subjects for whom a small
amount of ethanol (about 3-4 ml) was
floated on top of their otherwise
alcohol-free drink indicate that performance of sober subjects remained
largely unchanged during the repeated
testing. One particularly interesting
finding was that the slope of the linear
portion of the alcohol clearance curve
was found to decline more steeply after
the second dose of alcohol, a reliable
phenomenon which we labeled Acute
Metabolic Tolerance to Ethanol

Wilson and Plomin

Social Biology

(AMTE; Wilson et al., 1984). In addition, for most measures, significant decrements in performance were observed
on the average immediately following
consumption of the first dose of alcohol.
One novel result concerns acute tolerance: After the second dose of alcohol,
performance was little impaired on average even though BAC was approximately at the same moderate level.
Most impressive, however, was the wide
range of reliable individual differences
for both sensitivity and acute tolerance.

The small number of sibling pairs did
not yield much power to detect familial
resemblance for sensitivity and acute
tolerance. However, some familiality
was found. A preliminary report of an
Australian twin study suggests that initial responses to alcohol are likely to be
influenced by genetic factors (Martin,
1983). The Australian study was much
like the first part of our Hawaiian study
in that a single dose of alcohol was administered and then reaction time, coordination, and steadiness were measured. Significant genetic influence on
psychomotor performance following alcohol consumption was found. Interestingly, the increase in variance of performance often noted following alcohol
consumption appears to be genetic in origin.

Our preliminary Hawaiian study and
the Australian study gave us the confidence needed to undertake CARTA, a
prospective, quantitative genetic study
of 450 individuals, each tested for a 12hour session. CARTA will eventually
include 50 pairs each of identical twins
and fraternal twins (to assess genetic influence), nontwin siblings (to explore
the possibility that twins share more
similar family environments than do
nontwin siblings), and adoptees (to as

sess directly the influence of shared family environment). Other differences between CARTA and our first study
include the use of a somewhat broader
battery of tests and the inclusion of females as well as males. As described
later, the test battery includes additional
measures such as measures of information processing and evoked potentials.
Females are included for two reasons.
First, nearly all studies of the effects of
alcohol are limited to males, and we
need to learn more about alcohol’s effects on females. Secondly, our questionnaire studies and data presented in
this article indicate that, once gender
differences in body weight are controlled, there are no important gender
differences in alcohol consumption or in
responses to administered alcohol.

Another difference between
CARTA and our earlier research involves an attempt to bring our laboratory administration of alcohol one step
closer to drinking outside the laboratory. Administering a single dose of alcohol as in nearly all previous studies of
the effects of alcohol, or even administering two doses as in our Hawaiian
study, leads to a roller coaster pattern of
BAC which does not typify normal
drinking patterns. A large dose is also
administered initially in CARTA. However, several smaller doses are then administered in an attempt maintain BAC
at approximately 0.100 g/dl for 3 hours.
This procedure provides a cleaner test of
acute tolerance, and it also approximates normal drinking patterns to a
greater extent than do the single-dose
studies.

This paper will focus on individual
differences in sensitivity and acute tolerance. Although we predict that genetic
variability will account substantially for

165

these differences in responses to alcohol, quantitative genetic analysis must
await the testing of approximately three
times as many subjects. We expect to
complete testing in‘about three years.
The prediction of alcohol abuse from individual differences in sensitivity and
acute tolerance provides the foundation
for these later analyses and also leads to
an interesting story in itself, one rife
with social implications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS

The subjects for this report were 23
men and 30 women between the ages of
21 and 55 who had volunteered to participate in the Colorado Alcohol Research on Twins and Adoptees
(CARTA). In the preliminary screening
all had confirmed that they had used alcohol but denied that they had any problems associated with alcohol use; would
not take any medications or drugs (with
the exception of nicotine) for at least 12
hours before testing; were taking no
medications or drugs that would contraindicate the use of alcohol; had no medical problems such as diabetes that would
preclude their taking alcohol; and, in
the case of women, were not pregnant
or planning to become pregnant. Each
subject was also a member of a pair of
monozygotic twins, dyzygotic twins, or
nontwin siblings, or a member of an
adopted/biological offspring pair reared
in the same family from infancy (less
than 12 months of age). These relationships are required for the behavioral genetic analyses which will be conducted
when the group numbers are adequate,
but are not further discussed here. Each
subject agreed to report for testing at

166

0800 hours without having taken any
food or drink (except water) or drugs
(except nicotine) since dinner the previous evening. Subjects were tested individually and were paid as partial compensation for their assistance.

PROCEDURES

A personal history and alcohol use
questionnaire had been mailed to each
subject and, in most cases, the subject
reported for testing with the completed
questionnaire. In a few cases a subject
forgot to bring the questionnaire, but
agreed to mail it in, or filled out another.
During the preliminary interview at
about 0800 hours, the subject was interviewed to confirm absence of any contraindications to dosing with alcohol, to
insure an adequate understanding of the
procedures to be used (for informed

- consent), to confirm that he/she had fol
lowed the fasting instructions, and to
obtain a short pedigree. A breath alcohol test was then conducted; no subjects
showed any trace of alcohol. Next, the
subject was measured for height and
weight and was given a vocabulary test
and Raven’s Progressive Matrices test,
with the instructions that he/she should
take the time needed to try to get each
item correct (untimed, power tests).
The purpose of these tests was to estimate subject’s 1Q. During the vocabulary test, the subject was given a small
standard breakfast of two pieces of
whole wheat toast, 6 ounces of orange
juice, and 8 ounces of skim milk.
Baseline (pre-alcohol) performance
was then assessed by administering a
standard 30-minute test battery three
times (Pre-1, Pre-2, Pre-3). The Pre-1
test battery typically took more than 30
minutes for completion, as each test was
explained thoroughly before it was

given. The use of three preliminary testing sessions before alcohol dosage represents a compromise. Since the intent
during this phase is to measure base
level responses or capability for each
person, it would perhaps be better to
continue preliminary testing until practice effects are no longer evident. However, this would mean a variable (and,
perhaps, large) number of sessions for
each subject and would very likely be
self-defeating in that some subjects
would become too fatigued or bored to
continue with the alcohol sessions. The
adoption of the three-session paradigm
seems to be working reasonably well, as
estimates of practice effects are generally small, as described later. The tests
that comprise the battery are described
below.

ALCOHOL DOSAGE

With the goal of achieving a blood alcohol concentration of 0.100 g/dl, the
subject was weighed, and an amount of
USP grade 95 per cent ethanol was measured out, based on the formula 0.8
grams of absolute ethanol per kilogram
body weight. The ethanol dose was then
mixed with a volume (about 450 ml) ofa
sugar- and caffeine-free soft drink seven
times the volume of the ethanol, and divided into 10 small cups. The subject
was instructed to drink one small cupful
every 1.5 minutes, so that the full dose
would be taken within 15 minutes. In a
few cases a subject expressed dislike for
sugar-free drinks, and was offered the
choice of carbonated water for dilution
of the ethanol. After taking the ethanol
dose, the subject was instructed to rise
out his/her mouth several times with tap
water to eliminate ethanol from the
teeth and oral mucosa. After an initial
absorption period of 10 minutes, a

breath alcohol reading (BrAC) was
taken, and subsequent readings were
obtained every 10 minutes for 3 hours
using an Iritoxilyzer (Omicron Systems
Corporation). The test battery (Post-1)
was given during the 10- to 40-minute
portion of the hour after initial alcohol
dosing, during the ascending limb of the
blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
curve.

With the goal of maintaining BAC at
about 0.100 g/dl, supplemental doses of
ethanol were given, based on the following criteria: If, at the end of the first hour
after initial dosing, the BrAC was below
70 per cent of the peak value after the
initial dose, a supplemental dose of ethanol equal to 30 per cent of the original
dose was given. If BrAC was between 71
per cent and 85 per cent, the supplement
was 20 per cent of the initial dose. If
BrAC was between 86 per cent and 100
per cent, the supplement was 10 per
cent. After the subject rinsed his/her
mouth and teeth, the 30-minute test battery was given again (Post-2). At the end
of 2 hours after the initial dose of alcohol, another supplementary dose was
given in an analogous manner, and the
test battery was repeated (Post-3). For
most subjects (exceptions are noted below), these procedures resulted in maintenance of BrAC at or near 0.100 g/dl
for 3 hours, thus allowing 3 hourly assessments of performance while at this
BrAC. When BrAC had been reduced
by metabolism to one-half the peak
value achieved by each subject (about
3-6 hours after initial dosage for most
subjects), another testing session (Post4) was conducted.

TEST BATTERY

The alcohol use questionnaire mentioned earlier is a lengthy questionnaire

167

developed as part of our previous research (Gabrielli and Plomin, 1985).
Questions include how often beer, wine,
and hard liquor were drunk during the
past year and how much was usually
consumed per session. For the purposes
of this report, we used this information
to estimates grams of ethanol consumed
per month. During each of the 30minute test sessions, each subject
(tested singly) completed the following
tests in the order indicated:

1. Body temperature is taken by
means of a quick reading thermometer
covered by a thin film disposable cover.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are
taken using a W.A. Baum, Inc.
‘“‘Baumanometer” (sphygmomanometer). Heart rate is taken by counting the
pulse at the wrist for 15 seconds.

2. Body sway is measured by having
the subject stand facing a wall 15 cm
away, with feet together and arms re~laxed at the sides. The subject is instructed to relax, stand still, and avoid
talking while a 30-second sample of
body sway is taken: A video camera
mounted about 1 meter overhead focuses on a 1.6-cm round paper cutout
which has previously been pasted on top
of the head. The subject is then instructed to continue standing still and
close the eyes while a second 30-second
videotaped sample is taken. At a convenient later time, eyes-open and eyesclosed body sway is estimated by playing
the tape on a video monitor, drawing
the movement of the paper spot on the
monitor screen with a crayon, and then
measuring the maximum fore and aft excursion and the maximum lateral excursion made during the time sample.
These excursions are then summed, and
the sum 1s corrected for focal length (focal length varies as a function of the

height of the subject, as the video camera is mounted from the ceiling and is
fixed in place) for eyes-open and eyesclosed body sway measurements.

3. Hand steadiness is assessed by asking the subject to hold a thin (1.5-mm)
metal probe within a small (4-mm) hole
ina metal plate without letting the probe
touch the sides of the hole. The subject
is seated for this test and is not allowed
to brace his/her hand, arm, or wrist on
the table or with the other hand. Two
10-second trials are given. The score is
the amount of time the probe is not in
contact with the plate during the 20second test.

4, Memory for sequence is measured
using Milton Bradley’s “Simon” game
apparatus. The subject repeats the increasingly longer light/tone sequences
programmed on the machine until an error is made. The score is then the number of correct sequential choices made
on the previous (correct) trial.

5. Tracking skill is assessed via use of
a Lafayette Instrument Company pursuit rotor set at 45 rpm. The target is a 2cm metal disc, with its center offset 8 cm
from the center of rotation. Time on target is measured during a 30-second time
sample.

6. Visual acuity is measured by means
of American Optical eye charts with a
visual angle of 1 minute. Vision is assessed with both eyes together and with
use of corrective lenses, if the subject
wears these.

7. Six paper-and-pencil tests are
given: (1) The Colorado Perceptual
Speed Test (30 seconds; 18 items) has
items consisting of a four-letter/number
stimulus (e.g., pbqd) followed by four
choices. Among the choices, one is exactly the same as the stimulus, while the
other three are reordered. The task is to

 

Social Biology

circle the choice exactly like the stimulus
and move on to the next item. Scores are
total number correct and total number
of errors of commission. (2) The Cancellation Test (60 seconds) has 280 dot sets.
A dot set may include three, four, or five
dots. The task is to ignore three-dot sets,
place a horizontal line through four-dot
sets, and place a vertical line through
five-dot sets. Scores are number correct
and total errors of commission. (3) The
Sentence Checking Test (30 seconds; 24
items) has items which have as a stimulus a simple logical phrase (e.g., “A not
after B’’). The task is to circle the correct answer from two choices (e.g., AB
BA). Scores are number correct and total errors of commission. (4) The ETS
Card Rotations Test (60 seconds; 7 rows
of 8 figures) has a line drawing of a relatively simple geometric figure which
serves as a stimulus for each row. The
row is then filled out with a random mix
of the same figure in a rotated position
or in a mirror-image rotated position.
The task is to circle all figures which are
only rotated and to avoid all mirror images. Scores are number correct and total errors of commission. (5) The Reaction Time—Written Test (30 seconds;
100 rows) has rows of blocks of four letters (e.g., NZL A). Given a target letter as a Starting instruction, the task is to
circle the target letter in each block,
working from top to bottom. Scores are
number correct and total errors of commission. (6) The Shepard-Metzler Mental Rotations (Block Rotations) Test as
modified by Vandenberg (Vandenberg
and Kuse, 1978) is a fairly difficult 20item test of spatial ability. Each item
consists of a stimulus, which is a twodimensional representation of threedimensional array of cubes, followed by
two correct alternatives and two incorDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 32, No. 3-4

rect ones. We use a shortened version of
the test (60 seconds; 8 items), and only
two choices are presented for each item;
the correct choice shows the stimulus array in a rotated position, while the other
(incorrect) shows a slightly different array. Scores are number correct and total
errors of commission.

8. A reaction-time apparatus is employed, modeled after the apparatus described by Jensen and Munro (1979).
First, 10 trials of simple reaction time
are given. For each trial, the seated subject is instructed to hold his/her finger on
a button until a single light (18 cm away)
comes on. As quickly as possible he/she
is then to release the first button (reaction time), and press the button next to
the light (movement time). Next, the
stimulus board is replaced with one
which contains a “home” button plus
four lights arranged in an arc about 18
cm from the home button. Using a programmed pseudo-random sequence,
any one of the four lights can be
switched on. Again, scores on 10 trials
include reaction time and movement
time. Lastly, the stimulus board js replaced with one containing eight lights.
Scoring on 10 trials is the same as above.
Working from information theory, Jensen has defined the one-light board as
having zero bits of information, while
the four-light board has two bits, and the
eight-light board has three bits. Following Hick’s paradigm as described by Jensen and Munro (1974), increasing task
complexity (number of bits) results in an
increased reaction time for most subjects; from a plot of reaction time by
complexity, the slope or rate of change
can be obtained.

9, Rail Walking. Using a5-cm X 5-cm
square metal tube 245 cm long bolted to
the floor, each subject is given pre-test

Individual Differences and Alcohol

169

trials to determine a mode of administration which is about the right level of
difficulty. First, he/she is instructed to
walk forward on the rail, touching heel
to toe on each step and avoiding touching a foot to the floor for balance. If this
is too easy (full length traversed successfully), the subject is asked to try again,
walking backward. If this is too easy, the
subject is asked to try the test walking
forward but with eyes closed. If still too
easy, the subject is asked to take the test
walking backward with eyes closed.
Once an appropriate mode is chosen
(only about one-half the length can be
traversed successfully), this becomes
that subject’s test mode for the rest of
the day. The score consists of the number of steps taken before losing balance.
Two trials are given during each test session, and scores are summed to yield the
total score.

10. Dowel Balance. The seated subject is asked to balance a round wooden
dowel on the palm of his/her preterred
hand for up to 30 seconds, without letting the dowel fall or touch the body or
any object and without getting up from
the chair. During pre-testing, a suitable
dowel is chosen from among an array,
such that the subject can, with difficulty
and concentration, balance the dowel
for only about 15 seconds before it falls.
This dowel is then used for all test sessions for that subject. In general, the
shorter, thinner dowels are more difficult, while the heavier, longer dowels
are easier. The score consists of the
number of seconds the dowel was balanced. Two trials are given in every test
session, and scores are summed to yield
the total score.

Corporation video game ‘Space Armada” on an Intellivision microcompu

ter, the subject is asked to achieve the
maximum score he/she can within a 3minute playing period. A slightly modified scoring procedure is used. The
subject earns one point for each “‘alien”’
shot down on the first screen presentation. If the screen is cleared of all aliens,
two points are earned for each hit on
Screen two, and three points per hit on
screen three.

12. Twenty-four items from The
Profile of Mood States (POMS) Test
(McNair et al., 1971) are employed to
assess mood. Our interest in the relationship between subjective perceptions
of alcohol sensitivity and objective assessments of sensitivity (Gabrielli and
Plomin, 1985) led us to include seven
self-report questions relating to other
possible effects of alcohol (flushing, dizziness, nausea, sleepy, uncoordinated,
balance impaired, driving impaired).
The tester also rates each subject in
terms of the same items plus talkativeness. These two questionnaires are
given to each subject as the last task
within a test session.

CorTICAL EVOKED REsponsEs (CER)

On three occasions throughout the
day, measurements are made of the cortical response evoked by an auditory
stimulus (click), including the amount of
cortical suppression that is achieved after repeated presentation of the click.
Recordings from the vertex are monitored on an oscilloscope and recorded
on an FM tape recorder for later power
spectral analysis. CER is measured once
prior to alcohol administration, between the Pre-2 and the Pre-3 test sessions; once during the 0.100 g/dl BAC
period, between the Post-1 and Post-2
test sessions; and once just before the
final test session (Post-4), when BAC

has declined to about one-half the peak
value.

An analyses are not yet complete for
the Jensen apparatus, the POMS, the
subjective ratings of impairment, or the
cortical evoked responses, results from
these tests are not reported at this time.

(usually a decrement) could be seen as
per cent change. For statistical assessments, we used the actual scores. For
each test, sensitivity to alcohol was assessed by paired t-tests between each
Post-1 score and the relevant base score;
tolerance (Acute Behavioral Tolerance
to Ethanol, ABTE) was assessed by using paired t-tests to compare Post-3
scores with Post-1 scores. Other analytical procedures are outlined in the
Results section.

Our 5-year testing goal for behavioral
genetic analyses is 450 subjects. We are
now in Year 2 of this study and 150 individuals have been tested. Data from 78
of these have been coded, checked, and
entered into computer files. When we
examined the breath alcohol (BrAC)
data from these 78 subjects, we noted
that 10 had BrAC’s lower than 0.073 g/
di and 9 had BrAC’s higher than 0.109 g/
di averaged over the 18 BrAC measurements taken during the 3 hours when we
attempted to maintain BrAC at 0.100 g/
dl. This range represents + 20 per cent
of the overall mean BrAC obtained for
the sample (0.091). Though these readings may be due to machine error (it is
unlikely that our dosing procedure
could have allowed this much variability), we decided that the conservative
thing to do was to exclude these subjects
from the analyses. Six others were excluded because they became sick (in
most cases, vomited) sometime during
the testing day, so their data sets were
incomplete. For the remaining 53, the
data are relatively complete, except for
an occasional apparatus malfunction.

scores), critical for the interpretation of
individual differences data, are presented in Table 1. Although the interval
between the test and retest was only
about 40 minutes, these estimates of reliability are more conservative than the
usual internal consistency estimates.
The tests are reasonably reliable (the
median correlation to 0.82), except for
Simon and Body Sway—Eyes Open.
The estimates for Block Rotations and
for Card Rotations are rather low as
well. The measurement unreliability of
the Simon apparatus seems to be a result
of the randomization routine which it incorporates as, with only four lights, the
probability of a string with a same-light
sequence (e.g., red red red red) is rather
high, and occurrence of one of these
same-light strings can make a trial far
too easy. For Body Sway, Block Rotations, and Card Rotations, there may be
differential practice effects which lead
to lowered reliability, although, as discussed later, this hypothesis does not

seem to be supported by our other analyses. On the whole, though, the battery
seems to measure a broad array of functions rather accurately.

BREATH ALCOHOL ASSESSMENTS

As shown in Figure 1, the mean
breath alcohol (BrAC) estimates of
blood alcohol concentration are about
0.090 g/dl across the first three alcohol
test sessions (Post-1 to Post-3), rather
than 0.100 g/dl, as intended. However,
the use of “topping up” doses appears to
have been successful, in that the BrAC
curve is quite flat across these 3 hours.
The BrAC at Post-4 is, of course, about
one-half the value for the other alcohol
test sessions, as the Post-4 test session
was started for each subject when his/

her BrAC had decreased to one-half the
peak value seen after the initial alcohol
dose. Individual differences in BrAC
were substantial and are taken into account in later analyses.

AVERAGE SENSITIVITY

Figures 2-5 contain mean change
scores (for total correct responses) on
the various measures. For each subject,
a change score was computed by dividing each Post-1 through Post-4 test score
by the subject’s pre-alcohol base score
and multiplying by 100 to yield per cent
change. The tests included in each figure
are grouped for clarity of presentation,
rather than by test order. The two body

these functions indicate a decrement in
performance. Although it is not clear
what represents a performance decrement for some of the physiological measures (e.g., blood pressure), for convenience these were plotted alongside the
behavioral measures for which mean decrements are expected.

For many of the change functions in
Figures 2-5, there is apparently an average deterioration or decrement in per
 

formance immediately after the initial
alcohol dose. Such decrements (or, at
least, changes) are here used as measures of sensitivity to ethanol. Specifically, mean sensitivity was assessed
statistically for each test or function via a
paired t-test between the mean base
score and the mean Post-1 score (twotailed test). These means, f-values, and
p-values are shown in the left half of Table 2, For all measures except heart rate

significantly from base scores. Body
temperature decreased, blood pressure
increased, and most of the behavioral
measures showed performance decrements; two measures, Cancellation and
Block Rotations, showed significant tmprovement. The greatest decrements in
performance at Post-1 emerged for
Dowel Balance (33 per cent decrement), the body sway measures (28 per
cent decrement for eyes-open and 37
per cent decrement for eyes-closed),
Perceptual Speed (26 per cent decrement), and Rail Walking (24 per cent

the greatest mean effects of alcohol as
measured during the initial sensitivity
period involve gross motor functioning
(body sway and rail walking) or eyehand coordination (dowel balance and
perceptual speed).

AVERAGE ACUTE TOLERANCE

Figures 2-5 also indicate that, on the
average, acute tolerance occurs for several measures. For example, three of the
measures that show the greatest sensitivity (Dowel Balance, Perceptual

Speed, and Rail Walking) at Post-1
show improved performance at Post-3.
The body sway measures are an exception, however. For an assessment of
mean acute behavioral tolerance
(ABTE), scores obtained during the
Post-3 testing session were contrasted to
those from the Post-1 session by using
paired f-tests. The relevant means, f
 

values, and p-values are shown in the
right half of Table 2. It can be seen that,
of the 15 measures that showed significant decrements at Post-1, 7 showed
significant improvement from Post-1 to
Post-3, which is our operational definition of acute tolerance.

Although these analyses focus on the
three test sessions when BrAC was
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

Vol. 32, No. 3-4

maintained near 0.100 g/dl, it should be
noted in Figures 2-5 that Post-4
scores—when BrAC had been reduced
by metabolism to one-half the peak
value for each subject—also provide
support for ABTE. For most measures,
Post-4 performance was at or even exceeded base performance, even though
BrAC was nearly 0.050 g/dl.

It is interesting that the body sway
measures are an exception to the general finding of ABTE because some version of this test is often used as a screening device by police. One complexity of
interpretation as to tolerance effects is
that practice effects and tolerance effects lead to improved performance
while fatigue and boredom could lead to
decrements in performance, and we do
not yet know in detail how these factors
interact. However, on the basis of placebo control data from our study in Hawali, we can at least say that Body
Sway—Eyes Closed showed no changes
over 4 hours of testing in that study.
Moreover, in the present study, no
significant change in performance on the
two body sway measures was observed
from Pre-2 to Pre-3, again providing no
evidence for the hypothesis of practice
effects.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES

Both during testing and during the
subsequent data analyses, it was evident
that individual differences in responses
were large, both for sensitivity and for
acute tolerance. In Figure 6, we present
the actual distribution of scores of the 53
subjects for two measures which showed
large average sensitivity effects, Body
Sway—Eyes Closed and Hand Steadiness. Some individuals show no decrement in performance after alcohol dosage; some show impairment; and a few
(e.g., Subjects 21, 31, and 46 for the

Individual Differences and Alcohol

 

177

body sway measure and Subjects 29 and
41 for hand steadiness) actually improve
at Post-1. Similarly, as expected from
the means analyses, some individuals
show ABTE during the Post-3 testing as
compared to their Post-1 scores; some
show no change; and a few intolerant individuals show performance decrements
(e.g., Subject 41 for measures of both
body sway and hand steadiness).

In an attempt to understand the
sources of the individual differences in
Post-3 performance, we conducted a hierarchical multiple regression analysis
for each measure. At step one, the regressions of Post-3 scores on sex, age,
height, and weight were estimated; at
step two, the effects of drinking history
(as a measure of already developed tolerance to alcohol) were obtained; at
step three, the Pre-2 scores were used te
estimate the effects of pre-existing individual differences on Post-3 performance on the various tasks; at step four,
the Pre-3 scores were used in an attempt
to ascertain whether any additional preexisting individual differences in Post-3
performance can be predicted by Pre-3
scores after the variance due to Pre-2
scores is removed; at step five, the
BrAC variation during Post-3 was used
as a correlate in order to estimate the effects of the + 20 per cent variation in
BrAC readings to which this data set
had been constrained (dosing error).

These estimates, together with an estimate of test unreliability obtained by
subtracting test reliability from 1.0, are
shown in Table 3. The medians reported
in the last row are particularly informative: About 85 per cent of the total variance in the 19 measures can be explained. The median variance accounted for by the various effects is 11 per
cent by gender, age, weight, and height

tiple regression); 2 per cent by drinking
history (step two); 35 per cent by preexisting individual differences in performance (steps three and four); and 1
per cent by dosing error (step five). Unreliability of measurement accounted
for 18 per cent of the variance.

The variance accounted for by gender (4 per cent on the average) should
not be interpreted as differences between males and females in their responses to alcohol. As emphasized
later, the major influence on Post-3
scores is base performance; the variance
explained by gender is primarily due to
performance differences unrelated to alcohol. Few gender differences in sensitivity or tolerance were observed.

The effects of previous drinking history on Post-3 scores seem surprisingly
small given the emphasis in the literature on chronic tolerance. It may be that
tolerance effects in our rather young
sample are indeed small. However, it
must be remembered that those who reported alcohol-related problems in their
lives had been screened out for ethical
reasons. Thus, heavier drinkers who
probably show more tolerance may be
underrepresented.

these observations of individual differences in the face of average effects, we
estimated the degree of overlap between the base score distribution and
the Post-3 distribution by use of the d
statistic and associated tables as described by Cohen (1977, p. 49). These
effect size estimates are presented for

near 0.100 g/dl) outperformed about
one-third of the base score distribution.

Conversions of the d statistic to a
point-biserial correlation provides an index of effect size (Cohen, 1977). Following Cohen’s procedures, the percentage
of variance in the Post-3 scores accounted for by alcohol is 5 per cent on
the average across the measures. In contrast, pre-existing individual differences
account for about 35 per cent of the variance. Although the alcohol effect size
accounts for more variance for Post-1
and Post-2 scores, performance after 3
hours of drinking is interesting conceptually because so few studies have adDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

dressed the issue of acute tolerance. It
might also be more important societally
because the typical soctal drinking occasion lasts for several hours; performance
after 3 hours’ consumption must surely
be more applicable to performance outside the laboratory than is performance
measured immediately following the
consumption of four or five drinks in a
15-minute period.

DISCUSSION

The major message from these
results is that variability among individuals in their responses to alcohol is far
greater than any average effect. Three
possible problems in our study—dosing
inaccuracies, possible practice effects,
and improvement in certain scores following consumption of alcohol—affect
only analyses of means and thus do not
alter this basic conclusion. Nonetheless,
we Shall examine these issues in greater
detail.

DosInG INACCURACIES

With the intent of raising the blood
alcohol concentration to 0.100 g/dl, we
calculated the initial ethanol dose on the
basis of 0.8 g/kg body weight. This may
seem to imply an assumption that the
Widmark r for each person was equal to
0.8. Since the average ‘Widmark r is
about 0.65 or 0.7, the use of a 0.8 g/kg
dose would seem to be too high. Yet,
this dose works in practice, probably because some metabolic clearance of the
ethanol is achieved during the absorption phase. The individual differences in
the Widmark r and, probably, in speed
of absorption represent a stickier problem, as they lead to BACs different
from 0.100 g/dl. To achieve a relatively
homogeneous data set for the present

Wilson and Plomin

Social Biology

analyses, we excluded data from subjects whose BAC estimates differed by
more than 20 per cent from the mean
BrAC measure (0.091 g/dl). The temporary loss of these data seems mandated
by the logic underlying the analyses reported above, as we had not undertaken
to manipulate BAC levels beyond the
0.0 (pre-alcohol) to 0.100 g/dl comparison. The remaining variation in BrAC
readings was used as a covariate (dosing ~
error) in the multiple regression analyses and accounted for only 1 per cent of
Post-3 performance variance. The mean
BrAC measure may be accurate, or,
more likely, may be an underestimate,
as the Intoxilyzer machine has been reported to yield readings which are about
0.005 g/dl too low (O’Neill et al., 1983). .
Despite these procedural difficulties,
subjects were, on the average, maintained at about the same BAC across
the 3 hours of alcohol testing, as is required to assess ABTE.

PRACTICE EFFECTS

We first considered average effects of
alcohol—sensitivity immediately following alcohol consumption (measured
by the difference between base performance and Post-1 scores) and acute tolerance or ABTE (measured by the difference between Post-3 scores and Post-1
scores). Interpretation of mean effects is
aided by knowledge concerning practice
effects, fatigue, and expectancy which
can be obtained by testing placebo control subjects. We are currently collecting data for placebo control individuals
by floating a small amount (about 3-4
ml) of ethanol on top of their cocktail.
Although our current sample of contro]
subjects is not yet large enough for analysis, Our previous study in Hawaii
(Wilson et al., 1984) showed relatively
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 32, No. 3-4

flat performance curves for control subjects on similar measures, thus suggesting that the combined effects of practice
and fatigue were balanced reasonably
well by our procedure. The present data
can be used to provide some information relevant to practice effects by comparing scores for Pre-2 and Pre-3, the
pre-alcohol performance trials which
were averaged to construct our index of
base performance. For 14 of the 19 comparisons, no differences were observed
between Pre-2 and Pre-3 scores, suggesting that practice effects are unlikely
to interfere with our analyses of average
sensitivity and acute tolerance.

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AFTER
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

Broadly speaking, sensitivity may be
defined as any significant change in performance after administration of alcohol (or any drug). In this sense, all tests
save one reveal significant mean changes
indicating sensitivity. Even the exception, visual acuity, shows a trend for a
performance change. It is probably
more common to restrict the use of
pharmacological term, “sensitivity” to
alcohol, to those instances in which a
significant behavioral decrement is
found. In this sense also, most of the
tests in the battery reveal mean sensitivity effects, i.e., mean behavioral decrements during the Post-1 testing session.
The exceptions include the blood pressure measurements, Cancellation, and
Block Rotations. The rise in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure may
also represent a decrement in function,
so these may not be exceptions. The rise
in the mean scores on Cancellation and
Block Rotations might represent a practice effect, an exuberance effect, or
both. In the Hawaiian study, Cancel

lation was used and showed no change
for placebo control subjects. However,
in that study, Cancellation showed only
a return to base performance an hour after consumption of alcohol, not the 10 to
20 per cent improvement beyond base
performance as seen in the present
study. Also, Cancellation is a test of perceptual speed and our other measures of
perceptual speed show the more typical
pattern of mean decrements. Furthermore, Cancellation was one of the few
tests that showed a practice effect from
Pre-2 to Pre-3; thus, for now, we assume
that the improved performance on the
Cancellation test under the influence of
alcohol is a practice effect.

An interesting possibility emerges
concerning Block Rotations, which is a
measure of spatial ability. No suggestion
of practice effects emerged either in the
Hawaiian study or in the present comparisons between Pre-2 and Pre-3
scores. We suggest that the rise in the
Block Rotations scores following consumption of alcohol might represent a
switch in cortical function to the (usually) subordinate right hemisphere, as a
function of alcohol suppression of the
left hemisphere. This latter possibility
was posed before on the basis of results
of our Hawaiian study (e.g., Wilson et
al., 1984). In that study, another spatial
test, Card Rotations, showed significantly higher scores for the alcohol
subjects than for the placebo control
subjects. Although we are not yet able
to report results for control subjects, the
present results for Card Rotations are
similar in that the Post-2 average score is
about 10 per cent above base performance and the Post-3 mean is the same as
the base performance. We incorporated
the more difficult Block Rotations test
of spatial ability into the present study in

order to explore this finding further, and
the results to date appear promising.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES

The most striking aspect of the data is
the importance of individual differences, as shown in Figure 6. Most notably, a few people performed as well after
alcohol dosage as they had during baseline testing. It should be noted that our
results are in accord with those of many
other studies in showing statistically
significant average effects of alcohol;
however, the alcohol effect does not explain much variance. That is, individual
differences in response to alcohol outweigh the average effect of alcohol.
Many studies do not report data needed
to estimate precisely the extent to which
the average effect of alcohol accounts
for individual differences in performance, although our rough estimates are
that these other data generally agree
with our conclusions about the importance of individual differences. Consider, for example, a recent report on
the effects of alcohol (Mills and Bixgrove, 1983). As in nearly all such studies, a single dose was administered to assess the effects of alcohol. The measure
used was a vigilance/reaction time task
which was presented at 20, 40, 60, and
80 minutes after alcohol consumption.
Only a high alcohol dose (0.80 g/kg) had
a Significant mean effect. As is typical in
such studies, no mention was made of
individual differences in response to alcohol. In fact, the main presentation of
data does not indicate whether the variability bars refer to standard errors or
standard deviations. However, we can
deduce from the results that the bars refer to plus and minus one standard error
of the mean. The results suggest a difference of about one standard deviation

Wilson and Plomin

between the pre-alcohol mean and the
post-alcohol mean. These results suggest that only about 20 per cent of the
variance in performance under a high
dose of alcohol is explained by the effect
of alcohol. In other words, there is 55
per cent overlap in the no-alcohol distribution and the 0.80 g/kg distribution,
which means that individuals in the top
16 per cent of the alcohol distribution
outperformed half of the distribution
under the no-alcohol condition.

Taken as a whole, our results suggest
that an individual’s response to alcohol
is but poorly predicted by the average effects so often reported (and used by police and courts). Some individuals perform as well at 0.100 g/dl BAC as they
do at 0.0. Further, many individuals at
0.100 g/dl BAC outperform many others who are at 0.0. :

Even though we did not directly test
the effects of alcohol on driving, we
would be remiss if we did not attempt to
discuss these results with respect to driving and to drunk-driving laws, as it
seems obvious that many of the functions tested are pertinent to driving
skills. The results showing mean performance decrements after the initial
dose of alcohol are consonant with a
large literature. What seems to have
been overlooked, however, is that these
are mean decrements. Individual differences after alcohol dosage are large and
pervasive. For some individuals, the
mean is a very poor predictor of performance.

Another aspect which seems to have
been overlooked is the rapid development of functional tolerance. Judging
even from the mean effect, most individuals perform better when their BAC has
been high for a period of hours, compared to the immediate effects of alco

hol, and, again, some persons show this
ABTE phenomenon to a large degree.
Existing laws seem to disregard this possibility entirely. .

Do these data imply that blood or
breath alcohol levels should not be used
in drunk-driving laws? The answer
could be “no.” Although BAC does not
adequately measure an individual’s performance under the influence of alcohol, research certainly suggests that
some individuals are at increased risk for
traffic accidents at 0.100 g/dl BAC. Itisa
truism that there would be no drunk
drivers if no one drove with a BAC
above 0.0 g/dl. Thus, laws that prohibit
driving with high blood alcohol levels
could keep drunk drivers off the road,
even though many unimpaired individuals would also be prohibited from driv
ing after drinking.

Pointing out that the relationship between BAC and intoxication is weak
creates some legislative and judicial
problems. Let us be clear: We do not
condone drunk driving. In fact, freed
from the constraint of using BAC to

Individual Differences and Alcohol 183

measure driving impairment, one could
argue that current BAC limits should be
lowered in order to reduce even further
the likelihood of drunk driving by a few
individuals such as teenagers who may
be particularly sensitive to the effects of
alcohol. Our research and past research
by others indicate that a BAC in the vicinity of 0.100 g/dl is a poor predictor of
performance of individuals. Attempts to
assess individuals’ possible impairment
following consumption of alcohol
should go beyond BAC to include statements by eye witnesses, physical evidence of driving ability, and some of the
old fashioned roadside behavioral tests.
It seems illogical and unfair to treat individuals by law on the basis of a mean
population response.
