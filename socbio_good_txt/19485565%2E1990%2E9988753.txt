© ABSTRACT: A number of studies have shown that mean intelligence levels have been increasing
+ ata rate of around 3 IQ points per decade during the last half-century. This paper presents data
© for cohorts of 9-11 year olds in Northern Ireland tested in 1978 and 1988 and shows that the
5 rates of increase differ markedly for different primary abilities. Verbal comprehension has
© shown virtually no increase, while there have been large increases in spatial relations and
5 perceptual speed. Moderate increases have taken place in the numerical and reasoning
S primaries. The results are interpreted as supporting a nutrition theory of the secular increases in

o intelligence.

In the last few years there have been
"ga number of reports showing that mean
levels of intelligence have increased sub"2 stantially in the economically developed
a nations over the course of the last half¢ century. Studies have reported in“3 creases in the United States (Flynn,
© 1984), Japan and Britain (Lynn and
‘= Hampson, 1986; Lynn et al., 1987; Lynn
et al., 1988), in several countries of Con© tinental Europe, and in Australia, New
-8 Zealand and Canada (Flynn, 1987).

6 Most of these studies have reported

8 secular increases for a single IQ. How& ever, when the data are examined, there
is some indication that the nonverbal
abilities have increased more than the
verbal abilities. When the Wechsler
tests are used, the performance IQ has
shown a greater increase than the verbal
IQ in the United States and several
other countries (Flynn, 1987). In Britain
we have found that the verbal Scottish
test used in the 1932 and 1947 surveys
has shown an increase of only 1.1 IQ
points per decade over the period 193286 (Lynn et al., 1988) as compared with

137

an increase of 2.5 IQ points per decade
obtained with the Cattell nonverbal test
over approximately the same period
(Lynn, Hampson and Mullineux, 1987).

The reasons for these secular increases in intelligence are not yet understood. Some light may be thrown on this
problem by the apparent tendency of
the nonverbal abilities to show greater
increases than the verbal. There are two
most probable explanations for the secular increases in intelligence. The first is
that they are due to improvements in
cognitive stimulation arising from the
greater availability of toys, radio and
TV, and improvements in education, as
proposed by Teasdale and Owen
(1987).

By this theory, greater increases
would be expected in the verbal abilities
than in the nonverbal abilities, because
the verbal abilities are generally considered to be more responsive to cognitive
stimulation. Thus, there are greater socioeconomic status differences in the
verbal then in the nonverbal abilities in
the United States (Jensen and Rey

nolds, 1982), Britain (Nisbet and
Entwhistle, 1967), and France (Dumaret, 1985). The most probable explanation for the greater socioeconomic
status differences in the verbal abilities
is that these are to some extent taught in
families, more so than the nonverbal
abilities. Middle class families tend to be
more effective in teaching the abilities
and hence raise the verbal abilities more
than the nonverbal abilities.

For this reason, an improved cognitive stimulation theory of the secular increases in intelligence would lead to the
expectation that the verbal abilities
would have shown greater increases
than the nonverbal. Yet, as noted, the
existing evidence suggests the contrary
and therefore presents a difficulty for
the theory.

The second possible theory of the intelligence increases is that they may be
due to improvements in nutrition. There
have certainly been improvements in
nutrition over the course of the last halfcentury which are apparent from the
secular increases that have taken place
in a number of economically developed
nations in height (Brandt, 1978). These
improvements in nutrition have also led
to increases in brain size (Ounsted et al.,
1985; Davies et al., 1985) and possibly
also to enhanced neurological development of the brain, e.g., in the growth of
dendrites, glial cells, and myelination of
the neurons. It is possible that neurological improvements of these kinds could
be the principal factor responsible for
the secular increases in intelligence.

There is some evidence that suboptimal nutrition has greater adverse effects
on the nonverbal abilities than on the
verbal. There have been two studies in
which identical twins with differing birth
weights, brought about by insufficient
nutrition from the placenta to one twin,

Lynn

Social Biology

have been given the Wechsler Test at
the age of around 10 years. In both cases
the lighter twin at birth was impaired on
the performance (nonverbal) IQ, but
there was no difference on the verbal JO
(Willerman and Churchill, 1937; Hendrichsen et al., 1986). These results suggest that the suboptimal nutrition of the
lighter twin had adverse effects only on
the nonverbal abilities. If this is true,
secular improvements in nutrition
would be expected to lead to greater increases in the nonverbal abilities. The
existing data provide some suggestive
evidence that this is the case, as noted
above, and therefore tend to favor a nutritional improvement theory of the secular rise of intelligence.

In this paper, further data on rates of
secular increase are reported for five
major primary abilities and the implications of the results considered for theories of the factors responsible for the increases.

MATRIALS AND METHODS

The Primary Mental Abilities Test
(Thurstone, 1963) measures and provides separate IQ’s for the verbal comprehension, numerical ability, spatial
relations, reasoning, and perceptual
speed primary abilities. In 1978 this test
was administered to all the fifth- and
sixth-grade children (9-11 year olds) in
four schools in a small town in Northern
Ireland. In 1988 the test was administered to the children in the same grades
in the same schools. It is therefore possible to determine the changes in mean
IQ’s for the five abilities separately.

RESULTS

two grades and their mean ages in

Wistribution of the subjects are closely
similar for the two years. The intelli‘Pence test results are shown in Table 2.
t will be seen that there are striking differences in the rates of secular increase
of the five abilities. Verbal comprehension has shown virtually no increase at
all, whereas there are large increases of
6.18 and 8.88 IQ points respectively in
the spatial relations and perceptual
speed abilities. The numerical and reasoning abilities show intermediate rates
of increase. If the five abilities are averaged, there was a mean IQ of 103.30 in
1978 and of 107.14 in 1988, giving an increase of 3.84 IQ points. This figure is

broadly similar to the results obtained in
previous studies, but it is apparent that
the rise in global IQ conceals substantial
differences in the rates of increases of
the primaries considered separately.

DISCUSSION

The results confirm in sharper focus
the tendencies of previous studies to
show greater secular increases in the
nonverbal abilities than in the verbal.
The principal interest in the data lies in
the bearing of the results for theories of
the secular increases in intelligence. In
the introduction to this paper, reasons
were set out for expecting that an improved cognitive stimulation theory

140

would predict greater increases in the
verbal abilities than in the nonverbal.
Yet the results show no significant increase in verbal ability and a relatively
small increase in numerical ability which
is directly taught in schools and to some
degree informally in families through
such things as dice and card games. The
really large increases are in the spatial
relations and perceptual speed abilities
which are very little taught either in
schools or in families.

It is proposed that these differential
rates of increase count against a cognitive stimulation theory of the rises in
IQ’s and favor a nutrition theory. As
noted in the introduction, suboptimal
nutrition appears to impair the performance IQ of the Wechsler but not the
verbal IQ. The Wechsler performance
IQ contains tests of spatial relations (the
block design and object assembly tests)
and also of perceptual speed (coding),
so the larger rises of spatial relations and
perceptual speed abilities may be attributable to secular improvements in nutrition. Possibly the causal sequence may
be that improvements in nutrition have
brought about larger head size and
larger brains and that these in turn have
contributed to improved intelligence.
The head size of children has increased
by approximately one standard deviation over the last half-century (Ounsted
et al., 1985; Davies et al., 1985), and
head size is correlated with IQ at a magnitude of approximately 0.3 (Van Valen, 1974). Alternatively, it may be that
secular improvements in nutrition have
generated enhanced neurological development of the brain, e.g., in the growth
of dendrites and glial cells, and that this
has led to the improvement of intelligence. The secular increase in head size
could be just a further correlated effect
of the improvements in nutrition.

Lynn

Social Biology

There are three other points of interest in the results. First, many of the
results on the secular rise of intelligence
cover long time spans from pre-World
War Two to a recent date, e.g., 1932-86
(Lynn et al., 1988). The present results
show that intelligence is still rising over a
recent decade at the same rate of increase. There is apparently as yet no diminishing returns effect.

Second, Flynn (1987) has expressed
doubts as to whether the rise in IQ can
reflect genuine rises in cognitive ability
and argues that if increases in cognitive
ability of one standard deviation over
the last half-century had taken place
people would have noticed it. The differential rates of increase suggest a solution to this problem. Probably we judge
people’ intelligence largely from their
verbal ability and rather little from their
spatial or perceptual speed abilities. As
the verbal abilities have shown very little secular increase, we are not particuJarly struck by the rises that have taken
place.

Third, it is commonly supposed that
the nonverbal abilities decline with aging more than do the verbal abilities
(e.g., Horn, 1988). Insofar as this conclusion is based on cross-sectional studies, a considerable element in this apparent effect is probably that the
nonverbal abilities have shown greater
secular increases than the verbal. Thus,
the relatively poor nonverbal abilities of
older people may well be largely due to
the fact that the older generations never
had strong nonverbal abilities, not to a
decline in these abilities with aging.
