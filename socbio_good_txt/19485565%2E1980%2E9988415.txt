ABSTRACT: Causal models of the effects of maternal age on offspring intelligence were generated
using three large data sets. The direct and indirect effects of two components of maternal age,
teenage motherhood and linear maternal age, were investigated separately for white and black
children. The intervening variables investigated as routes of indirect effect were family structure,
parental education, parental employment, family income, and family size. The findings indicate
that there are no direct effects of teenage maternity on offspring intelligence, and that the observed
negative relationship is primarily attributable to parental education. In contrast, the overall effect
of maternal age, while very small and positive, is primarily direct, that is, not mediated by any of
the social or economic conditions included in the model. The consistency of these findings and the
impact on children’s intelligence of the other variables included in the model are demonstrated and

discussed.

It is often thought that young motherhood has negative consequences not only
for the social and economic attainment of
the mother but also for the offspring.
Perhaps this belief has arisen in part from
the observation that neighborhoods and
public schools representing populations in
which very young motherhood is common
often show poor achievement levels and
excess behavioral problems. Nevertheless
there are relatively few systematic studies
of the relationship between age of mother
and child characteristics.

Two reasons may account for this relative paucity. First, data on the status and
functional level of children is most reliably
gathered after they have attained school
age, by which time the youth of the

mother may be less obvious. Second, the
effects of birth order and the presumed effects of young motherhood work in opposite directions. Since children of older
mothers are more likely to be of higher
birth orders than are children of younger
mothers, an examination of maternal age
without consideration of birth order may
fail to reveal effects.

In an unusually thorough investigation
of maternal age and birth order, Record et
al. (1969) examined verbal reasoning
scores at age 11 of 48,913 single births
born in Birmingham, Great Britain, in
1950-54. The scores have a population
mean of 100 and a standard deviation of
15; thus they are comparable to IQ scores.
Within birth order groups there was an increase of approximately 0.4 to 0.5 points
for each year of maternal age, and this effect was consistent across all birthorder—maternal-age combinations for

which there were sufficient data for relliable estimates. The birth order effect was
approximately 2.5 points decrease for
each increase in birth order within maternal age groups. Recognizing the partial
redundancy of maternal age and birth order with social class, the authors divided
the sample into three social class groups.
Although the apparent relationships were
not much diminished, the authors recognized the considerable social class hetero
geneity remaining within the classification

and conservatively stated that ‘“‘the evidence is . . . consistent with the conclusion that the relationship ... reflects
largely the association of (maternal age
and birth rank) with social class”’ (p. 67).

A recent study was conducted (Card,
1978) in which Project Talent data collected in 1960 were employed to assess the
affects of teenaged parenthood on the academic aptitude scores of offspring in
Grades 9-12. In this study a small but
statistically significant disadvantage attributable to teenaged parents was found,
net of other factors, amounting to a difference of approximately 3% points.' The
offspring being tested in the Project Talent study, however, were born in the early
1940’s, and one may well question the generalization of these findings to more recent cohorts. Given the substantial change
in the educational and occupational status
of women and the stability of family structure over the intervening period, it seems
likely that some alteration in this pattern
may be evident.

This paper is the second in a sequence
of studies exploring the psychological consequences for children born to teenage
mothers. The first paper (Belmont et al.,
1981) was concerned, like this one, with

We calculated this point difference by assuming
a standard deviation of 15, as in many common tests
of intelligence, a standard deviation of 0.36 for
adolescent parentage, and the reported B = —0.08

(p. 43).

the intellectual consequences as measured
by intelligence test score. By the use of
three large independently generated data
sources all based on U.S. children, we
showed (1) that children born of teenage
mothers scored lower on the average on
the WISC than did children born of older
mothers, and (2) that this disadvantage to
children of teenage mothers was almost
entirely accounted for by the disadvantageous situation of the mother with respect
to socioeconomic and educational status.
After controlling for demographic variables relating to the parents (education, income, family structure, location) and the
child (age, sex, race, twin status, birth order, number of siblings), there remained a
small relationship between offspring intelligence and mother’s age. Even this extremely slight relation was linear across
the range of maternal age and showed no
particular disadvantage for children of the
teenage woman.

With confidence stemming from the
consistency of results across data sets and
within subpopulations, we interpreted
these findings as demonstrating beyond
reasonable doubt that the offspring of
teenaged mothers suffer virtually no depression in intelligence test score that can
be attributed solely and specifically to the
teenage status of the mothers. To the extent that the scores are depressed, associated social disadvantages—well documented elsewhere and ainply confirmed in
the populations we studied—are likely to
be the major cause.

We turn in this second paper to a more
detailed consideration of these social disadvantages and their relation to intelligence test scores in the offspring. Thus,
we present here empirical estimates of the
extent to which the observed associations
of age of mother with offspring intelligence were mediated by social disadvantages (for instance, maternal education,
family structure, family size, income)

which are themselves in part outcomes of
maternal age at birth. We will be especially concerned with associations affecting the offspring of teenage mothers. In
order to make the estimates, we have set
out in a basic model the likely causal flow
between elements of social disadvantage,
maternal age, and offspring intelligence.
The model, and our reasons for electing it, are described below. The data
sources were reviewed in the first paper
and will be sketched here only briefly. We
note that the papers diverge slightly in the
definition of some of the variables.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE ANALYTIC MODEL

The basic model posits that age of
childbearing has an effect on family structure, parental education, and employment. All of these variables may in turn affect family income and family size, and

finally any or all of the variables may have
an effect on children’s IQ scores.

Causal models are hypothetical representations of the influences of certain variables and conditions on the probabilities
or levels of other variables or conditions.
As such, they are founded on presumed
temporal priority, on mechanisms coherent with previous research findings, or
on commonsense assumptions.

The causal model employed in this
study is represented in Figure 1. The variables to the extreme left—birth order,
singleton or twin, sex, linear maternal
age, and teenage maternity—are the first
tier variables. Birth order is placed in the
first tier in order to allow for the examination of the effects of maternal age within
all birth order groups (for any given birth
order). Previous research (Record et al.,
1969) has demonstrated the value of this
strategy, which has two consequences.
One is that is creates a proxy for age at first
birth, since the ages of women at the time

of births of a given parity appear to be determined in large part by age at the birth of
first children. The second effect is to permit
a finer specification of the family size variable in the third tier. Since birth order
conveys the number of children born prior
to the study child, family size, when simultaneously considered, reflects the number
born after the study child.

These variables and the relationships
among them are the starting point for the
study and no causal explanation is offered
for them.

The set of variables second from the
left; family structure, parental education,
and parental employment are the second
tier variables. These variables are
measured at the time of the survey and
therefore may have been affected by the
temporally prior first tier variables. The
causal impact of teenaged childbearing
and, more generally, age of mother on the
likelihood of current unmarried status is
both plausible and well documented. In
addition to the high risk of out-of-wedlock
status for children of teenaged mothers
(Cutright, 1971), the greater divorce and
separation rates for early marriage are
well known (Bumpass, 1972; Glick and
Norton, 1977). The possible causal impact
of the child characteristics—birth order,
twin, and sex—is more conjectural and of
little interest here. The purpose of these
variables is to control for effects which
might otherwise be inaccurately attributed to the maternal age variables.

The assumption that maternal education is causally dependent on teenaged
childbearing and maternal age, although
common (Jaffe, 1977), is somewhat more
troublesome. The association between
these variables is well known. Three
published studies have attempted to determine the magnitude of the causal effects involved. Although in each case the
population under investigation and the
maternal age variables differed from the

Teenaged Motherhood 141

current study, all three determined that
some or all of the maternal-age—maternal-education association was not
due to an effect of the former on the latter.
Card (1978) removed some of this effect as
spurious and due to the fact that both are
in part influenced by the social class of the
mother’s family of origin. Hofferth and
Moore (1979) essentially agree with this
assessment, although their sample frame,
population, and causal modeling techniques are quite different. Rindfuss et al.
(1980) conclude from their analysis that
most or all of this relationship is attributable to the effect of education on age at
first birth. However, the variables used in
the current study differ from the 1970 National Fertility Study used by Rindfuss et
al. in a number of important ways. First,
the current studies all sample children
rather than mothers, and the maternal age
variable is age at the birth of the study
child, who is not necessarily the first. Second, maternal education is taken at the
time of the examination of the study child
and thus may include education subsequent to childbearing.

None of the data sets examined here
were sufficiently rich in variables which
might have been used as instruments in a
reciprocal causal analysis to allow for a
nonrecursive model. For this reason we
have chosen to estimate the effects of maternal age as if they were determining of
education. However, in a later section of
the paper we recompute the effects employing the estimates provided by the
analyses of other authors. This flexibility
and carry over of causal modeling techniques is, indeed, one ofits most attractive
features.

In explicating the maternal age effect
on childhood IQ we ignore interrelationships among the second tier variables,
concerning ourselves only with causal relationships that flow from the first tier varlables. For this reason the causal model

 

 
 

 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

may be considered an incomplete one; indirect effects operating through variables
in the same tier are omitted. We limit ourselves in this way because reciprocal
causation and unmeasured common
causes are virtually certain to exist among
some or all of the variables within tiers.

The next set of variables—annual family income and family size—are the third
tier variables. All first and second tier varlables are considered as potential causes
of these variables. The logical priority of
second tier variables seem fairly obvious.
Again, interrelations between third tier
variables are ignored.

The final dependent variable is the
child’s IQ. We include all first, second,
and third tier variables as potential
influences on IQ level.

Causal analysis requires that one assume that there are no variables omitted
which have nontrivial and independent effects on both measured cause and effect.
In this study the most probable unmeasured common causes are grandparental social class, which influences
both maternal education and early childbearing (Card, 1978), and mother’s IQ,
which influences age of first childbearing
and maternal education (Hofferth and

oore, 1979). These errors appear on the
face of it to be more likely to affect the validity of our estimates on offspring IQ in
the case of teenaged mothers than of
mothers throughout the age range. Later
in the paper we will estimate the probable
magnitude of the impact of these
specification errors on our model. Two
other sources of common causes of variables in the model are geographic regional
differences and age of the child. These
variables have been employed as controls
in the current analyses but will not be reported on here.

To recapitulate, we expect that there
will be a small direct path from linear maternal age to child’s IQ and no direct path

from teenage maternity. The main purpose of the path model is therefore to
weigh the likely distinctive contributions
of the indirect effects, mediated through
family structure, parental employment
and education, and family size and income, to the observed raw association of
linear maternal age, teenage maternity,
and child’s IQ. Because these estimates
are based on three very large samples we
expect them to have narrow confidence
bands. In the same vein, the high statistical power allows us to be unusually
confident that even very modest sources of
influence can be identified and thus gives
more weight than usual to “null” findings.

DATA SOURCES

The data sources have been fully
described in our first paper (Belmont et
al., 1981). Briefly, three data sets have
been used, the Health Examination Survey (HES) Cycles II and III of the National Center for Health Statistics, and the
Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) of
the National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and Stroke. In
the HES data sets, respondents were randomly selected from a sampling frame designed to provide a representative national sample. The CPP, on the other
hand, gathered data on women attending
prenatal clinics of participating hospitals.
Most of these hospitals were large urban
teaching hospitals. They were predominantly but not exclusively located in the
Northeast section of the country. The
characteristics of the data sources are presented in Table 1, and the definitions of
variables in the data sources are given in
Table 2.

The sample consisted of all children for
whom we had data on the age of mother
obtained from the birth certificate for the
HES samples and age at registration for
prenatal care in the CPP. In addition, the
analyses of the CPP sample were carried

out on the first study child per family in the
case of multiple study children.

MATERNAL AGE

As in our first report, we define Linear
Maternal Age as a continuous variable. In
the present case, we have modified the
definition of teenage childbearing in
defining Teenage Maternity as a dichotomous variable (not trichotomous, as previously defined): mothers under the age of
20 versus those 20 and over. Defining
Teenage Maternity in addition to Linear
Maternal Age within the same estimation
equation permits the effects of the former
to be measured in comparison to the latter. Earlier analyses differentiating between early and late teenaged childbearing produced inconsistent findings.

In Table 3 we present the means or proportions for the variables in each sample.
Note in all three sources the fairly large
differences in education and income for
the black and white samples, especially for
men, and the larger proportion of
teenaged mothers in the black groups.

ANALYTICAL STRATEGY

Maternal ages of childbearing, IQ, and
most of the other variables of interest vary
systematically across regions and com
 

munities. In order to avoid confounding
by these regional differences, the data
were adjusted for region prior to estimation of causal effects. This adjustment
seems appropriate since the maternal age
effects on IQ did not vary from one region
to another.

The causal model does not allow for the
presence of interaction. However, since
only one of the variables used in predicting IQ (ethnic status) was found to have
interactive effects that were statistically
significant, even given the relatively high
Statistical power for testing for interactive
effects in this study, this is not a cause for
concern. The exceptional case (concerning the effects of maternal education on
IQ for black as compared to white
children, and in the causal effects of employment and education on income for
black as compared to white families) necessitated estimating the structural equations separately for black and for white
children.

Multiple regression analyses provided
the estimates of causal effects in the
model. Unstandardized coefficients were
used to permit direct interpretation in the
original units, e.g., years of education per
year of maternal age. As noted, the procedure is slightly unusual in that we did not

attempt to estimate causal pathways between all endogenous variables. Specifically, we have omitted relationships
among variables within a tier. In consequence, each coefficient excludes effects
which operate through other variables at
that tier, if any.

Analysis of six populations provides for
the rigorous test of consistency or replication of findings. Thus, consistent findings
suggest that the findings have some

general significance, but equally, inconsistencies demand investigation of their
cause—for instance, generation effects,
age of child, year of study, characteristics

direct effect of maternal age on child’s 1Q
(mediated through Linear Maternal Age,
and quite small), the main interest here is
to estimate the indirect effects of this relationship. Thus, estimates of effects from

ples there seemed to be a significant tendency for the children of teenaged
mothers to live in “broken” homes, i.e.,

homes not headed by both biological

parents. This tendency is strongest in the
HES Cycle II data, with 11 and 14 per cent
excess risk for white and black children respectively. The Cycle III black sample did
not show an excess risk of broken homes
for the older children (age range 12~17
years) of teenaged mothers. In the CPP
data sets the differential risk was only one
half as large as the Cycle II values.
Teenage maternity had a large effect on
the education of mothers in five of six samples. As before, the Cycle III black sample
was the exception. The other two black
samples had much smaller effects than the
white samples. This may be explained by

the fact that the overall low level of education of black mothers, 9.3 and 9.4 years in
Cycle II and III respectively, meant that
even early childbearing would typically
postdate the completion of education for
these women. A similar explanation is offered for race differences in the effect of
teenaged motherhood on paternal education. Only in the more recent CPP sample
does the educational level of black parents
begin to be high enough to be influenced
by childbearing.

The effects of teenaged motherhood on
maternal employment are inconsistent.
Teenage Maternity was therefore clearly
associated with a greater risk of broken
home and lower parental education but
not consistently with maternal employment.

FAMILY INCOME AND FAMILY SIZE

Family Income.—Table 5 shows the estimated effects of all prior variables on
family income. With regard to the maternal age variables, they rarely had a
significant effect on family income. When
they were present, the signs of these effects were in opposite directions and effects were of modest size, all of which lead
us to doubt their prognostic significance.

In contrast to the maternal age variables, parental education, employment,
and the presence of a male guardian had
large effects on the annual incomes of
families. The tendency for the Cycle II

coefficients to be smallest and the CPP
coefficients to be largest may be partially
explained by the effects of inflation which
occurred from the data collection for Cycle II beginning in 1963 to the CPP data
collection which ended in 1973. Inflation —
does not explain the differences in effects
for white and black samples, however.
Each additional year of paternal education brought only 50 to 60 per cent as much
increase in family income for black families as for white families. Maternal education also had comparably smaller consequences for black family income of
children in the HES samples; in the CPP
data set this difference disappeared.
Parental employment had effects on the
family income of all samples in which it

was measured; differences between race
effects are not consistent. As anticipated,
the effects of paternal employment are
larger than those of maternal employment, reflecting the greater earning capacity of males. The effects on family income
of no male guardian were large in all samples; as would be expected, they were
larger in the white samples than in the
black samples, a finding again reflecting
differences in earning capacity. The effects of other family structure variations
were inconsistent. Birth order tended to
have a positive relationship with family income when measured during elementary
school years. One possible explanation for
this is that it reflects difference in the ages

grandparents, other relatives, or nonrelatives—had more younger children than
did families headed by the natural parents
in all HES samples. This effect was especially large in the black sample. Other
family structure effects varied from sample to sample.

dictors and a reasonable explanation of
this resides in its probable low validity

THE DireEcT EFFECTS OF ALL
VARIABLES ON IQ

The direct effects of all variables in the
model on the child’s IQ are presented in
Table 7. In no sample was there a
significant direct effect of Teenage Maternity on the child’s IQ. The Linear Maternal Age effect was, however, significant in five of six samples. The exception
was the Cycle III black sample. This effect
was modest in size, ranging from 0.09 to
0.21 IQ points per year of maternal age.
The standard deviation of maternal age
within birth order groups ranged from
about five to about six years. Thus, an increase in mother’s age of about one standard deviation led to an increase in the IQ
of the offspring of no more than about one
IQ point. Apparent race differences in
these effects in no case reached statistical
significance.

The effects of maternal education on
IQ were significant in all six samples. They
were much larger than the Linear Material
Age effects in the sense that a year’s delay
in childbearing had less consequence than
an additional year of education. The effects exceeded one IQ point per year of
maternal education in all white samples;
these effects were much smaller in the
black samples. The effects of paternal
education were smaller than those of maternal education, and the race differences
in magnitudes were not so marked.

Maternal employment was significant

The only available indicator of family size was
the number of persons in the household under the
age of 20. Since the study children were ages 12-17,
in many families older siblings would already have
left the household and/or reached the age of 20.
Thus, the average family size, as measured, was
smallest in this sample, in spite of the fact that unlike
the other samples these families would be predominantly complete and historically expected to be at
least as large as those of the other samples.

Social Biology

in three samples. It had an apparent deleterious effect (—1.56 IQ points) on
children’s IQ’s in the Cycle II white sample, but a positive effect in both CPP samples.

In the two samples of young white
children from Cycle II and the CPP there
was a negative effect of father absence, of
3.40 and 2.46 IQ points respectively. A
smaller negative effect was significant in
the CPP black sample. Other family structure effects were inconsistent.

Twins examined in each of the six samples had lower IQ’s than would have been
expected. The estimate of this effect
ranged from 3.14 IQ points to 6.71 IQ
points and was consistently larger in the
black samples.

Family income had a significant effect
on the child’s IQ in all samples. The size of
this effect ranged from over one IQ point
per thousand dollars in the Cycle II samples to about one-third of an IQ point in
the CPP samples. Some portion of this discrepancy may be attributable to inflation
occurring between the data collection periods. However, even adjusted for
inflation, the earlier estimates would
probably be twice the size of the more recent effects. This raises the question as to
whether there was a trend toward decreasing the role of family income in the availability of intelligence enhancing resources
over this period. Alternatively, this difference may reflect a difference in the effects of income in urban samples (CPP) as
compared to a broad national sample.

A birth order effect on intelligence was
inconsistent and present in only two samples. The negative effect of family size on
IQ was significant in all six samples, although the magnitude of the effect varied
across samples.

In summary, the results presented in
Tables 4-7 show that Teenage Maternity
was associated with a greater risk of broken homes and lower parental education.

The variable had no consistent direct effects on income or family size or on IQ.
Linear Maternal Age had a consistent effect on family size and child’s [Q.

CAUSAL PATHWAYS

As previously stated, a major goal of
the current study was to provide estimates
of indirect effects. These effects are determined as products of effects as traced from
the origin to the ultimate dependent variable and then summed across alternate
paths. For example, for the Cycle II white
children the indirect effect of Teenage
Maternity via the father’s employment
variable is —0.043 (the effect on father’s
employment) times —0.30 (the effect of
father’s employment on family size) times
—1.05 (the effect of family size on IQ) =
—0.01, plus —0.043 times 1.14 (the effect
of father’s employment on income) times
1.03 (the effect of income on IQ) = 1.05,
or —0.06.

In Table 8 the direct and indirect effects
of Teenage Maternity in all six samples are
summarized. Since all numbers are in IQ
units we may directly compare their

Teenaged Motherhood

151

values. The most striking effects come
from the lowered parental education attributable to teenaged motherhood in the
white samples amounting to 2.4-3.3 IQ
points. Changes in family structure associated with teenage maternity have very
little effect on IQ level, never as large as
half an IQ point. The positive effect on IQ
via the tendency of the most recent cohorts of teenaged mothers to have fewer
subsequent children than would have
been expected is small but encouraging.
Finally, it should be said that the effects
for the most recent cohort of black
children in the CPP look much more like
those for the white children than did earlier cohorts.

In Table 9 the direct and indirect effects
of Linear Maternal Age on IQ are summarized. Each effect is stated as a change in
IQ per year of maternal age. Unlike the
previous table in which no direct effects
were significant, direct effects dominate
the Linear Maternal Age findings. The
major source of indirect effect is family
size, which as noted earlier is a measure of
births subsequent to the study child once

we partial the effects of birth order. These
effects are partly counterbalanced by
small negative effects attributable to cohort effects on education. Other effects
are quite small and inconsistent. The
direct effects are much closer in value than
are the total effects, which appear to be
more sensitive to cohort and/or age of
child effects.

DISCUSSION

Each of the samples analyzed in this research led to the conclusion that to the extent that Teenage Maternity affects offspring it does so by means of parental
education. As noted earlier, two variables
which we were unable to include in our
analysis may well alter our estimates of the
effects of teenaged motherhood on educational attainment.

One variable is the socioeconomic status of the family of origin of the mothers.
Girls from lower class homes may be both
less inclined and able to opt for more education and more inclined to opt for early
childbearing (or less able to avoid it). The
second possible confounding variable is
maternal IQ. It is reasonable to suppose

that maternal IQ will directly affect her
own educational achievement and also her
child’s IQ. In addition, it may affect her
decision to bear children while still young
(or her ability to avoid so doing).
Fortunately, we may use the estimates
generated in Card’s (1978) study of Project Talent data to remove the “spurious”
portion of the estimate of the effect of
teenaged motherhood on education. According to Card’s model which uses standardized coefficients, parental social class
had an effect on childbearing history (as of
age 29) of —0.15 and on educational attainment of 0.11; academic aptitude (here
an appropriate surrogate for maternal IQ)
had effects of —0.17 on childbearing history and 0.41 on educational attainment.
Card estimates the direct effect of childbearing history on educational attainment
to be 0.38. If one uses the standard deviations of the variables in the present project
to convert these standardized coefficients,
the resulting estimates suggest that about
half of the estimated effect of teenaged
motherhood on mother’s education may
be attributable to these common causes.
A second study by Hofferth and Moore
(1979) also investigated a causal model us
i"

Vol. 27, No. 2

ing these variables, this time employing
data from the National Longitudinal
Study of the Labor Market Experiences of
Young Women of the U.S. Department of
Labor and the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics funded by the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare. In this
investigation the causal model employed
explicitly assumed that in addition to an
effect of teenaged motherhood on maternal education, one would find an effect
of education on the probability of early
motherhood. Because of noncomparability of sampling frames, cohorts, and
method of analysis we cannot directly employ the resulting estimates to “‘correct”’
our model. However, there are two aspects of the Hofferth and Moore model
which may be helpful in assessing our
model. First, they estimate teenage childbearing and maternal education to have
causal effects on each other of approximately similar magnitude. Second, according to their model the effects of
parental social class operated entirely
through the educational variable and did
not have a direct effect on age at first birth.
It would be reasonable to suppose that
prior academic achievement would also
operate on childbearing through the education variable.

Taken together, these findings might
lead us to estimate that about half of the
estimated effect of Teenage Maternity on
maternal education in the current study
could be considered a true causal effect.
Passing this coefficient along, and given
the dominance of the educational! variables in accounting for the differences in
mean IQ between children of teenaged
mothers and older mothers, we might expect the overall indirect effect through
maternal education to be about half as
large as those provided in Table 8. If we
were to use the Rindfuss et al. (1980) estimate that the maternal-age—maternaleducation effect is entirely attributable to

Teenaged Motherhood 153

the causal impact of the latter on the former, we would have to consider all of the
“indirect” effect through this route to be
spurious. No causal analysis of the effects
of maternal age at first birth and paternal
education (controlling for maternal education) were found in the literature. Thus,
the indirect effect through paternal education may tentatively be considered nonspurious. |

On the other hand, the Linear Maternal Age effect on children’s IQ was predominantly a direct effect, not mediated
by social or demographic factors.

CONCLUSION

The path analytic model presented
here allows us to disentangle the relations
between two maternal age variables (Linear Maternal Age and Teenage Maternity) and child’s IQ. We show that Linear
Maternal Age has a direct effect on child’s
1Q, which though consistent is very small
and which is neither increased nor decreased when other variables are introduced. By contrast, Teenage Maternity
has no direct effect on child’s IQ, but has a
marked association with parental education which can be shown in turn to have a
significant effect on child’s IQ. Thus, educational level of the young parents accounts almost entirely for the disadvantage in terms of IQ of the offspring of
teenaged mothers.

Surprisingly, there was little or no effect of differences in family structure on
the IQ of offspring of teenage mothers.
This was true in spite of the commonness
of the deviant household pattern in which
they were found to live.

A reasonable interpretation of our
findings is that if youthful childbearing
were not necessarily to be associated with
interrupted education, then the offspring
would suffer little or no disadvantage in
terms of IQ. It seems that in terms of off

spring IO any biological disadvantage of
very early motherhood (a direct effect) is
at most trivial. Constructive interventions
that emphasize continuing education
adapted to the circumstances of the
teenaged mothers would seem to have a
useful place.

On the other hand, the relatively small
IQ disadvantage to offspring of teenage
mothers is noted. Teenage childbearing

may handicap the parents more gravely
than it does their offspring.
