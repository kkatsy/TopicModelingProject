ABSTRACT: Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory scores, obtained on a sample of 154 black and 190
white same-sex twin pairs attending Philadelphia area schools, are analyzed to determine the
effect of skin color on self-esteem. Skin color alone, and therefore race which is highly correlated
with skin color, has no effect upon self-esteem.

In a previous paper we analyzed the
genetic and environmental determinants
of variation in skin color (Post and Rao,
1977). Here we report on the effect of skin
color on self-esteem. The use of the
Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory
(Coopersmith, 1967) and the photo-electric
measurement of skin color, as part of the
Philadelphia Twin Study, allow us to examine the effect of skin color on selfesteem.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample consists of 348 same-sex
twin pairs ranging from 10 to 15 years of
age. Sixty monozygotic (MZ) and 94 dizygotic (DZ) are blacks and 104 MZ and
86 DZ are whites. Assignment of individuals to race is based on information
supplied by the subjects and their appearance with respect to skin color, hair form,
and various facial features. Zygosity was
determined by allotyping 19 red-cell antigen, serum protein, and erythrocyte enzyme polymorphisms.

Skin reflectance was measured either
with a Model 610 or a Model 670 Photovolt reflection meter. The two instruments
were checked against each other and
found to give identical readings. The
filters used were standard plain glass

ot

Corning filters, blue (CS5— 60/5543), green
(CS4-64/4010), and red (CS-—59/2404),
measuring 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mm thick,
respectively. Measurements were taken on
(1) the forehead over the glabella, (2) the
flexor surface of the forearm approximately midway between the wrist and
ulnar-humeral joint, and (3) the medial
aspect of the upper arm just distal to the
axilla. Aj] areas were cleansed at least one
hour prior to measurement with cotton
and isopropyl] rubbing alcohol. Additional
details concerning instrumentation and
measurement technique were given by
Post et al. (1976).

The CSEI measures evaluative attitudes toward the self in social, academic,
family, and personal areas of experience.
The subject answers fifty short statements
(Form A), e.g., “I’m easy to like,” by placing a check in either the “like me” or “unlike me” column alongside each statement.
A total score is derived by adding the total
number of positive responses for a maximum score of fifty. Each of the fifty statements comprising the CSEI total score are
assigned to one and only one of four subscales, general self (CGS), social self—peer
(CPS), home-parents (CH), or school—
academic (CS). These are scored separately. A separate lie scale, consisting of

eight items interspersed among the other
questions, assesses extreme socialized response sets. Socioeconomic status is based
on parental income and census track data.

Analysis of the data was carried out
using the computer programs MULREG,
LIST, PHEIGEN, and COMVAR at the
Population Genetics Laboratory, University of Hawaii (for descriptions, see Morton, 1974; Rao et al., 1974).

RESULTS

REDUCTION OF THE DATA

Low lie scores gave no evidence that the
subjects were giving socially conforming
or acceptable responses, giving us confidence that honest answers were given
to the remaining fifty questions.

A 4 X 4 matrix of correlations between
the four subscales of the CSEI total score
yields the first eigen value, 3.104. Selfesteem (SE) is here defined as the first
principal component of the scores of these
four variables. (SE) = (0.559(CGS) +
(0.490)(CH) + (0.474)(CPS) + (0.472)(CS)
where the numerical constants constitute
the first eigen vector of the correlation matrix. All the individual variables get nearly
equal weights. The weighted score, SE,
explains 78 per cent of the total variability
in the data.

The first principal component of the
nine skin reflectance measures is defined
as the skin color phenotype (Post and Rao,

Social Biology

1977). Age and sex effects were removed
by quadratic regression.

For each twin pair, the socioeconomic
status was recorded as low (1) or high (2)
which is defined here as an estimate of the
environment common to the two members
of a twin pair, called Index I. In this way
we define five variables:

X, = self-esteem (SE) of twin

X_ = SE of co-twin

X3 = index of their common environment

X, = skin color phenotype of twin (an estimate of the twin’s skin color genotype)

Xs = skin color of co-twin.,

Observed correlations between these
five variables are shown in Table 1, which
will be analyzed according to the path
analysis model described below.

MODEL AND ANALYSIS

The path analytic model is described in
Figure 1, which is a simplified combination of Figures 1 and 5 of Rao et al. (1974).
Underlying assumptions are: (1) Relationships between all pairs of the five observed
variables are linear, and the effects of
genotype, common environment, and skin
color are additive (and hence dominance
and other interactions are negligible); and
(2) genotype and common environment are
uncorrelated.

Expected correlations between the five
(observed) variables are presented in
Table 2 and are functions of seven parameters (see Figure 1):

Estimation of the parameters and tests of
relevant hypotheses are carried out using
the approach of Rao et al. (1974) which is
briefly outlined here. Under our model
there are only eight observed correlations
having different expectations (see Table
2). Multiple observed correlations having
the same expectation are pooled into one
estimate. Let z; and 2; denote the
z-transforms of the ith observed and expected correlations (2; is bias-corrected).

where , = numbers of pairs of observations used in computing the ith correlation, and x? follows a chi-square distribution on 8-k d.f. when & parameters are
estimated. Parameters are estimated by
minimizing x”, and the residual x? is used
to test hypotheses. x’x, — x7, yields a
likelihood-ratio-test for testing the null
hypothesis Hy against the alternative hypothesis H.

Consider all correlations between X,,
Xe, X3, X4, and X;5. These correlations
generate 8 equations in 7 unknowns (general model), leaving 1 d.f. for testing
goodness-of-fit of the model. The complete
model in 7 parameters fits very well leaving a residual xy? = 2.34 on 1 d.f. When
the direct effect of skin color is eliminated
by setting g = O and estimating the remaining 6 parameters, we get a residual
x’? = 3.05 on 2 d.f. The likelihood ratio
test for g = 0 yields x,’ = 3.05 — 2.34 =
0.71 on 1 d.f., and therefore we conclude
that differences in self-esteem among skin
colors have no genetic component. Since
race and skin color are very highly correlated (Post and Rao, 1977), one may tentatively conclude that racial differences in
self-esteem have no genetic basis.

Social Biology

Finally, an examination of the underlying assumptions would be instructive. The
assumption of linearity is perhaps most
pertinent to skin color and self-esteem.
Regression of SE on skin color yielded
nonsignificant quadratic terms (F-value
on 1 and 718 d.f. = 0.87). The concept of
dominance for polygenes has been questioned (Morton, 1974) and, if significant,
would tend to elevate heritability in this
material. As for gene-environment covariance, excellent fit of the general
model leaves no evidence in favor of it.
Finally, it should be noted that the various
correlation estimates are assumed to be
independent, even though they are all estimated from the same data. Our experience with lipoprotein data suggests that
this assumption does not create any systematic bias (Rao et al., in press).
